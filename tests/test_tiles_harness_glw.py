"""The [tiles] gate harness declares its downward longwave, or leaves it alone.

The GLW lane made downward longwave a source with a disposition: a run
either has a longwave scheme, or declares a constant, or is refused.  The
tilestream gate arrived from a tree that predates that lane and its
``+Noah LSM`` rungs pair a land-surface scheme with radiation off, which
is the ``"consumed"`` case: no scheme computes GLW and Noah reads it every
surface step.  Five gate cases raised the refusal on the first run from
the integrated tree, which is the seam the integration map predicted and
nothing in the 233/0 had ever seen.

``harness.declared_glw_kwargs`` is the fix and this suite is its contract.
Two properties, and the second is the one that keeps the fix accurate:

  * a rung whose GLW is consumed or published DECLARES the constant, so
    the refusal cannot fire and the receipt names an origin;
  * a rung that has a longwave scheme, or no consumer at all, is left
    untouched, so nothing overrides a scheme's own field and no digest in
    the gate moves.

The classification is never restated here or in the harness: both read
``physics_compat.downward_longwave_disposition``, and this suite drives
that same function to build its expectations, so a future change to the
disposition moves the harness and the test together instead of leaving
one of them describing a rule that no longer exists.

CPU only, no card: the whole question is which keyword argument gets
passed, and that is decided before any allocation.
