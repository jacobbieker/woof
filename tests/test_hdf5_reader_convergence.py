"""One HDF5 reader per workspace, and the pin that keeps it one.

``netcrust`` is the tree's NetCDF read facade.  It reaches HDF5 two ways:
directly, through a ``hdf5-reader`` PATH dependency on the hardened
vendored copy, and indirectly, through ``netcdf-reader 0.3`` -- which
declares ``hdf5-reader = "0.3"`` and therefore resolves the crates.io
package unless the workspace redirects it.

``tools/rustwx`` carries that redirect.  ``tools/rw_wps`` did not, so its
``Cargo.lock`` locked TWO packages both named ``hdf5-reader 0.3.0``, and
the one that actually built netcrust's variable and dimension tables was
the stock registry crate -- 2782 lines of ``dataset.rs`` against the
vendored copy's 2874.

The concrete breakage that caused, measured on this tree: every file
written by ``netCDF4.Dataset(path, "w")`` refused inside
``gpuwm_mapped_engine`` with

    HDF5 error: checksum mismatch: expected 0x00000000, got 0xa31af89a

while the shipped ``rw_netcdf.exe`` -- same netcrust source, built inside
the patched rustwx workspace -- read the identical bytes and enumerated
every variable.  Four NetCDF suites went from 22 failures to 18 on the
one-line fix, so this is not a tidiness pin: it is the difference between
the mapped engine reading woof's own NetCDF-4 corpus and refusing it.

These are text gates on purpose, in the ``test_grib_core_convergence``
tradition: they read manifests and lockfiles, need no Rust toolchain, and
so they run on every commit rather than at a cut.
