"""Live smoke for the packaged acquisition routes.

The rule this suite is written under: a fetch test must not download
gigabytes.  Route resolution is proved with a ranged read of the first
few bytes of each route's real first object -- which checks the host,
the key grammar, the cycle stamp, the lead stamp AND that the payload is
the product the row claims -- and exactly one small end-to-end runs the
whole front door on real bytes.

Gated twice: the ``network`` marker and ``WOOF_NETWORK_TESTS=1``.
