"""CLI verify-driver tests.

The gate plumbing is CPU-only: the single-sourced GATES exports (each case
module owns its gate intervals; cli._GATES and the benchmark tests consume
that one export), the _failing_gate semantics (strict bounds, None =
unbounded on EITHER side, NaN fails), and the exit-0/exit-1 paths via a
stubbed case runner.  The end-to-end straka subprocess run stays a GPU
test.
