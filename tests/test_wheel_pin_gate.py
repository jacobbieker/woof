"""No wheel can be built while the packaged bridge pins pin nothing.

The breakage this gate prevents, measured on the 2.5.0 release
candidate: ``tools/build_bridge_bundle.py pin`` was skipped before the
wheel build, so the wheel shipped ``woof/data/bridges/bridge-pins.json``
with ``release: null`` and ``platforms: {}``.  On a clean home
(``USERPROFILE`` redirected to an empty directory), ``pip install recast-woof
&& woof setup`` then reported FAILED bridges -- no GRIB decoder, no
NetCDF decoder, ``renderer rw_wrfbatch: not built`` -- every Rust door
of a fresh install dead, while every check on the builder's own box
passed because its bridges were staged long ago.  The pin step existed
the whole time; nothing made skipping it fail.

Now something does: ``setup.py`` refuses ``bdist_wheel`` while the pins
document declares no release and no platforms, and it fires in
``run``, before a byte is packed, on every route a release wheel is
built by -- ``python -m build``, ``pip wheel .``, ``pip install <tree>``
and ``python setup.py bdist_wheel`` all pass through that command.
``WOOF_ALLOW_UNPINNED_WHEEL=1`` is the explicit dev override for a
wheel that will never be published (this suite's own fixtures use it);
an override is a workaround, never a fix, and the built wheel stays
exactly as unshippable as before.

Both directions are proven here (validate the instrument): the refusal
on an unpinned tree -- including THIS repository's real tree, whose
committed pins are empty by owner ruling -- and the pass on a pinned
one, via a synthetic package small enough to build in seconds.
