"""The sweep's two essential claims, checked mechanically.

1. The neighborhood is a square SIDE LENGTH, not a radius.  Every
   comparison in ``docs/da-vs-wofs.md`` against published WoFS skill
   turns on this, because the WoFS literature uses both conventions and
   they differ by a factor of two in linear scale.

2. The scorer uses the gallery's constants, not its own.  A sweep that
   scored itself on a different threshold or a different box than the
   figures would produce numbers that look comparable and are not.

3. There is exactly ONE scorer of record -- ``tools/da_sweep_score.py``
   -- and any other scorer is a caller of it.  Two scorers with two
   copies of the same constants agreed at 3 km and only at 3 km; the
   copy meant a different metric on any other grid while reporting it
   under the same name.  The last block below holds the unification.
