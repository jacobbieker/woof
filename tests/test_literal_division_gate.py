"""A146 gate, compiler layer: no float division NVRTC rewrites on Blackwell.

The breakage this prevents: NVRTC's NVVM, for compute_100 and compute_120
(every Blackwell card: RTX 5090, 5070 Ti, PRO 4500, PRO 6000) under
``-ftz=true`` (which CuPy appends to every ``RawModule``), compiles
``x / C`` for a compile-time constant ``C`` as ``x * RN(1/C)``.  That is not
IEEE division: on an RTX 5070 Ti with NVRTC 13.4, exhaustively over every
float in [1, 2), ``x / 3.0f`` is one ULP off for 33 percent of inputs,
``x / 60.0f`` (the advection flux) for 65 percent, ``x / 9.81f`` for 0.08
percent, while compute_90 and older keep ``div.rn`` and round correctly.
NVRTC 12.9, 13.0, 13.3 and 13.4 all do it; ``-prec-div=true``,
``-fmad=false`` and ``-Xptxas -O0`` do not stop it.  ``__fdiv_rn(x, C)`` is
never rewritten and is the IEEE quotient on every card, with the module's
own FTZ mode, so it is the one spelling a kernel may use for such a
division.  A power-of-two, zero or infinite divisor has an exact reciprocal
and either spelling is IEEE.

Two layers, because a source scan cannot see every such division (a
divisor can arrive through a local constant, an integer literal or a helper
inlined with a literal argument) and the compiler census needs NVRTC:

* the source scan (tests/test_literal_division_source_gate.py, no CuPy)
  runs on every leg and names the file, line and divisor;
* this file, on the GPU shard, compiles every production -ftz=true
  translation unit.  For compute_89, where a constant division is still a
  ``div.rn``, it requires no ``div.rn`` with an immediate divisor.  Then it
  compares compute_120 under ``-ftz=false`` (where a constant division stays
  a ``div.rn``) with compute_120 under ``-ftz=true`` line by line and
  requires no line that loses a ``div.rn`` under ``-ftz=true`` while its
  multiplies gain an immediate with an inexact reciprocal: that catches a
  divisor compute_120 alone constant-folds (``tgammaf(4.0f)`` under NVRTC
  13.4.92) and constant divisions compute_89 merges into one ``div.rn`` of
  a selected register, which the first census could not see.  A line whose
  divisions are all ``__fdiv_rn`` is not listed: compute_120 may fold such
  a call on constants, and the folded value is the IEEE quotient.

The line comparison's reference is the same architecture (A174).  It was
compute_89, and NVRTC 12.9.86 (the default ``recast-woof[gpu]`` compiler) compiles
``powf`` and ``logf`` differently for the two architectures (noah's as
separate functions on compute_120, inlined on compute_89), so per-line counts
moved on seven lines of noah, nssl2_nucond, shinhong and thompson that hold
no constant division, and this file failed twice on every host under the
default install.
