"""The SFLX-prefix batch, and the slot orders it depends on.

``tests/test_noahmp_leaf_batches_cuda.py`` already holds
:func:`woof.core.noahmp_sflx_pre_gpu.evaluate_sflx_pre_calls` to the CPython
``sflx_pre`` bit for bit on the physical calls the four whole-column WRF
fixtures pause at, and already shows that comparison rejecting a misrouted
column.  This file adds the two falsifications that are specific to *this*
packer, because a misroute and a slot transposition are different defects and
only one of them is covered by swapping two answers:

* ATM is reached through a **flat 11-slot input row and a flat 17-slot output
  row**.  Nothing in either row is named on the device; a value in the wrong
  slot is silently a different physical quantity.  Both orders are held here by
  transposing two entries of the module's own tables and requiring the answer
  to move.

No arithmetic is gated here.  ``noahmp_leaf_atm``, ``k_sflx_marshal``,
``noahmp_phenology`` and ``noahmp_precip_heat`` are each already bitwise
against their own unmodified-WRF oracle CSV in
``tests/test_noahmp_vegprecip_cuda.py``, ``tests/test_noahmp_sflx_cuda.py`` and
the leaves suite.  The composition adds packing and nothing else, so packing is
what this file attacks.
