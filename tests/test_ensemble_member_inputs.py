"""Every member of an N > 1 ensemble runs its own inputs, or the request is refused.

The defect these hold closed: the public ``--members N`` door prepared one
trajectory, handed it to every member, and published spread maps (zero
everywhere) and probability maps (0 or 1) from N copies of one forecast.

A plain member count now takes the automatic choice of the recipe planner
(the operational ensemble the source's adapter row declares) through the
recipe door.  Where no such ensemble is declared, and at every door that
holds one input, the request is refused by name with the remedy.
