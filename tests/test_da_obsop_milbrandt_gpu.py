"""GPU gate: the Milbrandt-Yau (mp_physics=9) reflectivity route of H_Z(x).

Its own file, and gpu-marked, for the reason
``test_da_obsop_nssl_gpu.py`` is: the scheme's Z is CUDA only, there is no
float64 column mirror in ``woof.verify.npref``, and the host path names a
refusal instead.

What this file proves is the claim that made mp=9 an observation operator
at all (audit R-015 / R-050): the Z block of
``mp_milbrandt2mom_main``'s final diagnostics is SEPARABLE from the state
update it sits beside.  ``woof/core/kernels/milbrandt2_zet.cu`` is a
transcription of that block, and the first test drives BOTH kernels over
the same random state and compares the two dBZ fields bitwise -- so the
duplication the loader forces (``cupy.RawModule`` has no ``#include``) is
held to the original by measurement rather than by review, and the
operator cannot quietly become a fourth Z formula.
