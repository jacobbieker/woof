"""The UCM's Noah coupling against WRF v4.7.1's own ``lsm``, bit for bit.

``tools/urban_wrf471_oracle/ucm_noah_oracle.F90`` calls the byte-unmodified
``lsm`` (``module_sf_noahdrv.F``) with ``sf_urban_physics = 1`` over fifteen
urban columns and one grass column for four carried steps: the three NLCD
urban types, table urban fractions plus FRC 0.05, 0.99 and 1.0, exchange
coefficients under the 1.0E-02 floors, day, a calm night (the 1 m/s wind
clamp) and rain.  WRF runs the UCM inside Noah's column loop; woof runs it
after the LSM on the rural values the LSM hands over.  The fixture carries
those values as WRF held them at the UCM's entry, read through one inserted
statement whose build proves it perturbs nothing (``build_ucm_noah.sh``).

**Measured: every blended grid field (TSK HFX QFX LH GRDFLX ALBEDO QSFC UST
and the floored CHS CHS2 CQS2), every urban state word and every per-step
urban output (TS SH LH G RN PSIM PSIH GZ1OZ0 U10 V10 TH2 Q2 UST AKMS) is
bit-identical to WRF on all 60 urban column steps**, from recorded and from
carried state, and the grass column is left untouched.

What this does NOT prove: that woof's Noah kernel hands over WRF's rural
values.  That is the LSM hook's own gate (the infra lane's
``tests/test_urban_noah_hook_wrf471_parity.py``), and this fixture's
``tap_*`` columns are exactly the words it has to reproduce.
