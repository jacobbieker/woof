"""Advection at WRF vert_order 5 against the compiled HRRR fork routines.

The fixture (tests/data/wrf_legacy_advect) runs the eight real-state cases
of the WRF 4.7.1 fixture, by the same input archives, at
``v_sca_adv_order = v_mom_adv_order = 5`` (operational HRRR).  The
reference of record is NOAA-EMC/HRRR 40ee6058c's WRFV3.9 module_advect_em
(tools/advect_wrf_legacy_oracle); WRF 4.7.1 at the same orders is the
cross-check (``<case>-wrf471.npz``).  Every defined output word is
measured; the CUDA words are pinned to their receipt for exact equality.
