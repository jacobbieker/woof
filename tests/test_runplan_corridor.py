"""Moving nests on run-plan's front door: derived, reported, priced.

1.8.4 sealed the statics corridor at preparation and taught the tree
runner to honour a ``[relocation]`` follow source when one is present.
What a MACHINE caller could not do was produce such a preparation from a
plan document: run-plan's own tests never drove a follow config, and
nothing in ``--resolve`` or ``--estimate`` mentioned a corridor, so a
front end had no way to know a plan would build one, what it would cost,
or -- on the HRRR chain -- that it would fail.

The corridor flag itself turned out to be already flowing: run-plan's
prepared route hands the config to ``go_main``, whose prepare stage
derives ``--statics-corridor`` from the config's own follow predicate.
:func:`test_a_follow_plan_composes_the_corridor_prepare_command` is the
test that was missing under that claim -- it drives the real chain and
reads the composed command -- and the rest of this file is the
reporting, pricing and refusal that genuinely were not there.

CPU-only: the chain is captured at ``go_cli._run_stage``, the seam every
other prepared-route test uses, and no stage subprocess is spawned.
