"""The [tiles] harness declares its shortwave carriers, or leaves them alone.

The SWDOWN/GSW siblings of ``tests/test_tiles_harness_glw.py``, for the
same seam one lane later: the carrier-contract merge (a2ce2b8ff) made
SWDOWN, GSW and COSZEN producer declarations law, and the GLW fix's
harness counterpart was never built for them.  The 2.0 battery paid for
that six times in the consolidated gate (+Noah rungs, SWDOWN), fourteen
times in ``tests/test_ruc_runtime.py`` (GSW), and across the conformance
and pairing fixtures.

``harness.declared_swdown_kwargs``, ``harness.declared_carrier_kwargs``
and ``harness.declare_offline_gsw`` are the fix and this suite is their
contract.  The properties are the GLW suite's, restated for shortwave:

  * a rung whose consumed shortwave carrier has no scheme DECLARES the
    allocation's own zero, so the refusal cannot fire, the receipt names
    an origin, and no digest the gate compares moves;
  * a rung with a shortwave scheme, or with no consumer for the carrier,
    is left untouched, so nothing overrides a scheme's own field.

THE CLASSIFICATION IS NEVER RESTATED HERE OR IN THE HARNESS: which
carriers a scheme consumes comes from
``woof.core.radiation_carriers.consumer_carriers`` -- the consumption
check's own matrix -- and this suite drives that same function to build
its expectations, so a future change to the matrix moves the harness and
the test together.

COSZEN deliberately has no sibling: ``initialize_physics`` itself
attaches the analytic solar-geometry provider under radiation-off
Noah-MP, and any shortwave scheme writes it -- the law already supplies
both producers, and the last test pins that so a matrix change that
breaks the assumption goes red here.

CPU only, no card: the whole question is which keyword argument (or
which forcing call) happens, and that is decided before any allocation.
