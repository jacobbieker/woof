"""A GDAS window may begin on any published lead, and a single lead takes a cadence.

Breakage this prevents: GDAS publishes every hour f000..f009, yet
``--forecast-start-hour 1 --hours 3 --cadence 3`` (leads f001 and f004)
was refused with "--forecast-start-hour 1 is not on the 3 h cadence", a
rule GFS had already dropped, and ``--hours 0 --cadence 3`` (one lead)
was refused with "--cadence does not apply to a single time", which GFS
accepts.  The cadence spaces the leads of a window; it neither fixes where
the window starts nor has anything to break in a window of one lead.

Both doors ask the same resolver: ``woof fetch`` and a ``[fetch]`` table.
