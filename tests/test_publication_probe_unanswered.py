"""A publication probe that was not answered is not a "not published".

The breakage these guard (GS-05): a GEM-GDPS start about a day old was
refused after 284 s as "cycle ... is not published through f006 yet",
because three of its 174 HEADs hit the Windows connect timeout and the
fetch's publication check read every failed HEAD as "not there".  The
same URLs answered 200 in a quarter of a second a little later.  Only
the network is replaced here: the probe, the governor's urlopen wrapper
and the endpoint ladder are the production ones.
