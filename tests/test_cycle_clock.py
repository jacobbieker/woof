"""The cycle clock is the one authority; these tests hold it to that.

Every burn this file guards against is a real one: a dt rounded to the
nearest tick is how a child drifts from its parent over a long cycle
with nothing reporting it, and an analysis time snapped silently onto
the step lattice is how a parent/child tree loses its analysis.
