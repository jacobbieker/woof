"""Every place ``mp_physics=28`` used to fall off the production runtime.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
An auditor traced a real mp=28 forecast and found four places where the
scheme silently stopped being a first-class selector: the restart writer
refused it outright, three REFL_10CM admission gates and a fourth in the
prepared single-domain runner omitted it, the legacy-RRTMG radii table had
no row for it, and the offline downscale child could not read an mp=28
parent.  None of those is a numerics defect and none of them NaNs -- which
is precisely why none of the nineteen column fixtures, the 600-step
forecast smoke, or the three adversarial audits saw them.  They are
REACHABILITY defects, and the only thing that finds a reachability defect
is running the lane.

WHAT IS GATED HERE, AND WHY EACH GATE IS THE SHAPE IT IS
--------------------------------------------------------
1. THE CENSUS (``test_no_stale_pre_28_scheme_admission_tuple_survives``).
   The original pinned-gap test named three paths in ``woof/runtime.py``
   and therefore could not see the FOURTH copy of the same tuple in
   ``woof/prepared_single_domain_forecast.py``.  A test that enumerates
   known sites can only ever be as complete as the last audit.  This one
   walks the AST of every ``.py`` file under ``gpuwm/`` instead and fails
   on the stale literal wherever it appears, so a fifth copy added next
   month cannot hide.

2. THE RESTART ROUND TRIP.  ``tests/test_preflight.py::
   test_mp28_survives_a_restart_round_trip`` gates the manifest layer on
   host arrays.  This gates the FILE: a real device state, ``write_restart``
   to a real ``.npz``, ``restore_restart`` into a second state whose aerosol
   fields were zeroed first, and a BITWISE comparison of all five aerosol
   arrays.  Adding the identity string is what made an mp=28 checkpoint
   possible at all, and an identity string that lets a restart proceed while
   dropping the aerosol state would be worse than the old refusal -- so the
   two new inventory guards are gated in both directions too.

3. THE PACKAGING MEASUREMENT.  ``tests/test_package_data_coverage.py``
   already asserts the ``exclude-package-data`` DECLARATION out of
   ``tomllib`` and MEASURES the wheel contents with setuptools -- but the
   project virtualenv has no setuptools, so the measurement half skips
   exactly where it matters.  The gate here finds an interpreter that does
   have setuptools (this repo's CI image and the system python both do) and
   runs the measurement in a subprocess, so the strongest control on a file
   woof has no right to redistribute is not inert in the environment the
   suite actually runs in.

TWO THINGS THE MEASUREMENT CHANGED ABOUT THE PUBLISHED STORY
-------------------------------------------------------------
The evidence document described the REFL gap as "wrfout frames whose
REFL_10CM was never produced".  Reproducing it showed something stronger:
the tree model gates ``refl_10cm_due`` on the history handler and the clock
only (woof/core/model.py:669-675), so the mp=28 adapter DID stage the field
and the unconsumed stash then raised ``RuntimeError: REFL_10CM stash was not
consumed before reuse`` at the SECOND output frame.  See
:func:`test_the_missing_28_refl_admission_was_a_crash_not_a_missing_field`.

And the restart identity was only half the restart gap.  ``mp_physics=8``
has always bound its four table digests into the physics-setup fingerprint;
mp=28 bound none, so an mp=28 checkpoint could resume against a different
``freezeH2O.dat`` or a different ``CCN_ACTIVATE.BIN`` with every identity
check passing.  For this scheme that is a trajectory substitution: the
activation fraction that sets droplet number is READ out of ``tnccn_act``
(module_mp_thompson.F:5229-5230), not computed.  See
:func:`test_the_mp28_restart_identity_binds_every_table_it_reads`.

ONE DEFECT THIS FILE MEASURES AND DOES NOT FIX
-----------------------------------------------
``woof/core/rrtmgp.py``'s scheme map resolves mp=28 to ``"kessler"``.  The
file belongs to another owner, so it is reported rather than edited; the
measurement, the three consequences and the reason the census tolerates it
are in :data:`KNOWN_SCHEME_KEYED_DICTS_WITHOUT_28`.

TWO SKIP SITES, BOTH NAMED
---------------------------
``test_the_use_mp_re_citation_is_checkable_against_stock_wrf`` skips when the
stock WRF v4.6.1 reference tree is absent, and
``test_the_ccn_activation_blob_is_absent_from_the_built_package_data`` skips
when no interpreter on the machine has setuptools.  Neither swallows a
failure: each names the one missing thing.  If this module is adopted into
``tests/test_thompson_aerosol_gpu.py::_SUITE_MODULES`` they must be added to
that file's ``_SKIP_SITES`` census and to the evidence document's skip table
in the same change.

#: (:5710-5711), so the aerosol-aware package publishes the same field on the
#: same cadence as the classic one.
#:
#: 16 (WDM6) joined 2026-08-09 with the mp=16 port, and it is RE-DERIVED on
#: the same WRF structure rather than added to make a red test green:
#: ``wdm6`` reaches ``refl10cm_wdm6`` from ONE call site
#: (module_mp_wdm6.F:291) inside ``IF (diagflag .and. do_radar_ref == 1)``
#: (:279-280), the identical gate and the identical
#: ``refl_10cm(i,k,j) = max(-35., dBZ(k))`` store (:294).  So mp=16 publishes
#: REFL_10CM on exactly the cadence the other admitted schemes do, and every
#: gate that admits 6/8/10 must admit it.  The lane already moved all four
#: PRODUCTION constants; this pin was the test-side copy and was stale, not
#: wrong-headed.  Unlike 28, WDM6's routine DOES take a number argument
#: (nr1d, :2957) -- that is a producer-side difference (the port gives it its
#: own kernel, woof/core/kernels/wdm6_refl.cu) and changes nothing about
#: admission.
REFL_ADMISSION = frozenset({1, 6, 8, 9, 10, 16, 18, 28, 50})

#: The deliberate exceptions -- NONE remain.  This ledger is the census of

#: go stale; it had, and every clause below is what replaced what it said.
#:
#: It said mp=28 had no ported MIXED nest edge and that every one of its
#: mixed pairs was refused through ``UNVALIDATED_MIXED_EDGE_SELECTORS``.
#: Both edges are ratified: that tuple is now EMPTY
#: (``woof/core/microphysics_transition.py``) and 28 is a member of
#: ``PORTED_MP_PHYSICS`` beside it.  It cited
#: ``tests/test_preflight.py`` pinning ``28 not in mt.PORTED_MP_PHYSICS``;
#: that assertion is now ``28 in mt.PORTED_MP_PHYSICS``.  It derived the
#: HRRR route's admission as ``frozenset(PORTED_MP_PHYSICS) -
#: AEROSOL_LATERAL_BC_BLOCKED_MP_PHYSICS``; that subtraction constant is
#: deleted and ``SUPPORTED_MICROPHYSICS`` is ``frozenset(
#: PORTED_MP_PHYSICS)`` with nothing taken out.  And it restated the
#: retired route premise (no aerosol lateral boundary condition, revisit
#: when a QNWFA/QNIFA ingest lane exists) as though it were live: that
#: ingest lane exists (``woof/ingest/wif_climatology.py``), nwfa/nifa are
#: coupled scalars, and what survives is a DATASET precondition asked of
#: every source -- measured by
#: ``woof.config.mp28_aerosol_lateral_forcing_precondition``, raised
#: BEFORE THE FETCH by ``validate_experiment_preparation`` at the doors
#: that commit to building a forecast, kept as a floor at real
#: initialization, and reported at plan review from the registry's own

#: Re-derived 2026-08-09 against the validator after mp=16 (WDM6) joined
#: it, and again 2026-08-30 for mp=9 (Milbrandt-Yau) and mp=50 (P3), which
#: had been accepted selectors since 1.9 while this copy stayed at the

#: missing here would make the detector blind to a dict keyed on it rather

#:
#: JUDGED at the 2026-08-30 widening -- six dicts entered the census's

#:   rows from Registry.EM_COMMON:3025/:3031, gated by
#:   tests/test_acoustic_npref.py.
#: * ``woof/io/restart.py`` ``MICROPHYSICS_ALGORITHM_IDENTITIES`` omits
#:   9: an mp=9 checkpoint write refuses by name (RestartManifestError,
#:   "cannot identify unsupported microphysics scheme 9").  Fail-loud,
#:   not silent, and composing Milbrandt-Yau's trajectory-identity
#:   string needs the mp=16/28/50 rows' level of scheme study --
#:   NAMED FOLLOW-UP for the restart lane, not a census suppression.
#: * ``woof/wrf_physics_inventory.py`` ``_INVENTORIES`` omits 9 and 16
#:   deliberately: it records EVIDENCED stock-WRF export contracts, which
#:   exist for exactly (6, 8, 10, 18, 28, 50); the rw-wps consuming half
#:   documents the same decision (tools/rw_wps/crates/rw-wps/src/
#:   namelist.rs STOCK_WRF_INVENTORIED_MP_PHYSICS).
#: * ``woof/core/preflight.py`` and ``woof/core/rrtmg_legacy.py`` key
#:   all ten accepted selectors -- complete, nothing to judge.
ACCEPTED_MP_PHYSICS = frozenset({0, 1, 6, 8, 9, 10, 16, 18, 28, 50})

#: Scheme-KEYED DICTS that omit 28, and the judgement for each.  A dict is a
#: third shape the same defect comes in and the AST membership scan cannot
#: see it, so it is scanned separately.
#:
#: * ``microphysics_transition._MASS_FIELDS`` / ``_MOMENT_FIELDS`` are the
#:   MIXED nest-edge inventories.  28 is absent on purpose and the refusal
#:   is named (``UNVALIDATED_MIXED_EDGE_MOMENTS`` records exactly what an
#:   mp=28 mixed edge would have to move).
#:
#: * ``woof/core/rrtmgp.py``'s scheme map is an OPEN DEFECT, measured and
#:   reported by this package rather than fixed here (the file belongs to
#:   another owner).  ``{6: "wsm6", 8: "thompson", 10: "morrison",
#:   18: "nssl"}.get(mp_physics, "kessler")`` resolves mp=28 to "kessler",
#:   with three consequences on the DEFAULT radiation path for an mp=28 run
#:   (rte-rrtmgp): ``ice_active`` becomes False so ``cal_cldfra1`` is called
#:   with ``f_qi = f_qs = False``; ``effective_fields`` stays empty so the
#:   scheme's effc/effi/effs never reach cloud optics; and
#:   ``hydrometeor_paths`` takes its kessler branch, which returns CONSTANT
#:   10 um liquid and 50 um ice radii.  MEASURED on this tree: an
#:   ice-and-snow-bearing column at 258 K/60 kPa and 240 K/40 kPa gets
#:   CLDFRA 1.0 with ice active and 0.0 without -- an overcast ice cloud
#:   radiating as clear sky.  ``woof/core/preflight.py:2713`` already
#:   PRICES mp=28's effective-radius columns on WRF's use_mp_re table, so
#:   the tree currently budgets for radii the radiation never consumes.
#:
#: The assertion below is "no NEW scheme-keyed dict omits 28".  It
#: deliberately TOLERATES the rrtmgp row disappearing (a sibling package may
#: close it in this same wave) while refusing a fresh one.
