"""The render door asks for what the catalog says it can draw, and no more.

WHAT BREAKAGE THESE PIN (gate law).  ``rw_wrfbatch`` exits nonzero when
``summary.failed > 0``, so ONE product it cannot draw for these frames
discards the whole ``--series`` invocation.  Measured on the shipped
2.7.5 wheel, a sub-hourly child series with ``qpf_1h`` forwarded onto
it::

    FAILED qpf_1h F000: invalid store metadata: run wrf/local_... uses an
    exact-time ordinal axis; production batch/windowed rendering is
    disabled until render requests carry exact lead and valid times
    batch render incomplete: rendered=13 skipped=0 failed=13

exit 1, while the identical call without that one slug exits 0 and draws
the same 13 pictures.  On the downscale route that render is the
finalize stage of a finished child, so it turned six and a half hours of
integration into "Forecast failed" over a partial picture tree.

The door's guard used to match two of the catalog's FIVE windowed
outcomes, by their English sentences.  These cases pin the verdict form:
every NAMED slug whose row is not ``renderable`` is dropped with the
engine's own reason, whatever status or wording the row carries, and a
group keyword is never second-guessed.

Nothing here runs a renderer; the rows are the rows the Rust emitter
prints, and the marker parity is pinned by
``tests/test_render_rust.py::test_the_abi_marker_matches_the_rust_source``.
