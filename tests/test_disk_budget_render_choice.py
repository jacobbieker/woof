"""Disk admission charges for pictures only when the run's route draws them.

Breakage these prevent: a run with ``render_products = "none"``, or an
authored experiment config whose route draws nothing by default, was
charged 150 MB of pictures per history frame and refused for a disk it
would never have filled (a 24 hour one-domain run was projected at 3.6 GiB
of which 3.5 GiB were pictures).
