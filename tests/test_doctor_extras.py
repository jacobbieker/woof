"""``woof doctor``'s extras block: every extra, both directions.

A 2026-08-14 reachability audit installed the published wheel into a
clean venv, ran ``woof doctor --explain``, and measured 40,351
characters of report in which the strings ``scipy``, ``pyshp``,
``shapefile``, ``rasterio`` and ``pyproj`` appeared **zero times**.
Doctor probed cupy, wrf and matplotlib and nothing else on the Python
side, so four extras were invisible to the one command whose whole job
is telling a user what their install cannot do.  The same report
labelled ``[render]`` "wrf-rust + matplotlib" -- matplotlib is a base
dependency and the extra's second package is pyshp -- and exited 0 with
"0 of them blocking" on a box that could not run a forecast.

Every test here is written to fail in BOTH directions: it fires when the
thing is missing and stays silent when it is present.  A check that
cannot fail is worse than no check, and this program has had five
instruments give confident wrong answers in one night.
