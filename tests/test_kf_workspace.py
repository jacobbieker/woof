"""The gates the Kain-Fritsch column workspace owns.

The breakage each one prevents, named:

1. ``test_the_kf_frame_stays_under_the_default_stack`` -- the whole point.
   ``kf_column``'s column arrays used to live in the per-thread local frame,
   and CUDA sizes ONE per-context local-memory backing store to the widest
   frame in the context times the card's RESIDENT-THREAD CAPACITY, not times
   the occupancy the kernel achieves.  MEASURED on a development machine (RTX 5070 Ti, 70
   SMs x 1,536, sm_120, NVRTC 13.0.48): the 9,216 B frame at nz = 49 took
   840.0 MiB at first launch and never gave it back -- and that was already
   the SPECIALIZED frame; the unspecialized 24,064 B one took 5,738 MiB.
   Anything that puts a column array back on the stack -- a new
   ``float x[KF_KMAX]``, a compiler that stops eliminating the two that
   stayed -- brings that reservation back, and this is the only assertion
   that catches it on a platform with no recorded row (the RTX 3080 among
   them).

2. ``test_the_workspace_slot_map_fits_the_declared_region`` -- kf.cu's slot
   ids are literal because NVRTC has no ``__COUNTER__``.  A duplicate id
   makes two column arrays alias, which is a wrong forecast and not a crash;
   an id past the cap runs off the end of the block's region into the next
   block's, same result.  This reads the ids straight out of the source.

3. ``test_the_python_side_mirrors_the_kernels_workspace_geometry`` -- the
   launcher allocates the workspace and the kernel indexes it.  If the two
   disagree about slot count, lane width or per-slot extent, the kernel
   writes past the allocation.  Each warp needs its own region even when
   several warps share a block, or columns alias silently.

4. ``test_the_two_stack_arrays_are_the_measured_pair`` -- ``tv_env`` and
   ``positive_energy`` stay on the stack ON PURPOSE, and the purpose is
   bit-identity, not oversight.  A later cut that "finishes the job" by
   moving them would move output bits (55,360 and 34,560 words of a
   410,624-word grade, MEASURED).

5. ``test_the_workspace_is_free_of_residue`` (GPU) -- the workspace is
   allocated with ``cp.empty`` and reused across tiles, exactly as the local
   frame was reused across launches.  That is only sound if no column array
   is ever read before it is written.  This fills the workspace with two
   different garbage patterns and asserts the outputs are bit-identical.

6. ``test_the_tiled_launch_matches_the_single_launch`` (GPU) -- the columns
   go in tiles now, offset by ``col0``.  A tile boundary that dropped or
   double-counted a column, or a workspace not re-initialised between tiles,
   shows up here and nowhere else.
