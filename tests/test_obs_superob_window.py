"""Windowed superob accumulators: the same observations, on 1% of the memory.

A radar is a local instrument on a domain that need not be.  Its gates
occupy a disc about 250 km across; a continental analysis grid is some
5000 km across.  Full-domain accumulators therefore spent 99% of their
bytes holding zeros the antenna could never write to -- measured at 120
bytes per cell per site, which is 10.9 GB per radar on a CONUS 3 km grid
and the single thing standing between a regional system and a continental
one.

The fix windows each contribution to the cells its own radar can reach.
The correctness claim is the strong one, and this file is where it is
made: windowing is a change of ADDRESS, not of arithmetic.  Every value
accumulated is the same float, applied in the same order, to the same
logical cell -- ``np.add.at`` sees an unchanged sequence of additions --
so a windowed analysis is bitwise the analysis the dense code produced,
not merely close to it.

What this file pins:

* bitwise equality against the dense path, on a multi-radar fixture, for
  every array a merge produces -- and an assertion that the window was
  actually smaller than the domain, so the comparison is not vacuous;
* no observation is lost: the windowed contribution accumulates exactly
  the gate counts the dense one did;
* the guard -- a window that under-covers its radar raises rather than
  silently dropping gates, which is the one failure an analysis could not
  detect downstream;
* the degenerate cases: a radar off the grid, and a merge handed a window
  that does not fit.
