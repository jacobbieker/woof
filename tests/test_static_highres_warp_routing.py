"""The high-resolution warp substrate runs on the Rust crate BY DEFAULT.

The breakage these gates prevent, named: through the port-lane
integration the `resample_*` entry points of :mod:`woof.static.highres`
kept their rasterio bodies behind a source comment ("until the port
lanes integrate").  The lanes had landed.  A user who turned
``[static.highres] enabled = true`` on therefore ran GeoTIFF decode,
CRS construction and the warp onto the model grid in Python -- a data
path the project boundary places in the project's Rust -- and nothing told
them: no registry entry, no doctor row, no receipt field, no console
line.  A silent Python data path is exactly what fixed-means-default
exists to stop.

So the assertion here is not "the Rust path works".  It is stronger and
deliberately brutal: with ``rasterio``, ``pyproj`` and ``affine`` made
UNIMPORTABLE, every default high-resolution call must still produce its
answer.  An import of any of the three raises, so a body that quietly
falls back to Python fails loudly instead of passing quietly.

The Python bodies stay, as the parity reference and as the explicit
``WOOF_STATIC_PYTHON=1`` workaround, and the last two tests pin that
they announce themselves once per operation.
