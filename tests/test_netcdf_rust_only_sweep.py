"""Every module that DECODES NetCDF does it in Rust, and none quietly doesn't.

The first pass converted one module and left a dozen. This pins the
result of finishing the sweep, and it pins it by PARSING rather than by
grepping -- a grep counts the comment that explains an absence, which is
how a removal can look like a no-op.

Four lists, and the point is that all four are explicit:

* :data:`_DECODERS` must not import a Python NetCDF library. These read
  meteorological field arrays, so they go through ``rw_netcdf``.
* :data:`_PLUMBING_OR_BLOCKED` may. Each entry carries the reason in the
  table below.
* :data:`_WORKAROUND_ENGINE` may, and has to prove the netCDF4 half is an
  ESCAPE: the default engine is the project's Rust writer and the environment
  variable that reaches netCDF4 is named in the module.
* :data:`_OPEN_FINDINGS` may, and is the accurate one: a data path that has
  NOT been converted, named with the finding against it.  It is EMPTY
  today -- F1 (wrfinput/wrfbdy) and F2 (`woof spectral score`) of the
  2026-08-18 hidden-scope audit were both closed, by separate lanes, and
  each module moved to the list its new state belongs in.  The list stays
  because the next unconverted read needs somewhere to be DECLARED rather
  than excused, and an empty list says "none open" out loud.

A module may not join any of them silently: the test fails if a module
appears in none, so a new ``import netCDF4`` anywhere in the package has
to be argued for here.
