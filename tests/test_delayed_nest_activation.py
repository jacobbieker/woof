"""A nest that activates later than the experiment runs to completion.

Defect #205, the root fix.  Every history frame after the EXPERIMENT's
t = 0 consumed a microphysics-time REFL_10CM stash, so a nest whose first
frame is due at its own later activation epoch consumed a stash no step of
that domain had produced and the run died there:

    RuntimeError: REFL_10CM output is due but no microphysics-time field
    is stashed

deterministically, hours of integration in (32,350 s burned across three
identical supervisor restarts, 2026-08-19).  2.5.0 shipped an upfront
refusal at ``build_experiment`` naming that breakage; this suite is what
retires it.

The contract the consume sites now hold: a domain's stash exists only
after a microphysics step OF THAT DOMAIN has run with ``refl_10cm_due``.
The frame due at the domain's OWN start tick precedes every one of its
steps -- for a domain that starts with the experiment that tick is 0, for
an activating nest it is the activation epoch -- so that one frame carries
no REFL_10CM, exactly as the root's analysis frame always has.
