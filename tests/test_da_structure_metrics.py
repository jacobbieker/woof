"""The structure diagnostics, and the one claim they are there to settle.

A neighborhood score can be won by a field that has diffused its storms
into one smooth patch of above-threshold area, so the scorer of record now
reports object statistics, a radial power spectrum and an intensity
distribution beside FSS.  Those numbers immediately invite a wrong reading:
an ensemble MEAN is smooth because averaging is a spatial filter, not
because its members are smooth, and reporting the mean's object count as
the model's object count would be a measurement of the averaging.

The essential test here is therefore not a recovery test.  It is a
matched pair:

* members that disagree about where their cells are must produce a mean
  with strictly less small-scale variance than any of them -- the claim the
  gallery figure makes; and
* members that agree exactly must produce a mean whose every structure
  number is identical to theirs.

The second is the falsification control.  Without it the first could be
satisfied by any function that returns a smaller number for a field called
"mean", including a bug.
