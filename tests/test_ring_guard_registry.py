"""Ring-guard coverage for EVERY dispatched scheme, derived (CPU only).

NO DEVICE IS IMPORTED HERE, and that is why this module is apart from
``tests/test_mp_spec_zone_ring.py``.  That module opens a card in its
state fixture, so ``tests/conftest.py`` marks the whole file ``gpu`` and
skips it under ``GPUWM_NO_LOCAL_GPU=1`` -- the invocation the lane and
the merge suites run.  These cells are exactly the half of audit R-066 a
parametrised live test could never cover (mp=8 and 28 need the Thompson
tables; 9, 18 and 50 need their own initialisations), so a placement that
skips them on a CPU-only runner and fails to compile on a card-bearing one
retires the coverage it was written to buy.

What the live three-scheme ring pins measure is unchanged and stays in
``tests/test_mp_spec_zone_ring.py``, beside the WRF oracle that motivates
them.
