"""The Machines page's This computer row says which forecast holds the card, not a launch refusal.

The defect this file holds shut: while a forecast ran, the Doing column of
This computer read the job manager's launch refusal, "the GPU is held by
running job job-... so this launch is refused -- poll job_status job-...,
or job_cancel it, then relaunch."  Nothing was being launched, and
job_status and job_cancel are tool names a page user cannot use.  The row
now names the running forecast, when it took the card and links to its
page; the refusal stays with launches, and its tool names stay with the
tools that have them.

Every card lock here is taken by a real launch through the job manager
(a sleeping Python process holds it); no engine and no GPU is used.
