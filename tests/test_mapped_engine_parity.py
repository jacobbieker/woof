"""The mapped-engine parity battery: two engines, one answer, or FAIL.

The gate the decode-vendor design puts on flipping the default mapped
decode engine from Python to Rust.  It runs on REAL staged agency bytes
-- the model-gauntlet staging tree -- never on fixtures written to
flatter either side, and it runs the real ``gpuwm_mapped_engine``
executable rather than a stand-in.

Three things are proven here, and they answer three different questions.

1. **The seam format is lossless** (``frames.json`` + ``frames.f64``).
   Every staged source is decoded by the Python engine -- the behaviour
   of record -- written through the contract codec, and read back.
   Field arrays must be byte-identical, axes and missing counts equal,
   headers equal.  If the format cannot carry the Python engine's own
   answer it cannot carry the Rust engine's either, and every later
   comparison would be measuring the codec instead of the engines.

2. **The goldens are fixed** (``tests/data/mapped_engine_goldens``).
   The same decode is reduced to a parity digest -- per field: units,
   axes, location, staggering, shape, missing count and the SHA-256 of
   the ``<f8`` bytes; per frame: the times, the member, the grid
   fingerprint, the axis hashes and the portable header hash (rule
   gpuwm-portable-frame-header-v1) -- and compared to a
   committed golden.  A source whose Python decode REFUSES has its
   refusal class and message as its golden instead, because a refusal is
   an answer and the two engines have to agree about it too.  These are
   the numbers the Rust engine is measured against, extracted from the
   real Python engine on real bytes by
   ``tools/extract_mapped_engine_goldens.py``.

   Every committed golden DECLARES THE PLATFORM THAT MEASURED IT, and
   the declaration is what decides which reference a row clears; see
   "Platform scope" below.

3. **The engines agree.**  Where the engine implements a subcommand, the
   same source is decoded through it and its digest must equal the
   reference exactly.  An unexplained diff is FAIL: there is no
   tolerance and no "close enough" here, because both engines share
   grib-core lineage and a differing bit is a differing decode, not
   noise.

**Platform scope.**  A committed golden is a measurement of a platform,
not only of a decode.  On the platform that measured it the battery
compares against it byte for byte, exactly as it always did.  On any
other platform the same rows run the LIVE DUAL-ENGINE comparison at the
same strictness instead -- the same source, the same digest function,
the same fields, the Python engine against the Rust engine ON THIS BOX,
byte-identical or FAIL -- because a cross-platform golden diff there
reads a C-runtime difference as an engine defect.  What it never becomes
is a skip: every row still runs both engines and still has a bar to
clear, and the row output names which reference it cleared and why.

Where the vendored engine still refuses a subcommand with class
``not_implemented``, part 3 reports SKIPPED FOR THAT REASON, by name.
It is not silent and it is not green: the battery states which
subcommand is missing, so "the parity battery passes" can never be read
as "the Rust engine was compared" before there is an engine to compare.

# Platform scope: which box's C runtime measured a committed golden.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# MEASURED on a development machine (Linux) 2026-08-18 at 7f0db8ab2, field by field on
# `rap-awip32` -- 22 leaf diffs against the committed golden, and every
# one of them in the DERIVED layer: `eastward_wind`, `northward_wind`,
# `eastward_wind_10m`, `northward_wind_10m` (the grid-relative wind
# rotation) and `specific_humidity` (the relative-humidity derivation),
# plus the v1 raw header hashes that carry those fields. Every DIRECTLY
# DECODED field hashed identical.  And the PYTHON reference engine
# missed exactly the goldens the Rust engine missed, on exactly the same
# rows: 26 failures, 4 python decode + 4 rust decode + 3 rust inspection
# + 7 python compose + 7 rust compose.  Two engines cannot both be wrong
# in the same direction on the same five fields; what differs is the
# platform's libm under the derivation layer.
#
# So a committed golden is a measurement OF A PLATFORM, and it now says
# which.  On that platform the battery compares against it exactly as
# before: no tolerance, no masked member, nothing widened.  Anywhere
# else that comparison reads a C-runtime difference as an engine defect,
# so the row runs the LIVE DUAL-ENGINE comparison instead -- same
# source, same digest function, same fields, Python engine against Rust
# engine ON THIS BOX, byte-identical or FAIL.  That is the parity claim
# this battery exists to make, and it is the half that is portable; the
# committed numbers are not.
#
# The named breakage this prevents: without the scope, a Linux release
# verify reports 26 RED rows that name the Rust engine, when the Rust
# engine reproduced the Python engine's answer on that box exactly --
# and a cut is blocked, or worse, unblocked by someone widening the
# comparison until the derived fields stop being compared at all.
#
# What it must never become is a skip.  Every row still runs both
# engines and still has a bar to clear; only WHICH reference it clears
# against moves, and the row says which and why. Making the derived
# field arrays reproducible across platforms remains GOLD-PORTABLE
# (#157). The v2 digest uses portable headers while retaining the exact
# array comparison, including every libm-dependent field.

#     golden that carried it would only be comparable on the machine
#     that made it.
#     The rule reaches every member that carries one, not only the
#     `inputs` table: `machine_independent` below rewrites the staged
#     paths wherever they appear, which is how the per-field
#     `source_references` and the refusal MESSAGES joined a rule they
#     had been walking past.
#   * decoder identity -- which binary decoded (path, size, hash) and
#     how long it took.  That is exactly what differs BY DESIGN between
#     the two engines, and it is the only thing that may.
#
# Nothing else is masked.  Every number a frame carries is in the digest
# and compared exactly.

    The mask above states the rule -- absolute input paths are keyed by
    BASENAME, because "a golden that carried it would only be comparable
    on the machine that made it" -- and two members walked past it: the
    per-field ``source_references`` an inspection report carries
    (``<input path>:<record index>``), and the refusal MESSAGE an engine
    writes when it names the file it could not satisfy.  Measured on the
    2.5.0 tip: fourteen goldens carried 3,966 absolute paths into one
    developer's staging root, a private reference bundle and a
    ``Downloads`` folder.  Two consequences, both real -- the release
    snapshot's machine-path gate refuses to build a tree carrying them,
    and no second box could ever reproduce those goldens, so the
    battery's parity claim was pinned to one machine while reading as a
    property of the code.

    The replacement is EXACT rather than pattern-matched: the battery
    knows the paths it handed the engines, so it substitutes those
    strings and nothing else.  A path that is not one of this source's
    inputs is left alone, where a regular expression would have to guess
    where a path with a space in it ends -- and one staged tree is
    ``1932-03-21 20CR Member 72 Files``.

    What survives is everything an engine comparison is about: the
    record index after the colon (which message a field came from is a
    number the two engines must agree on), the basename, and every
    hash.  Both sides of every comparison pass through here, so the
    engines are still compared on the same terms.

    ``paths`` names the strings to reduce when the caller knows a set this
    module's decode registry does not -- a COMPOSED source binds a
    supplement, a provenance document and a contributing mapping beside
    its primary inputs, and every one of them is an absolute path on the
    machine that measured.  Omitted, it is this source's decode-row
    inputs, which is what every existing golden was written with.

# `decode` is not the subcommand a mapped preparation runs.  Every
# `mapped_composition_v1` source reaches a complete canonical frame
# through `compose` -- terrain composition, bound-field borrow, the
# coordinate-subset solve -- and `mapped_engine_bridge`'s
# MAPPED_ROUTE_SUBCOMMAND says so.  So the byte work that a bare
# `woof prep` actually performs had no golden at all: the seventeen
# rows above measure the decode UNDER it.
#
# These rows measure the composed answer, from the same real staged
# bytes, through the same Python engine of record.  What a row names is
# the PRIMARY input files, exactly, the way the decode rows do -- a glob
# would quietly change what a golden describes.  Everything else is
# derived from the REGISTRY: the mapping, the composition, the
# provenance document, the contributing donor mappings and the two
# composition roles all come off the packaged profile, so a model added
# as table data inherits a compose golden instead of needing a recipe of
# its own (the arbitrary acceptance test).
