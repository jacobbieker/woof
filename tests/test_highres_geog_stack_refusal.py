"""The high-resolution terrain path refuses BEFORE it downloads.

2.3.2's failure was not that a dependency could be missing.  It was the
ORDER: the only check for rasterio lived inside the mosaic step, which
runs after the tile fetch, so a missing library cost the user 160.7 MiB
of Copernicus downloads and then produced a bare ``RuntimeError``
traceback at exit 1 with no remedy in it.

Three properties are pinned here, and each one failed in 2.3.2:

- the refusal fires with the network provably untouched;
- it is a named :class:`HighresRefusal` carrying the exact install
  command, not a raw exception class;
- ``on_refuse = "fallback-30s"`` does NOT swallow it.  That setting is a
  statement about source *coverage*; letting it apply to a broken install
  would hand back 900 m baseline terrain because a library was missing,
  which is the silent degradation the whole module refuses.

A fourth is pinned since the warp substrate moved to Rust, and it is the
opposite direction: an environment carrying ONLY the shipped default --
the ``static-fields`` library, no rasterio, no pyproj -- must NOT be
refused.  The old spelling of this gate asked "is rasterio importable?",
which after the flip refuses a perfectly good wheel install for missing
a library nothing on the default path reads.  A gate that fires on a
working configuration is not a stricter gate, it is a broken one.
