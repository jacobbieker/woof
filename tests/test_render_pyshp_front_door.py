"""The pyshp prerequisite is answered BEFORE the work, not after it.

The DA nowcast's render stage is the last thing a run does -- after the
survey, the fetch, the preparation, the free forecast and every DA cycle
-- and it opened its basemap with a bare ``import shapefile``.  A run
that was always going to fail therefore failed at the end, with
``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'shapefile'`` and no remedy:
the most work destroyed and the least information given of any failure
in the reachability audit.

These tests bind the fix in both directions, which is the only way a
capability check is worth anything: the refusal must FIRE when pyshp is
absent and must STAY SILENT when it is present.
