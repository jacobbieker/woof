"""CuPy's false CUDA path warning stays off the engine's stderr on Windows.

The breakage: on the Windows managed runtime (the desktop's install, CuPy
14.2 with the CUDA 12 toolkit wheels and no ``CUDA_*`` variables), every
engine command wrote ``cupy/_environment.py:286: UserWarning: CUDA path
could not be detected. Set CUDA_PATH environment variable if CuPy fails to
load.`` to stderr, and the desktop shows a failed command's stderr as its
error text, so every failure a desktop user saw opened on it.  CuPy loaded
fine every time; see ``woof/cupy_windows_warning.py`` for why the warning
is false there and why ``CUDA_PATH`` cannot silence it.

The step that warns runs only on Windows, so these tests stand a stand-in
``cupy`` package up in front of the real one.  It warns with CuPy 14.2's own
words from CuPy's own module name, which is all the engine's filter matches
on, and the platform and site-packages folders are handed in, so the Windows
decision is exercised on any machine.  The last test imports the real CLI.
