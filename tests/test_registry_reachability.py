"""``implemented`` and reachable are independent, so both are declared.

Three schemes reached bitwise parity and had ``implemented: true`` written on
them, and a user could select none of them.  Every template pinned the same
triple (``pbl: ysu``, ``surface_layer: classic-mm5``, ``land_surface: noah``),
the tree route allowed only ``microphysics`` and ``cumulus`` to vary, and the
benchmark route allowed nothing -- so ``implemented: true`` was necessary and
nowhere near sufficient, and nothing said so.

The naive gate would be the biconditional ``implemented <=> reachable``.  It is
the wrong gate, because reachability has meaningful levels.  ``pbl: off``,
``surface_layer: revised-mm5`` and ``radiation: off`` are implemented and
normally reachable as option-scoped component overrides; Noah-MP is implemented
but expert-template-only; and the analytic clear-sky proxy is implemented but
deliberately outside registry reachability because it is not a WRF scheme.

So the intended relationship is DECLARED, per option, in
``reachability.state``, and this file recomputes every state from the templates
and the routes and fails on a difference.  What that buys over the naive gate:
an option that becomes reachable by accident -- a template edit, a route
widening, a source gaining a template list -- fails here with the state it
actually has, and an option that quietly stops being reachable fails the same
way.  The half of the biconditional that is not negotiable is still enforced:
an option that is not implemented must be declared unreachable, and an
implemented one declared unreachable must name its blocker.

The blockers are not prose.  ``test_the_ruc_blocker_is_still_true`` re-runs the
ingest refusal the RUC row cites, so the declaration cannot outlive the reason
for it.
