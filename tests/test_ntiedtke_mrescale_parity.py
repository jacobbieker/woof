"""cumastrn:996-1016 graded at ``max_ulp == 0`` -- the momentum rescale.

THE ONLY CONSUMER OF ``zcons`` IN THE ENTIRE SCHEME. Every other mass-flux
cap uses ``zcons2`` = 3/(g*dt); this one uses ``zcons`` = 1/(g*dt), one
character away, three times tighter. Getting it wrong makes the momentum
rescale three times too permissive, and the result is finite, plausible and
off by a fixed ratio.

It produces ``zmfuus``/``zmfdus``, and it is THOSE, not ``pmfu``/``pmfd``,
that cududvn consumes -- so cududvn's captured entry state is this block's
exit, and no new output capture was needed.

BOTH OF THIS PHASE'S ERRORS LANDED ON THE MOMENTUM PATH (observed by
review, review): :833-919 misattributed as producing zmfuus/zmfdus, and
the zcons comment wrong about which constants differ -- whose sole consumer
is this block. That path is where the port has no precedent to lean on: GF
and KF both omit momentum coupling and there is no WOOF analogue to
pattern-match against. Hence the extra checks below.

        largest pmfu/zmfmax anywhere in the fixture   0.5076
        the cap binds when that exceeds               1.0

    So zmfs is 1.0 on every one of the 108 columns, zmfuus == pmfu
    identically, and the block is graded ONLY in the sense that its guards
    are evaluated. Substituting zcons2 for zcons -- a 3x looser cap --
    changes nothing, because neither binds.

    WHY THIS IS WORSE THAN THE OTHER NAMED GAPS. zcons has exactly one
    consumer in the entire scheme and it is here; every other mass-flux
    cap uses zcons2, one character away. A wrong choice is finite,
    plausible, and off by a FIXED RATIO -- it would reach f012 looking
    like a physics result. And this is on the momentum path, where the
    port has no precedent: GF and KF both omit momentum coupling, so
    there is no WOOF analogue to be wrong against. Both of this phase's
    errors landed on that path.

    THE GOOD NEWS IS THE FACTOR. At 0.5076 the fixture is short by 2x,
    not by orders of magnitude, so a modestly stronger updraft binds it.
    That makes this a case-table item like the :566 demotion rather than
    an unreachable branch.

    Written toward the gap: this FAILS when a case binds the cap, and
    that failure is the signal to require it -- and to re-enable the
    zcons2-substitution check below, which is the one that proves the
    constant choice is observable at all.
