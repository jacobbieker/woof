"""The install lines in the docs, held against the extras that exist.

2.3.2 shipped a headline feature nobody could reach.  The libraries the
high-resolution terrain path imports lived in a `geog` extra; `[all]`
deliberately excluded it; every published quickstart one-liner omitted
it; and the only mention of it anywhere was a source-checkout line in an
older document.  Nothing was broken in the wheel -- `pip install
'recast-woof[geog]'` worked perfectly.  What was broken was that no documented
command led there.

That failure is invisible to every other kind of test, because each half
is individually correct.  It is only visible by holding the two halves
against each other, which is what this file does, in both directions:

1. Every extra a shipped document tells a reader to install must be an
   extra `pyproject.toml` declares.  A doc naming `recast-woof[geog]` after
   that extra was deleted would be a pasteable command that fails.
2. Every extra the CODE tells a reader to install must be declared AND
   must appear in a shipped document.  A remedy string is not
   documentation: a reader only sees it after they have already hit the
   failure, which is exactly the trap 2.3.2 set.

Direction 2 is the one that would have caught this release's defect
before it shipped, and it caught two live instances when it was written
(`recast-woof[obs]` and `recast-woof[dealias]` were named by code remedies and by no
document at all).

2.3.3 EXTENSION -- the same two directions, applied to the COMMAND LINE.

An extra is one way to make a shipped feature unreachable.  A flag is the
other, and the 2.3.2 reachability audit found the command surface in both
failure modes at once:

* Documents named doors that do not exist.  `TILES.md` told a reader to
  run `woof run CONFIG.toml --case-data ...` and `woof plan`; argparse
  answers the first with `unrecognized arguments` and the second with
  `invalid choice: 'plan'`.  Both were born in a documentation commit and
  never existed in code, so no user could ever have run either.
* Code defined flags no document named.  `--parent-namelist` gated the
  whole stock-WRF-parent route that `woof downscale --help` advertises;
  `--tiles` was the only way to stream the prepared route; `--no-memory-gate`
  was the only escape from the pre-fetch memory gate.  Forty-six flags on
  the `woof` subcommands alone appeared in no document at all.

So three more rules, holding the two halves against each other:

3. Every command a user-facing document tells a reader to RUN must name a
   real door and pass only flags that door defines.
4. Every option every documented door defines must appear in
   `docs/public/CLI-OPTIONS.md`, under that door.
5. Every option `CLI-OPTIONS.md` lists must still exist in that door's
   parser, so the page cannot outlive a removed flag.

Rule 4 is the one that makes the class non-recurring: it is not possible
to add a flag and leave it undocumented, because the page is generated
from the parsers (`python -m tools.build_cli_options_doc`) and this test
fails when the committed page and the parsers disagree.

A sixth rule covers the same defect in configuration: every key
`[case_data]` REQUIRES must be named by a user-facing document.
`output_title` was required at load and appeared in no user-facing page,
so a reader hand-authoring the table from `CONFIGURATION.md` was refused
for a key the documentation had never mentioned.

A seventh rule holds the per-domain override list to the tuple the
loader reads, in both directions.  `CONFIGURATION.md` printed 59 keys
under a sentence that promised 61: `ra_lw_physics` and `ra_sw_physics`
became per-domain when every domain got its own radiation driver, and
the page kept the list it had.  Neither half of that is visible on its
own -- the tuple is correct, the page is internally consistent prose --
and the count in the 2.7.5 release note was walked back to match the
page rather than the code.  So the block is parsed, both differences are
reported, and the stated count is held to the block it introduces.
