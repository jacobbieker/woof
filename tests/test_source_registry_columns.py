"""The registry's DISPLAY-NAME and CREDENTIAL columns.

Two facts a front end used to have to invent for itself:

* the human NAME of a source.  Every consumer showed the raw registry id
  (``gem-gdps``, ``aigefs``, ``hrrr-prs``) because the rows carried no
  name, and any front end that wanted one had to keep a per-model lookup
  -- exactly the table the arbitrary acceptance test forbids.
* what a source needs CONFIGURED before its bytes can be acquired.  The
  rows recorded nothing, so a GUI carried a one-row credential table as
  a hardcoded exception.

Both are columns of the row now, so adding a model stays table work: the
name and the credential facts travel with the row into
``run-plan --sources`` with zero code change on either side of the seam.
