"""The MSLP reduction's optional search window must be BITWISE exact.

``mslp_hpa_from_state(state, window=...)`` exists so a consumer can ask
for sea-level pressure more than once a relocation cadence: the
full-domain reduction pulls four 3-D fields to the host and runs
DCOMPUTESEAPRS over all of them in host float64 (MEASURED 240 ms on a
378x378x49 grid, RTX 5070 Ti, of which 211 ms is host arithmetic), and
cropping to the box the caller actually searches costs 26 ms.

That is only admissible if the crop changes no number.  It does not,
and the reason is structural rather than lucky:

* ``woof.verify.metrics._dcomputeseaprs`` is COLUMN-LOCAL -- every
  operation is elementwise over ``(ny, nx)`` or a ``take_along_axis``
  along k -- so a cropped reduction equals the full one on the crop;
* the nine-point smoother is not, but three passes reach exactly three
  cells, so a three-cell halo reproduces the interior;
* where the halo runs off the domain it is clipped, and there the crop's
  edge IS the domain's edge, so the same row is replicated either way.

Every one of those is a case below, at the interior, at all four edges,
at both corners, at the whole domain, and at a window one cell wide --
plus the degenerate ``phb`` column, which must not be cropped at all.
