"""GPU gate: the NSSL (mp_physics=18) reflectivity route of H_Z(x).

Deliberately its own file, and gpu-marked: ``woof.da.obsop``'s CPU test
module imports no CuPy on purpose, but the NSSL diagnostic is CUDA only --
five ice categories with their own moments make it a scheme port rather
than an adapter over one of the mirrored three, so there is no float64
column mirror and the host path names a refusal instead (that half is
tested in ``test_da_obsop.py``).  What this file pins is that the device
path genuinely dispatches ``mp_physics=18`` to the product's own
``radardd02``, not to Morrison or Thompson.
