"""mp=50's lookup table fails closed, and its parse matches running Fortran.

WHAT THIS MODULE CLAIMS, EXACTLY
--------------------------------
1. The three ways a P3 table can be wrong -- ABSENT, CORRUPT, WRONG VERSION
   -- each produce a distinct refusal that names the breakage it prevents,
   and none of them can be reached by a fallback, a substituted table or a
   zero fill.
2. The arrays :func:`woof.core.p3_tables.load_lookup_table_1` builds from
   the packaged bytes are BYTE-IDENTICAL to the arrays WRF's own
   ``p3_init`` builds from the same bytes.

Claim 2 is an ORACLE claim and it is why this module is separate from
``tests/test_p3_port.py``, whose docstring correctly says it makes none.
The oracle: WRF's ``phys/module_mp_p3.F`` (P3 v4.5.2, sha-256
``716950a3081ec4e338c9a918d26ec80f7ee0e40b3e284283f070423237f6a3c6``,
byte-identical across WRF v4.6.1/4.7.1/4.8.0), compiled with gfortran
15.2.0 unmodified except for an APPENDED dump routine, run as
``p3_init(nCat=1, trplMomI=.false., model='WRF')``, with ``itab`` and
``itabcoll`` written straight out of the module variables.  The digests
that anchor claim 2 live beside the table pin in
:mod:`woof.core.p3_tables` and were measured 2026-08-28.  They were
identical at -O0 and -O2, and identical whether p3_init read the packaged
CRLF file or WRF's own LF ``run/`` copy.

:func:`test_the_fortran_digest_pin_moves_when_one_value_moves` is the
mutation control: it perturbs a single parsed float by one ULP and
requires the digest to move, so a green claim 2 cannot mean "the digest
was computed over something that ignores the table".
