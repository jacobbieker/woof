"""Does the VRAM inventory name every array the physics driver allocates?

``preflight.physics_array_shapes`` is the physics half of every resident,
tile and lifecycle estimate, and it is a hand-kept list beside the
allocations it prices.  With the MYJ pair selected (``bl_pbl_physics = 2``,
``sf_sfclay_physics = 2``) it named neither TKE_MYJ/EL_MYJ nor 17 of the
Eta layer's surface planes, while ``initialize_physics`` allocated all 19:
4*C*(2*nz + 17) = 932,184,064 bytes (0.868 GiB) at 1792x1024x55 that no
estimate saw, so a run admitted with less spare than that allocated past
its estimate.

The census closes the class, not the instance.  For every surface layer,
PBL and land-surface selector the config door admits, at both PBL
cadences, ``tests/physics_allocation_census.py`` builds the real driver on
a counting NumPy stand-in for cupy in a child interpreter (no card, no
cupy needed) and reports every buffer the construction left on it.  Each
one must be in the inventory under the same name, with the same shape and
four bytes a value.  The next field a scheme adds without pricing fails
here instead of in a run.
