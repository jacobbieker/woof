"""``dt`` in the step log: present under an adaptive clock, absent under a fixed one.

WHY IT IS CONDITIONAL.  Under a fixed step the timestep is a constant
sitting in the experiment config, so putting it on every step record
would be noise -- and it would move EVERY run's stream to v4, making a
v3-only consumer refuse streams whose shape it understands perfectly.
Under an adaptive step it is the run's most diagnostic quantity and it is
otherwise unrecoverable: differencing ``model_seconds`` is the only other
route, and ``StepLog.domain_step`` already documents why that derivation
is wrong for a delayed-start nest.

So the gate is the run's configuration, and the two properties that
matter are opposite ones: a fixed run must emit EXACTLY what it emitted
before this feature existed, and an adaptive run must emit the field AND
declare the schema that warns a consumer about it.
