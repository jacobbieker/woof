"""A recorded PID names one process, and one card is claimed by one launcher, across processes too.

The defects this file holds shut:

- A record's PID of ``true``, ``1.5``, ``NaN`` or a number past 32 bits
  was read as a process number: ``true`` became 1 (the system's first
  process), and Windows cut a large number to 32 bits, naming some other
  process that a stop could then reach.
- Two launchers in two processes checked the card, spawned and recorded
  the holder apart, and both ran on the card; the claim is one step under
  an operating-system lock, which this holds across real processes.
