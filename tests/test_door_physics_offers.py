"""What each front door OFFERS, and whether its own route can run it.

Four defects sat behind one question nothing asked: does a suite a door
lists survive the route that door drives?  The nowcast door offered every
suite the single-domain runner resolves, the configuration door it calls
first offered a shorter list, and the namelist that door writes could not
be read back as the configuration beside it for three separate reasons --
an unimplemented cumulus selector, an ArWen-only boundary-layer selector,
and a turbulence row the renderer never authored.  A fourth suite class
ran on the route that reads the TOML and was refused on the route that
reads the namelist, because the declaration that admits it has no
namelist spelling.

Every test here is about the offer, not about a scheme: they enumerate
the offered set and hold the whole set to one rule, so a suite registered
tomorrow is covered by arithmetic rather than by an edit.
