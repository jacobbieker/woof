"""The positive-definite fix-up a parent-SINT birth needs, and its limit.

``parent_only_init`` fills a newborn nest by interpolating its parent.
Interpolation is a weighted sum of float32 donors, so a field that is
non-negative everywhere in the parent can land a few units in the last
place BELOW zero in the child.  The health gate holds number
concentrations to ``>= 0`` and refuses the leg, which is how a measured
``nr`` of ``-2**-31`` -- one part in ten billion of a single particle
per kilogram -- stopped a run at the instant its nest was born.

The fix-up is bounded on purpose.  A clamp with no ceiling would absorb
a genuinely broken interpolation, which is the one thing the health gate
exists to catch, so the tests below pin BOTH directions: a
rounding-scale undershoot is set to zero and counted, and anything
larger is left exactly where it is for the gate to refuse.
