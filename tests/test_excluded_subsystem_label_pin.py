"""The display-label allowance, tested where no checkout is needed.

``tests/test_excluded_subsystem_absent.py`` skips every test it holds when
there is no git checkout, because its scans read ``git ls-files`` and the
branch history.  This one test reads neither: it asks the masking rule
about three literal lines.  Kept there, it skipped on every run from a
release snapshot, so the pin that keeps the display-label allowance
narrow went unchecked exactly where the snapshot ships.  The helpers are
imported, not copied, so the rule tested is the rule the scans apply.
