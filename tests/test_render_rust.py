"""``woof render --engine rust`` and ``--pair`` -- CPU-only tests.

The rust-engine tests run against the real vendored renderer binary
(``tools/rustwx``) and skip with a stated reason when it is not built; nothing here
mocks the engine.  The fixture wrfout is written by the project's own
``WrfoutWriter`` with the production global-attribute profile
(``wrf_global_attrs``: Lambert projection, START_DATE, domain
topology), because that is what ``woof run`` writes and what the rust
importer's fail-closed preflight requires.  Its second frame is on the
half hour -- every rust-engine test doubles as the exact-time
(sub-hourly) regression test that the source renderer refused.

PNG dimensions are read from the IHDR chunk directly so the assertions
add no image-library dependency.
