"""A preparation's refusal reaches a run's failure notice as its own sentences.

The preparation door prints a refusal and exits 78; the chain that ran it
saw only the status, so a scratch disk too small for the frame stream
reached ``woof gui``'s failure notice, and the events every front end
reads, as "prepare failed (exit 78)." with no remedy.  And where the words
did arrive, the page took every machine path out of them, the scratch
folder the remedy is about included.
