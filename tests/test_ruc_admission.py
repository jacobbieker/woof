"""Whether a user can select RUC, and what had to be true first.

``tests/test_ruc_runtime.py`` proves RUC forecasts, restarts and writes output.
None of that made it selectable, and this file is the difference.  It runs on
the HOST: it imports no cupy, so ``tests/conftest.py`` does not auto-mark it
``gpu`` and it answers the admission question on a machine with no card --
which is the point, because the answer is about wiring and arithmetic rather
than about a device.

Two independent blockers held the door shut, each bound to code rather than to
prose, and **both are now closed**:

1. **The ingest was not wired.**  ``woof/ingest/ruc_soil.py`` is
   ``init_soil_depth_3`` + ``init_soil_3_real`` at max_ulp 0 against
   ``woof/data/ruc/oracle/soil_ingest.csv``, and it had ZERO importers inside
   the package: every initializer called ``preprocess_noah_soil`` and received
   a ``NoahSoilState`` whose four-layer shape, Noah SH2O partition and sea-ice
   column are Noah's.  ``preprocess_land_surface_soil`` is now that seam, all
   seven initializers call it, and it is fail-closed on the
   ``sf_surface_physics`` selector rather than on the array shape.

2. **The per-column cost was flat.**  ``ruc_land_surface_step`` ran a Python
   ``for i in range(ncolumn)`` loop over float32 scalars, so a land-surface
   call cost the same per column at 48 columns and at 24,576 -- which made the
   whole cost of a nest its width, and d04 of the production four-domain case
   is 360,000 columns, i.e. ten minutes for ONE call.  The column now runs on
   the card: 16.8 wall seconds per simulated minute at that width snow-free
   and 65.7 fully snow-covered, measured at 360,000 columns rather than
   extrapolated from a narrow grid.

The host driver is still here and is still measured flat, because it is the
REFERENCE the oracle fixtures compare against WRF and the device path is
gated against it at max_ulp 0.  What changed is which one a forecast runs.

RUC still has no column-count rail in ``woof/physics_compat.py`` and that is
now a decision rather than a gap: Noah-MP has one because its call cannot
finish, and :func:`test_the_width_rail_covers_noahmp_and_not_ruc` records both
halves.

Every gate here carries its own control, because a gate nobody has seen fail
is not evidence: the import scan is shown finding the importers of a module
that IS wired, the flatness statistic is shown rejecting work that is not
per-column, and the width rail is shown firing for the scheme that has one.

    ``--physics-profile`` asserts a validated suite and there is no
    six-level verification evidence to assert.  What it has instead is the
    hash-bound experiment config the prepared runner already takes, which
    this test walks end to end: write the TOML, load it, and check the
    engine resolves the geometry the file asked for.

    The route gate is checked in the same breath, because "the config loads"
    and "the runner will accept it" are different claims and only the second
    one is a door.
