"""A downscaled child keeps one checkpoint set and prices its disk first.

The breakage: an 11 hour 250 m child kept every hourly checkpoint it wrote
(11 sets of 2.59 GB, 28.5 GB beside its history) and nothing projected the
disk it would take before it started, so a long child could fill its disk
partway through.  The forecast route has kept one set by default since
run-plan learned ``keep_checkpoints``; the downscale route now keeps one
set the same way, writing the new set before the old one goes, and the
plan review carries the disk projection and refuses a child the free space
cannot hold before the child starts.
