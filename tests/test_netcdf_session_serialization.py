"""One netCDF4/HDF5 session at a time, across the WHOLE process.

THE BUG THIS PINS.  netCDF4 releases the GIL around HDF5 calls and the
shipped HDF5 library is not thread-safe, so two Python threads inside it
at once is a crash rather than a race that merely produces wrong numbers.
``woof.io.wrfout`` had known this since its async writer landed and held
a lock for it -- a lock private to that module, which therefore protected
the writer against itself and against nothing else.

MEASURED: a two-domain run with a relocating 1 km child died with SIGSEGV
or SIGBUS immediately after ``wrfout_d01_..._12_40_00`` was written, in 3
of 8 full runs, always at the 2400 s relocation, leaving nine frames of
fourteen on disk.  ``faulthandler`` on the SIGBUS put the main thread in
``woof/core/rrtmgp.py`` opening ``rfmip-clear-sky-inputs.nc`` for the
RRTMGP state being rebuilt for the moved child, while a
``gpuwm-wrfout-*`` writer thread sat in ``validate_wrfout_file``
reopening the tape it had just published.  It happened on the release
line and on the lane, so it is neither adaptive- nor relocation-specific:
any netCDF4 read that lands beside a publish can do it.
