"""Refusal-design findings from the 2026-08-18 persona walks: R1, N14, N11.

Each test drives the same front door the walk drove and pins the
sentence that door owes.  The Refusals law is the spec: a refusal names
the concrete breakage it prevents AND prints a remedy the user can
type; a nonzero exit with neither is a defect row.

* R1  -- ``woof check`` on a wizard-emitted config with no declared
         budget and no measurable card exited 2 after three
         "not measured" lines, with no sentence saying why or what to
         type next (replay walk C, step 1).
* N14 -- the wizard refused arithmetic it derived itself: ``--root-dx
         9`` chooses dt = 45 s and the profile's cudt = 300 s, then the
         loader refuses 300/45 = 20/3.  The user supplied neither
         number, so the wizard adjusts its own derivation and says so.
* N11 -- ``woof fetch --source gfs`` left a pile (three grib2 + tsv +
         manifest) instead of the four-file front door DATA.md promises,
         and the handoff needed a second ``--author-front-door-manifest``
         call.  The fetch now writes the same four files the table
         routes write, and the prep door authors the digest binding
         itself when ``--source-manifest`` is omitted.

R2 (the gfs-direct eta-ladder refusal with no remedy) lives in
``tests/test_gfs_direct.py`` beside the vertical-contract suite, and
N18 (the run-folder line on a refused real ``woof go``) lives in
``tests/test_go_chain.py`` beside the gate-ordering suite.
