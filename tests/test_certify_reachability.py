"""A validator nobody calls is the same defect wherever it lives.

Three functions under ``woof/certify/`` were written, documented, exported
and tested -- and called by nothing.  ``woof certify`` therefore printed
PASS over NVRTC drift and over an empty kernel manifest, because the code
that would have caught both was unreachable from the command.  A test suite
that exercises a validator directly does not notice: the function passes its
own tests forever while the product never runs it.

So this module does not ask "is it tested".  It asks **"is it reachable from
the front door"** -- from ``woof certify`` / ``woof dual-run`` and from the
capsule-emission path -- by walking the package's own call graph.

The instrument is validated in both directions against a synthetic package
whose answers are known, because a reachability checker that silently reports
"all reachable" is exactly the failure it is meant to catch.
