"""``[tiles]`` reaches the offline child, from the TOML to the stepper.

THE DEFECT THIS PINS.  The experiment TOML the multi-domain front doors
read has accepted ``[tiles]`` since 2.2.0.  The RunConfig TOML -- the
schema ``woof downscale`` hands to the standalone child -- refused the
block outright as an unknown table, so the one route whose domain is most
likely to outgrow the card it is run on was the one route that could not
ask to stream.  Measured at the 2.2.1 cut: a ``[tiles] mode = 'on'``
appended to a derived child config died in ``load_config`` before any
parent frame was opened.

CPU-side only, deliberately.  The streamed integration itself is proven by
``tilestream/test_join.py`` (bit-exact against the resident arm) and by
the 2.2.2 planner-driven GPU leg; what was missing was never the
transport, it was the wiring, and wiring is what these assert.
