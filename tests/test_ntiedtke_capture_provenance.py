"""Every graded slice declares where its entry state was captured.

WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is the port's own class-1 rule aimed at a process
rule (argued by review).

Eight instances of one mistake: sourcing a slice's entry state from a
NEIGHBOURING capture on the reasoning that nothing between touches it.
Instances five, six, seven and eight are the *same specific decision*, and
the rate is not declining:

===  ===========================================================  ==========
 5   cuascn's ktype fed to the closure; :566-568 flips it          2 rounds
 6   pmfude_rate from cuascn's exit; :746-819 rescales it          1.26x low
 7   the downdraft arrays from the closure's PRE-state; the
     closure's own :726-740 rescales them                         5/14 wrong
 8   "cuinin sets puu/pvu and nothing between touches them";
     :927-995 rewrites them -- 1,926 of 5,292 slots differ         claim only
===  ===========================================================  ==========

``docs/ntiedtke/STANDING-RULES.md`` was given the inverted default -- CAPTURE
FIRST -- after instance six. Instance seven happened **two commits later**,
committed by the person who wrote the rule, having just explained it. So the
rule is a receipt: recorded, and nothing checks it.

THE RULE THIS GATE ENFORCES: **capture at the boundary, or measure the gap
inert. Never reason.**

Instance 8 is the one that shows why the *measurement* is the essential
half. Its captured values were RIGHT -- taken at cududvn's own call site --
and only the explanation was wrong. Reasoning produced a false statement
that a future reader would have used, while the capture quietly protected
the arithmetic.

#:
#: Equal is the common case and passes silently. Unequal requires an entry
#: in EXEMPTIONS carrying a MEASUREMENT, not an argument.
#:
#: A SLICE MAY DECLARE SEVERAL CAPTURE LINES.  The single-tuple form below
#: assumed one entry state per slice, which held for every slice so far and
#: does NOT hold for cu_ntiedtke_post_run: a tendency is a difference, so it
#: reads the state cu_ntiedtke_run left AND the reference state it
#: differences against, from two different points.  A gate that silently
#: recorded only the first of two provenances would pass while leaving the
#: second exactly as unguarded as the eight instances were (caught before it
#: mattered, by review).  So a value may be a tuple of pairs, and EVERY
#: pair is checked -- see _pairs().
#: EVERY ROW NAMES ITS FILE.  It did not, for one commit: the table was
#: cu_ntiedtke.F90 line numbers with a hand-maintained set of exceptions,
#: and post_run -- the first foreign row -- landed at :501-502, INSIDE
#: cumastrn's :460-1085. The exception set was correct only because someone
#: remembered to write it, and a hand-maintained set is the thing that has
#: failed repeatedly here (review).
#:
