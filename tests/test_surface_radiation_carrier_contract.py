"""The surface-radiation carrier contract, checked in both directions.

Every test here is in one of two classes, and the class is stated so a
reader can tell what a green run proves:

RECEIPT-IMPLIES-CONSUMPTION -- the contract's record and what the LSM
actually eats are the same object.  A test that only read the record
would pass on a tree where the check was never wired into the consumer
seam, which is the failure mode that let three of these holes ship.

RED-ON-REVERT -- each test names the exact pre-contract behaviour it
would pass under, so a revert of the fix turns it red rather than
leaving it green on a different code path.  The three named holes are
RUC's GSW in daylight, Noah's SWDOWN under radiation-off, and Noah-MP's
COSZEN frozen at its first minute.

These are CPU-side contract tests: they exercise the record, the matrix,
the policy and the refusal text, none of which touch a GPU.  The seam
that calls the check from PhysicsDriver.compute is covered by the driver
suites that run a step.
