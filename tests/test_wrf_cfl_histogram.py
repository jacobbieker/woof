"""``w_cfl_stat``'s vert_cfl histogram, against a CPU reference.

WHY THIS EXISTS.  ``out[0]`` is a maximum -- an order statistic that one
cell decides.  A controller reading it cannot tell "the flow got faster
everywhere" from "one column is having a moment", and upstream's +5%
per-step growth clamp (adapt_timestep_em.F:174) is a rate limiter
standing in for the distribution nobody could afford to measure.  The
histogram measures it.  These gates pin that the bins mean what the host
thinks they mean, because nothing type-checks a .cu against a .py.

The construction below pins ``m = 1``, ``rdnw = 1`` and ``dt = 1`` so
that ``vert_cfl == |ww|`` exactly, which makes the expected histogram
something numpy can state independently rather than a re-derivation of
the kernel's own arithmetic.
