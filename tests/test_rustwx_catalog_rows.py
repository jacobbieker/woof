"""The catalog row contract: a machine code and a verdict.

Every case here stubs the renderer's output rather than running one, which
is what lets them run on a box with no build (``find_renderer()`` is None
here and every ``@needs_renderer`` case in ``tests/test_render_rust.py``
skips).  The rows they feed are the rows the Rust emitter prints; the
parity between the two is pinned separately by
