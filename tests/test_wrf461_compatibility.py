    verdict count scaled by exactly 6/5 is not an assumption used to derive
    them -- the numbers below were read off the enlarged matrix, and the
    clean ratio is the EVIDENCE that microphysics is an independent axis of
    the WRF v4.6.1 authority table: no cell's verdict depends on which
    microphysics scheme it names, which is exactly what the six per-cell
    citations say (the mp citation is informational, and only the
    PBL/surface-layer pair can be FATAL).  A count that had not scaled by
    6/5 would have meant mp=28 changed a verdict somewhere, and that would
    need a WRF citation, not a pin update.

    reconfigured +96 (the no-LSM slice) and not-expressible +96 (the
