"""The ARW dycore's pure-advective theta/qv forcing pair (RTHFTEN/RQVFTEN).

THE BREAKAGE THIS FILE PREVENTS, in three parts.

1.  **The lane was empty.**  WRF's GFDRV builds its forced states ``tn``/
    ``qo`` from four forcing inputs; ``tests/test_gf_pbl_forcing_lanes.py``
    closed the boundary-layer pair for every PBL scheme, and the MPAS
    driver exports the advective pair, but nothing in the ARW dycore
    assigned ``gf_rthdynten``/``gf_rqvdynten`` -- so a real ARW Grell-
    Freitas forecast fed the scheme hard zeros for RTHFTEN/RQVFTEN while
    WRF fed it the step's advection.  The cells below run the REAL dycore
    step and assert the lanes arrive non-zero, finite, and bound to the
    driver the cumulus adapter reads.

2.  **The double-count trap.**  ``module_cumulus_driver.F:867`` pre-folds
    ``RTHRATEN + RTHBLTEN`` into ``RTHFTEN`` for ``G3SCHEME`` and
    ``NTIEDTKESCHEME`` and deliberately NOT for ``GFSCHEME``; GF sums the
    three lanes itself (``gf.cu:4428``).  An export taken one line later in
    ``dycore.step`` -- after ``physics_tendencies.add_to_slow`` or after
    ``add_h_diabatic_tendency`` -- would hand GF the radiative, boundary-
    layer and latent heating a second time.  The zero-wind cell below is
    the instrument: pure advection is exactly zero there, so ANY contamination
    from the physics or h_diabatic slots shows up as a non-zero export while
    those slots are loudly non-zero.

3.  **The coupling.**  ``rth_t`` is WRF-coupled and carries an extra
    ``1/msfty``; GF wants an uncoupled K s-1 rate, exactly what
    ``h_diabatic`` is.  The round-trip cell pins the export as the precise
    inverse of ``dycore.add_h_diabatic_tendency`` including the map-factor
    branch, so a run over real terrain cannot silently feed GF a
    mass-coupled number that merely looks like a rate.
