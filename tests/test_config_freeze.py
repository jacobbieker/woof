"""Phase-5 Task 1 byte-identity freeze pins (architecture section A).

``woof/config.py`` carries the Phase-5 fields plus WRF-default
``top_lid = False`` and attribution-only ``moist_cq = True``;
``load_config()`` and the legacy
``[grid]``/``[dynamics]``/``[run]`` tables are untouched.  These pins
prove the guarantee: every existing legacy TOML under ``configs/`` and
every frozen-case constructed RunConfig re-resolves IDENTICALLY --
``dataclasses.asdict`` compared field-for-field against the golden
snapshot captured from the pre-change code plus explicitly reviewed new
configuration fields (``tests/data/config_freeze_golden.json``).

Freeze discipline: a legacy TOML added to ``configs/`` without a golden
entry FAILS here -- new files are pinned consciously, never implicitly.
Experiment-shaped TOMLs ([experiment]/[[domain]]) are exercised by
tests/test_experiment.py instead.
