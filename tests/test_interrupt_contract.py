"""Ctrl-C has one bounded contract, and it is the same everywhere.

The fleet's hostile-input node filed ``woof go`` **ignores SIGINT**: a
run signalled mid-stage went on to write three frames, 159 product
images and a certification capsule, while SIGTERM and SIGKILL both
stopped it.  Measuring the signal disposition on a 5080 node reproduced
the mechanism exactly and it is not in this package: a shell that starts
a job in the BACKGROUND masks SIGINT for it (POSIX job control), and
CPython declines to install its own handler over an inherited
``SIG_IGN``, so no ``KeyboardInterrupt`` is ever raised.

    foreground        SIGINT handler at startup: default_int_handler
    `... &`           SIGINT handler at startup: 1   (SIG_IGN)
    `nohup ... &`     SIGINT handler at startup: 1   (SIG_IGN)

That leaves two real gaps, and this file is the bar under both:

* the masked case was *silent* -- so it is named, once, in a warning;
* the unmasked case had no contract at all -- an interrupt escaped as a
  ``KeyboardInterrupt`` traceback -- so it now returns 130, names the
  stage, and signals nothing.

The contract matches the multi-GPU orchestration lane verbatim: Ctrl-C
returns 130 and does not kill children or unrelated processes;
unobserved child pids are only printed.
