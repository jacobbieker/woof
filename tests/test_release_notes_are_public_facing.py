"""The top CHANGELOG section is a release note, not a development log.

1.4.1 shipped 5,910 words of release notes carrying internal development state:
branch names, an internal `Verdict: BLOCKED`, a roadmap target for the next
version, and the rebase status of unshipped work. For scale, 1.2.3 shipped 94
words, 1.3.1 shipped 853 and 1.3.0 shipped 1,252. None of it was secret, but
none of it was a user's business either, and a reader cannot tell a shipped
capability from a branch name.

Two failure modes, and they are different in kind:

* **Leaking internal state** is unambiguous -- a branch prefix or an internal
  verdict either appears or it does not -- so it is a hard failure.
* **Length** is a judgement call, so the bound here is set where no reasonable
  release note lands rather than at what a good one looks like. It exists to
  catch a development log pasted wholesale, not to referee prose.

Only the NEWEST section is checked. History is history: earlier entries are not
rewritten to satisfy a rule written after they shipped.
