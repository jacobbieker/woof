"""The ``recast-woof-data`` companion: same bytes, same version, named refusals.

One repository, two distributions.  ``woof`` measured 103.62 MiB against
PyPI's 100 MiB per-file cap once the Rust bridges were staged into it, and
the two pure-data directories below were 64.21 MiB of that, so they ship in
``recast-woof-data`` and ``woof`` pins it ``==``.

What this file gates, and the breakage each one prevents:

* **Byte identity.**  A packaging move that quietly re-encoded, truncated or
  substituted a table would change every radiation and microphysics answer
  while every other test still passed -- physics reads what it is handed.
  So a member of each moved tree is hashed THROUGH the resolver against a
  recorded digest, which also proves the resolver reaches the real files
  rather than an empty directory.
* **Version lockstep.**  The version string is restated in three places
  that pip and setuptools each read separately.  If they drift, `pip
  install woof` resolves to a companion that was never built with it, and
  the failure is numeric rather than loud.
* **The refusals.**  A missing or skewed companion must say so by name and
  end in the pip line that fixes it.  A bare ``FileNotFoundError`` deep in a
  NetCDF open names nothing.
* **The front doors.**  The refusal has to reach a READER, which means
  ``woof check`` and ``woof domain`` print it as a sentence at a nonzero
  exit with no traceback -- not a twenty-frame relay ending in the same
  words.  Measured in a real subprocess against an install-shaped tree,
  because that is the only shape where the checkout fallback is absent.

    The first public-tree CI run produced it: a repository-wide ``*.nc``
    gitignore rule swallowed every ``data/rrtmgp/*.nc`` when the release
    snapshot was ``git add``-ed, so the companion wheel built from that
    checkout was importable, versioned correctly, carried a ``data/``
    directory -- and had no k-distributions in it.  ``woof domain`` died
    with a bare ``FileNotFoundError`` out of a NetCDF open deep in the
    preflight's radiation sizing: a traceback that names no distribution
    and no remedy, which is exactly the shape the module docstring above
    promises cannot happen.

    The missing-companion and decoy tests cannot catch it: both remove or
    replace the whole package, and ``companion_root()``'s directory-level
    check passes an incomplete tree.  So the state is arranged exactly --
    a real companion beside the install with ONE member absent -- and the
