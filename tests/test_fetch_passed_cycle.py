"""A cycle the server has let go is refused as gone, never as "not published yet".

The breakage these guard: ``woof fetch --source icon-global --cycle
2026-09-27T00`` a day and a half later, and ``--source icon-eu --cycle
2026-09-27T06`` a day later, were refused with "cycle ... is not
published through f003 yet; the newest complete ... cycle covering f003
is 2026-09-28T06Z".  Both cycles are OLDER than that newest one: DWD's
open-data door keeps each cycle hour's newest run for about a day and
has no archive behind it, so the user was told to wait for a cycle that
would never appear.

Only the network is replaced, by a stand-in listing of a rolling door
that holds each cycle hour's newest published run.  The probe URLs, the
endpoint ladder, the retention facts and the latest-cycle resolver are
the production ones.
