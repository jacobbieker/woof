"""The two refusals, both directions, plus the product stamp.

A refusal is only as good as the cases it does NOT fire on.  The whole
risk in this program is a gate that trips on an ordinary
``pip install recast-woof`` -- a person whose install is perfectly correct,
told it is broken, with a remedy that does not apply to them.  That is
strictly worse than the defect being guarded, so every test here comes
in a pair: the shape that must refuse, and the shape that must pass in
silence.

Install shapes are built out of REAL files, reusing
``tests/test_provenance``'s builders rather than a second set: a real
package directory, a real ``.dist-info`` read by a real
``PathDistribution``, a real ``git init``.  The renderer bridges are
real files too, carrying real ``GPUWM_BRIDGE_SOURCE_REV=<40 hex>``
byte stamps of the kind ``build.rs`` injects, read back by the same
``woof.bridge_assets.embedded_source_revisions`` the release cut uses.

Each refusal is mutually falsifying by construction: a gate that always
returned ``None`` would fail every ``_refuses`` test, and one that
always refused would fail every ``_is_silent`` test.  Two further tests
hold everything fixed and flip exactly ONE fact -- the bridge's stamp,
and the tree's declared version -- and require the verdict to move,
because "the paths differ" is a weak discriminator and this project has
been burned by instruments that were right for the wrong reason.
