"""Noah-MP knobs that reach no woof code are carried, not refused.

``woof.config.NOAHMP_OPTION_IDENTITY_EVIDENCE`` pins every Noah-MP
option to one value and gives the evidence for each.  Three of its rows
read "declared only", and they mean something different from the rest:
the knob has NO consumer at any value.  ``opt_pedo`` selects a
pedotransfer branch that ``opt_soil=1`` makes unreachable;
``noahmp_output`` and ``noahmp_acc_dt`` drive WRF's ``module_diag_misc``
accumulator block, which woof has no counterpart to.  Nothing reads
them, so no value of them can make a run wrong.

Refusing one therefore named no breakage: the reason in the table is
"pinned to keep it that way", which is about tidiness.  They are
admitted with one warning saying the knob reaches nothing -- the fact a
user setting it actually needs -- while the rows whose other value
selects code that was never transcribed stay refused, because that code
is MISSING and substituting a nearby branch for it is how a run becomes
silently wrong.

Both doors reach that verdict from the same table: the run door
(``validate_run_config``) and the namelist importer.
