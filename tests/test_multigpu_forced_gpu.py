"""The FORCED decomposition rung, as a pytest door onto the real gate.

One test, deliberately: ``tilestream.multigpu.gate_forced`` is the verdict
machine (specified case, 1/2/4 ranks vs the resident digest, poison-seam and
scaled-edge controls) and this file only opens the door the battery walks
through.  The full-size rung stays reachable as
``python -m tilestream.multigpu forced``.
