"""CLI-polish findings from the 2.5.0 UX persona walks.

Seven measured frictions, each reproduced here the way the walk met it
-- through the real front door wherever the finding IS front-door
behaviour -- before it was fixed:

* **N9** -- ``woof setup`` spent 15.5 s of its 16.2 s in unbroken
  silence while 315 MiB of Thompson tables downloaded, which is
  indistinguishable from a hang.  The table download now counts its
  bytes on stderr, and the setup wrapper captures stdout only, so the
  counter reaches the reader through it.
* **N10** -- fetch feedback was inverted: the large table route printed
  nothing at all between its opening line and its manifest, while the
  small GFS route's per-file lines block-buffered through a pipe (9.1 s
  of 9.8 silent in a log).  The route now names each object as it lands
  and counts bytes while they move, and every front door line-buffers
  its stdout so a log streams.
* **N13** -- ``prep-command.txt`` is documented "runnable as written"
  and exited 78 on the second paste: authoring refused to overwrite
  ``inputs.json`` and named no remedy.  Re-authoring byte-identical
  content is now idempotent; differing content still refuses, and the
  refusal prints a line the reader can type.
* **N15** -- the upgrade was invisible: doctor's report is shape
  identical to 2.4.1 and ``woof run --help`` was byte-identical.
  Doctor now names what changed when the installed version differs from
  the version its last run here recorded, and ``run --help`` points at
  the unbundled stages and the run-folder/render layouts.
* **N16 residue** -- the ahead-of-PyPI sentence landed, and said the
  index's version twice in one sentence.
* **N17** -- ``woof doctor --source`` accepted era5/gfs/hrrr only,
  three of the registry's sources, and refused ``hrrr-prs`` -- which is
  the route the walk actually used.  The choices are the registry's now.
* **N24** -- ``woof --version`` was an argparse usage error; render's
  layout line mixed ``\\`` and ``/``; three consecutive no-information
  "pip extra aliases" lines read as three findings.
