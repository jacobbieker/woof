"""A forecast waiting at a seam is timed by its wait, not by the step bound.

The breakage (A136 L4): a chained forecast that catches up with its
preparation waits at a seam for the next boundary interval.  The wait
refreshed only ``progress.json``, and the watchdog `woof go` runs beside
the forecast reads ``run-progress.json``, so a wait longer than
max(3 x p99 step, 120 s) was stopped as "forecast stalled" while the
source lead it waited for was still on schedule.  Every rolling source
posts slower than the model runs, so such waits are the normal state of a
run that starts as its source posts.

Now the wait publishes ``waiting:source`` or ``waiting:preparation`` with
its record on the heartbeat, and the watchdog bounds a source wait by the
lead's ``late_at`` + 120 s and a preparation wait by the producer silence
limit.  The cause comes from the producer heartbeat, and a lead later than
its budget ends the run by name with exit 75.
