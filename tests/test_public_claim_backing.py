"""Every public t=0 parity claim is backed by a receipt, or it is pending.

The external review's finding was not that a number was wrong.  It was
that six published sentences state a t=0 result whose breadth nothing in
the tree measures: the matched-run comparator scores eight carriers, and
the sentences generalize from them to the initial state.  A doc fix alone
would just move the unbacked sentence somewhere else, so the durable
artifact is this guard -- it reads the claim, resolves the receipt the
claim links, and compares the breadth the sentence asserts against the
``covered_groups`` the receipt measured.

The guard is ENFORCED: there is no carried list any more.  Every audited
site was rewritten against the committed receipt, so any finding at all in
the published set fails the build.  The published set is ``docs/public``
AND the repository root, because the prediction above came true: rooted at
``docs/public`` alone, this gate was green through a release in which
``README.md``'s verification table carried the retired sentence over a
receipt whose verdict is FAIL.  See :func:`published_markdown`.

Four rules bite.  Three read the claim -- is it linked to a receipt, does
it infer the whole state from one carrier group, is it broader than the
receipt's ``covered_groups``.  The fourth reads the receipt back: a block
that cites a receipt must state that receipt's verdict.  Without it a
sentence could assert parity while linking a receipt that says FAIL, and
every other rule would pass it, because breadth and backing say nothing
about which way the measurement came out.

The essential tests in this file are the negative controls: the guard
must REJECT a fixture containing the retired surface-to-full-state
sentence, must REJECT that same sentence when it is quoted rather than
written plainly -- and without letting a neighbouring quoted paragraph's
receipt back it -- and must REJECT a fixture that cites a failing receipt
without saying so.  A guard that only ever passes is not evidence of
anything.
