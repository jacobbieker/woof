"""A shipped config may not carry an acknowledgement token silently.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.

An acknowledgement lifts a guard.  ``[experiment].acknowledgements`` is
the config-side declaration channel
(:mod:`woof.physics_compat`), and by design a token there turns a
refusal into a run.  That is correct for a declared experiment and
catastrophic as a default, and the difference between the two is
entirely a matter of whether anybody wrote down WHY.

They did not.  ``asymmetric-radiation-nocturnal-window-v1`` shipped in
1.7.1 and by 1.8.7 ten shipped configs carried it, including
``configs/era5_wrf_direct_proof.toml`` and
``configs/gfs_wrf_direct_proof.toml`` -- the two files a new ERA5 or GFS
user copies first.  Both ran ``ra_lw_physics = 0`` with
``ra_sw_physics = 1``.  Copying one inherited the token, and the token
was checked BEFORE any physics was inspected, so the copy walked past
the guard into a forecast whose downward longwave was a frozen
300 W m-2.  Nothing in any of those files said what the declaration was
for; the comment above the token was the same four boilerplate lines in
every one of them, pasted along with the token.

So: a token is admissible, and an UNJUSTIFIED token is not.  Every
acknowledgement in every shipped config must be answered, in the same
file, by a line of the form

    # JUSTIFY <token>: <reason>

with a reason of real length.  That is a deliberately annoying thing to
type, which is the point -- it is the smallest edit that cannot be made
by copy-paste without noticing, and a reader who opens the file learns
why the guard is off before they learn that it is off.

WHAT THIS BAR IS, stated plainly so nobody mistakes it for more.  The
bar is PROCEDURAL: presence and length, not content.  200 characters of
lorem ipsum under a ``# JUSTIFY`` header pass it, and the block may sit
anywhere in the file (the domain wizard's own emissions put it in the
header comment, above the ``[experiment]`` table).  A test cannot judge
whether a reason is a reason; a REVIEWER can, and the convention's job
is to guarantee the reviewer a written claim to judge, attributable to
whoever typed it.  Nor does the convention stop propagation by itself:
copying a config carries the token AND its justification prose forward
verbatim.  What protects a copy is the pair of load guards -- a copy
that keeps the token keeps a false-but-visible claim a reviewer can
catch; a copy that drops it refuses to load.  The defect the 1.8.7
configs shipped -- proof descriptors users copy FIRST carrying a
standing bypass -- is closed by those files now computing real
radiation, not by this convention.

ONE EXEMPTION: BYTE-FROZEN RECORDS (1.8.8 lead ruling).  A config under
``configs/frozen/`` that ``FROZEN_RECORDS`` pins by sha256 is a record of
a committed run, not a menu item -- a published receipt names it by that
digest, so editing it to satisfy a rule written after it was frozen
would break the pin and leave the receipt naming bytes that no longer
exist.  Those files are skipped, their live siblings carry the rules in
their place, and the exemption is on BYTES rather than on the directory
name: an unpinned file under ``configs/frozen/``, or a pinned one whose
bytes moved, is governed like any other shipped config.  See
:func:`_is_frozen_record` and the two control tests below.

The three records under ``configs/frozen/`` have since been re-pinned,
for the one reason a record may move: at their old bytes they no longer
LOADED, the constant-downward-longwave guard refusing the pairing they
run.  Each gained that declaration in the JUSTIFY convention and its pin
followed, so today they satisfy this convention rather than needing the
exemption from it.  The exemption stands unchanged all the same: what
exempts a record is its pin, not its compliance, and the next rule
written after a record is frozen will need it exactly as this one did.

The test is a governance test, not a physics test: it reads files and
never runs anything.
