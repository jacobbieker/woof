# tests/test_wrfout_initial_condition_provenance.py
"""The wrfout says what its initial condition WAS, not only when it began.

v1.4.0 computed the initial-condition provenance correctly and wrote it to
``run/report.json`` only.  The wrfout -- the durable artifact, the one that
outlives the run directory and the one every downstream consumer reads --
carried nothing: a run initialized from a cycle's 174 h forecast and a run
initialized from that cycle's analysis produced byte-comparable global
attribute sets, differing only in the model clock.  Publishing the picture
lost the provenance silently.

These guards are written against the file, read back with netCDF4, not
against the attribute dict: only the file knows the union the writer
emits.  Every one of them has a control that must fail without the fix.
