"""Every local-DA test file contributes items, on any installation.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS.  A module-level ``pytest.importorskip`` empties
its whole file at collection when the package is absent, and
``tools/battery/no_silent_deselection.py`` can only report that as SILENT
DESELECTION or be told to excuse the file by name.  The local-DA leg shipped
with one: ``tests/test_local_da_observations.py`` took
``importorskip('woof.globe.obs_table')`` at module scope, so on every
installation without the shared observation package the file's fifteen
adapter contracts reported nothing at all, including the two that need no
such package.

The remedies this tree already names (``tests/test_module_skip_placement``)
are to split the module or to let the dependency skip exactly its own tests.
Both keep the items COLLECTED, which is the only state the guard and the
census floor can see.
