"""A Draw again handed to a render worker that is about to draw keeps what it asked for.

The defect: the worker wrote its job file outside the job lock when it
began a batch (and when it started), reading the file first and writing it
back.  A fresh start landing between that read and that write was written
over: the new attempt's number and products went back to the old ones, the
picture asked for was never drawn, and the worker ended as if nothing had
been asked.
