"""An ERA5 intent on the config-driven route downloads its own forcing.

The breakage this guards: the run door skipped the generated config's
[fetch] recipe for every intent plan, so an ERA5 intent (the point-and-date
door every front end drives) was refused after the plan was accepted with
"declared input(s) this run needs are not on disk" and never downloaded
anything.  The fetch itself is replaced here; what is checked is that the
door asks for it, with the keyless provider and the generated area.
