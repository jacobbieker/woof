"""New Tiedtke's closure flag moves the checkpoint bytes by EXACTLY itself.

``ntiedtke_tiedtke_closure`` joining ``RunConfig`` (49a3f357, "Tiedtke's
deep closure behind a flag, default off") necessarily changes the
checkpoint, because the header echoes the config.  What must be proved is
that it changes it by that ONE key and by nothing else.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS RATHER THAN JUST A RE-PIN.  The flag landed on this
branch and reached the release baseline at the 2.6.1 merge (585c73ae)
without the pins in ``tests/test_restart.py`` moving with it, so the three
tests that read them ran red from that merge until 2026-09-02.  A red pin
is re-pinned by pasting in the new number, and that is precisely the move
these pins exist to make unsafe: "a config field was added" explains a
moved digest, so a checkpoint-FORMAT change riding in behind one -- a
moved header key, a renamed array member, a widened dtype -- would be
absorbed by the same paste.  Here it cannot be.  The reconstruction below
removes the single key and requires the digest the pins carried BEFORE the
flag existed, byte for byte; anything else that moved survives into the
result and this fails.

THE ANCHOR IS MEASURED, NOT INHERITED.  ``_PRE_NTIEDTKE_*`` was re-derived
by checking out ArWen 2.6.0 (91d92f8d) and 8b9f89f1 (2.6.1) and running
the fixture there.  Both reproduce the pair below exactly, which is what
makes it the release value rather than a number copied out of a diff.

Same construction, and the same argument,
``_digest_without_the_wif_config_keys`` makes for the pair that landed
with the mp=28 aerosol work and ``tests/test_adaptive_timestep_checkpoint``
makes for the twelve adaptive-timestep fields.

SCOPE.  This file covers the BYTES.  Whether a checkpoint written before
the flag still RESUMES is a separate question: ``configuration_sha256``
hashes the whole RunConfig, so any field addition invalidates every
checkpoint written before it, and that is this tree's existing behaviour
for every config-surface addition rather than anything this flag did.  The
prepared-cache identity is separately tolerant of the field -- see
``DEFAULT_TOLERANT_IDENTITY_FIELDS`` in ``woof/ingest/prepared_cache.py``,
where it is the first ``run.``-nested member -- which is why the tolerance
question and the byte question have to be asked apart.
