"""``[tiles]`` on the native HRRR chain: the plumbing, and the refusals.

THE DEFECT.  ``[tiles]`` was configurable on this route and unreachable
at the same time.  The single-domain arm hands its forecast the
authority the PREPARER published -- rendered from tables
``tools/hrrr_single_domain_benchmark.py`` builds in code, which are
``{experiment, projection, shared, domain}`` and have never included a
``[tiles]`` -- so a user's block was loaded by run-plan, validated,
reported by ``--resolve``, and then replaced by a document that does not
mention it.  The forecast ran resident.  The only evidence was a line
that never appeared in the log.  Nothing refused, either: the strings
``tiles`` and ``streaming`` appeared zero times in ``woof/runplan.py``.

Two halves are pinned here.  The first is that the user's table now
REACHES the forecast on both arms, and by different routes on purpose:
the single-domain arm carries it as ``--tiles`` because the document it
hands over cannot hold one, and the tree arm carries nothing because the
document it hands over IS the user's config.  The second is the refusal
matrix -- the combinations that cannot stream, refused from the config
alone rather than discovered at the first tile buffer, which on this
chain is a download and two preparations later.

CPU-only.  The chain is captured at its ``run_stage``/``_run_fetch``
seams and the forecast at its ``main`` seam, exactly as
tests/test_runplan_hrrr_tree.py does.
