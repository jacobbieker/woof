"""THE GATE: the LETKF twin experiment must actually improve the state.

Every other test on this filter checks that a piece computes what it claims.
This one checks that the whole thing is worth running, by comparing against a
truth the experiment knows exactly.  It is the only test here that would fail
if the innovation had the wrong sign, and the only one that distinguishes
"the filter runs" from "the filter works".

The numbers below are thresholds, not the measurements.  The measurements are
printed by ``python -m woof.da.osse`` and recorded in the lane handoff; the
thresholds are set well inside them so this gate reports a regression rather
than sampling noise.  Where a margin is thin -- the unobserved wind
components at R = 20 -- the gate says so in the assertion rather than
quietly tightening the seed until it looks comfortable.
