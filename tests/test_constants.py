"""The WRF constant block, and the one place its spelling was a third function.

``share/module_model_constants.F`` declares its derived constants as ``REAL
PARAMETER``.  gfortran folds a parameter expression in the *declared kind*, so
every operation in the chain is rounded to float32; it does not evaluate the
chain in double and round once at the end.  Those are two different functions,
and for ``rvovrd`` they land on two different floats.

Verified rather than assumed.  A probe compiled at ``-O0`` against the
byte-unmodified module on the pinned v4.6.1 tree
(``d66e442fccc04111067e29274c9f9eaccc3cef28``) prints ``transfer(rvovrd, i)``
as ``3FCDDED2``.  The same program routes ``r_v`` and ``r_d`` through an opaque
subroutine, so that divide must happen at runtime on the hardware, and prints
``3FCDDED2`` again -- the fold and the hardware agree.  It also evaluates
``real(461.6d0/287.0d0)`` and prints ``3FCDDED1``.  So gfortran folds in the
declared kind, and the double-then-round spelling this module used to carry was
one ULP low at 1.608 -- two ULP once ``EP_1 = rvovrd - 1`` drops the exponent.
