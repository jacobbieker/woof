"""Documentation line citations must still point at what they claim.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS, measured on this tree 2026-09-17.
``docs/manual/02-dynamics-grids-nesting.md`` sent a reader to
``docs/public/CONFIGURATION.md:235`` and ``:414`` for the ``scalar_adv_opt``
matching rule.  :235 is the middle of a bare list of other key names and
:414 is a sentence about sealed preparation states; the rows that carry the
rule are :332 and :627.  Two lines lower it sent the same reader to :90 for
``spec_bdy_width``, which is the ``## Tweakable knobs`` heading, not the row
at :103.  Three more were the same shape: ``rk_ord`` at :406 instead of
:619, ``h_sca_adv_order`` at :234 instead of :331, and
``radt_ladder_minutes`` at ``woof/domain_wizard.py:1754-1786`` when the
function had moved to :1931-1963.  Nothing checked any of them, and a
citation that lands on unrelated text leaves a reader unable to tell whether
the claim or the pointer is wrong.

This file is the standing half: ``tools/check_doc_anchors.py`` resolves every
in-scope citation, and the first test holds the count of offences at zero.
The rest pin the three judgements the checker makes, because each was wrong
once during the measurement and a checker that mis-classifies is worse than
none: it cries wolf until somebody deletes it.
