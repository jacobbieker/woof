"""G4 -- the first multi-step ``mp_physics=28`` forecast, and the measured
lateral-boundary aerosol depletion rate.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
Before it, every claim in the mp=28 port was a COLUMN claim.  G1 gated device
helpers pointwise, G2 gated single kernels against 48-row Fortran columns, G3
gated the whole adapter against nineteen of those columns -- all of them one
call of ``_apply_thompson_aerosol`` on a state assembled by a test.  Nothing
had ever run mp=28 inside ``dycore.step``: no transport of ``nc``/``nwfa``/
``nifa``, no lateral boundaries, no accumulation across steps, no interaction
between the aerosol tendency accumulators and the persistent scratch arena
that holds them.  A scheme can be column-exact and still be unusable as a
forecast, and the failure modes are exactly the ones a column cannot see --
scratch carried between steps, a transported species that is not advected, a
boundary policy that quietly empties a tracer.

WHAT G4 ASSERTS (MP28_PORT_SPEC.md, "GATES, IN ORDER")
------------------------------------------------------
On a specified-lateral-boundary domain, over a real multi-step integration:

* no NaN anywhere, on any step;
* the aerosol, droplet-number and effective-radius bounds WRF's terminal
  clamp establishes hold on every step, in the region microphysics updates;
* a column WRF leaves at its no-microphysics exit (``:2020``) leaves the
  call with its aerosol above the surface exactly as it entered and its
  droplet number at zero, because that exit comes before the terminal apply;
* the specified-zone ring is BIT-restored by every microphysics call.

THE REGISTERED LBC DEVIATION, MEASURED
--------------------------------------
WOOF carries ``qv`` from an external lateral-boundary snapshot always, and
``nwfa``/``nifa`` beside it whenever the run's aerosol initial state came
from WRF's monthly WIF climatology (``woof/boundary_fields.py``
``external_scalar_fields``; ``woof/ingest/lateral_bc.py``
``COUPLED_SCALAR_STATE_FIELDS``).  WITHOUT that dataset the two aerosol
numbers fall back to WRF's ``flow_dep_bdy`` treatment -- zero gradient on
outflow, ZERO on inflow -- which is the state this file measures below, and
which an externally forced run now has to select deliberately: the doors
that commit to building a forecast refuse it otherwise, before they fetch
anything (``woof.config.validate_experiment_preparation``, measured by
``mp28_aerosol_lateral_forcing_precondition``).  ``nc`` is on the
flow-dependent side either way; ``Registry.EM_COMMON`` declares
``qnwfa``/``qnifa`` with the boundary dimension and ``bdy_interp``, and
stock WRF forces them from the same monthly dataset through
``constants_name``.

The consequence is aerosol-free air advecting in at every inflow face.  It
cannot NaN and cannot go negative.  Where the scheme runs, WRF's terminal
floors (``module_mp_thompson.F:3979-3982``: ``nwfa >= 11.1E6``,
``nifa >= 5.0E3``) hold the air at the floor; in a column with no
condensate and no ice supersaturation WRF returns at ``:2020``, before
the terminal apply, so the clear inflow air keeps its zero aerosol there.
Either way no automated gate anywhere in the tree would ever notice.  It
is a slow, silent, physically wrong trend, and the only defence is to
MEASURE it and publish the number.  That is
:func:`test_lbc_aerosol_depletion_rate_is_measured_on_a_cloud_free_forecast`,
and its result is the headline of
``docs/public/wrf-comparison/mp28-column-evidence.md``.

The measurement is made on a deliberately CLOUD-FREE forecast (WK82's own
sounding with no thermal, which is subsaturated at every level) so that the
aerosol has NO microphysical source or sink at all: the test asserts
``qc == qr == qi == qs == qg == 0`` for the whole run, which makes every
kilogram of lost aerosol attributable to the boundary policy and to nothing
else.  The convective run in
:func:`test_g4_multistep_specified_bc_forecast_is_finite_and_bounded` is the
opposite case and is where the bounds are exercised.

# WRF's own bounds.  Every constant below is transcribed from
# wrf461-pristine/phys/module_mp_thompson.F with its line number,
# and every one of them is a bound the TERMINAL apply establishes -- so it is
# a bound on the state microphysics leaves behind, not on the state transport
# leaves behind.  The distinction is the whole reason the checks below are
# restricted to the microphysics-updated interior; see _INTERIOR_ONLY_NOTE.
#
# "Updated" is a COLUMN property as well as a region.  mp_thompson returns
# at :2020 from a column whose entry cloud, ice, rain, snow and graupel are
# all at or below R1 and which is nowhere supersaturated over ice
# (:1646, :1827-1990), before the terminal apply at :3972-4021, so none of
# these bounds is established there: the column keeps the aerosol transport
# gave it (mp_gt_driver adds the surface emission at k = 0 afterwards,
# :1316-1321), and its droplet number is the zero the entry rewrite wrote
# (:1844-1845).  The adapter records WRF's per-column decision in the
# ``mp_thompson_micro_columns`` scratch slot (1 = updated, 0 = returned at
# :2020), and the checks below read it for every call.

    the ring, so the terminal clamp that holds ``nwfa >= 11.1e6`` in the

    whatever ``flow_dep_bdy`` left, and with no aerosol in the boundary file

    ``qnwfa``/``qnifa`` at the boundary from the monthly dataset, so in WRF

    """THE INVERSE OF THE OLD PINNED GAP.  The profile is installed.

    For four waves this file carried
    ``test_gap_microphysics_init_has_no_production_call_site``, a PASSING
    test asserting that nothing in ``gpuwm/`` called
    ``microphysics.microphysics_init`` -- so every mp=28 forecast began at
    ``nwfa = nifa = 0``, was clamped to WRF's floors
    (``module_mp_thompson.F:3979-3982``) and ran a maritime-clean droplet
    population for its whole length.  That was the single largest
    forecast-relevant defect the port had left.

    It is closed, and this test is what stops it reopening.  The caller is
    ``woof/core/physics.py::initialize_physics``, woof's ``phy_init``,
    which is where WRF calls ``mp_init``
    (``phys/module_physics_init.F:1635``) and therefore where
    ``thompson_init`` runs (``:4522-4538``).  A refactor that dropped the
    call would restore the defect in complete silence -- nothing NaNs,
    nothing goes negative, no health check trips -- which is exactly why the
    scan is a test rather than a review item.

    """WHAT WRF'S SYNTHETIC AEROSOL PROFILE IS WORTH, as a forecast number.

    This test used to be a DEFECT measurement -- the cost of the missing
    ``microphysics_init`` call site.  The call site landed
    (``woof/core/physics.py::initialize_physics``; pinned by
    ``test_microphysics_init_has_a_production_call_site`` above), so the
    default run is now the FILLED one and this is a SENSITIVITY measurement:
    how much of an mp=28 forecast is decided by the CCN/IN loading it starts
    from.  The numbers are the same numbers -- the control run is unchanged
    and the counterfactual is the identical domain with the profile removed
    -- but what they now mean is "this is the part of the forecast the
    aerosol field owns", not "this is what a user is silently losing".

    The sibling column test
    ``test_mp28_runnable.py::test_the_unfilled_aerosol_profile_is_physics_visible_not_cosmetic``
    proves the difference is visible in one call.  Whether it matters to a
    FORECAST is a different question and can only be answered by running two.

    Both runs are IDENTICAL -- same domain, same sounding, same boundaries,
    same wind -- except that the counterfactual skips the production init
    path and therefore starts from ``nwfa = nifa = 0``.  With no aerosol the
    scheme's terminal clamp pins ``nwfa`` at ``11.1e6 kg^-1``
    (``module_mp_thompson.F:3979-3980``) in every column it updates, and the
    entry reads the same floor (``:1805``) wherever cloud forms: a
    maritime-clean CCN population, which activates fewer, larger droplets
    and rains out faster.
    Skipping the init path also leaves the counterfactual without a
    PhysicsDriver, which is measured to be BITWISE irrelevant to this
    forecast (:func:`test_attaching_the_physics_driver_does_not_move_the
    _forecast`), so the aerosol field remains the only live variable.

    The assertion is that the difference is LARGE and in the physically
    expected direction.  The SIZE is printed rather than pinned: pinning it
    would freeze a sensitivity that legitimately depends on the case, the
    resolution and the length of the run.
