"""The MYNN 5/5 suite, actually forecasting.

Every other MYNN test in this repository measures a routine in isolation
against an oracle CSV.  This one runs the model: a moist convective sounding
over mixed land and water, stepped through RK3 with
``sf_sfclay_physics=5``, ``sf_surface_physics=2`` and ``bl_pbl_physics=5``,
and it asserts the things that separate "ported" from "runs":

* the selector reaches MYNN and not YSU;
* the ten carried 3-D arrays exist, start at WRF's zero cold state, and are
  filled by the first call;
* the PBL top actually moves and the diffusivity actually grows, which is
  what says the scheme is coupled rather than merely called;
* nothing goes non-finite;
* a restart round trip reproduces every carried array bit for bit **and**
  the next step from the restored state is bit identical, which is the
  property a checkpoint is for; and
* wrfout carries the MYNN names.

The vertical grid is stretched deliberately.  On a uniform 40-level grid to
16 km the first interface sits near 400 m, and WRF's ``GET_PBLH`` searches
for the minimum theta_v only below 200 m (``module_bl_mynn.F:5537-5546``);
with an empty search window the whole theta-based branch degenerates to
``zw(2)`` and the PBL top is pinned at the first interface for the entire
run.  That is not a woof defect -- it is what WRF does on a grid no real
configuration uses -- but a test on such a grid would assert nothing.

    This is a bracket on **this census**, not on the routine.  Sampled after
    twenty steps the census looks like a threshold near 10 m, and an earlier
    revision of this docstring and of
    ``docs/mynn_noahmp_ruc_completion_plan.md`` said MYNN "stops producing
    plumes entirely" below it.  **That reading is wrong.**  Re-swept with the
    census taken at every step for sixty steps, first-layer depth delays the
    onset rather than gating it: plumes appear at step 12 at dz1 = 22.8 m, at
    step 26 at 8.9 m, at step ~28 by 5 m and at step 41 at 1.67 m, and below
    about 4 m the activation flickers on and off.  Every depth measured from
    22.8 m down to 1.67 m eventually produces plumes; only 1.31 m had none
    within sixty steps.  No run went non-finite and peak ``|w|`` stayed under
    0.75 m/s, so the flicker is not a blow-up.  The measured sweep is the
    table in ``docs/mynn_noahmp_ruc_completion_plan.md``.

    The consequence for this test: a fixed-step census is non-monotone in
    dz1, so the three rows below are a tripwire on the census and nothing
    more.  They are kept because moving them still means something changed in
    ``DMP_mf`` or in the surface fluxes feeding it, and somebody then has to
    decide whether the move was toward WRF or away from it.

    Whether unmodified WRF behaves the same way is **not established here**.
    The pinned ``woof/data/mynn/oracle/dmp-mf.csv`` has a thinnest first
    layer of 20 m across all twelve columns, so the fixture never reached
    this regime and cannot answer it.

    It matters beyond curiosity because the near-surface spacing involved is
    not exotic -- an LES-adjacent nest is exactly where a first layer under
    10 m appears.
