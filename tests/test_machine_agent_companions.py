"""A Machines node writes a forecast's plan and its companion files as sent, and one launch of a name at a time.

The defects this file holds shut:

- A storm-following layout's configuration, Vtable and WPS namelist could
  not reach a node: the launch took JSON documents only, and a text file
  passed through it would have been written as one quoted JSON string.
- A sent file name was checked only by its pattern: a Windows device name
  or one of the files the supervisor keeps (its job record, its logs)
  could be written over.
- Two launches of one name at once both wrote the folder and both started.
- The claim must not refuse what a queued forecast needs: a launch that did
  not start (the card was busy, its supervisor could not start) leaves a
  folder the next launch of that name takes.
