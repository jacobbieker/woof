    # and module_small_step_em.F:861-862/935-936); the flat-base entries
    # were verified bitwise unchanged by that fix at recapture time.
    #
    # The moist/* entries were recaptured after the WRF sumflux parity fix
    # (scalars advected with the acoustic time-averaged mass fluxes
    # ru_m/rv_m/ww_m, solve_em.F:2210-2212 / module_small_step_em.F:1473),

    # Merge note (p4w-pgf x p4w-transport): the shipped npz is the verified

    # on both sides at merge time.  The pin's msf==1 guarantee is
    # unchanged: subsequent msf work must keep this capture bitwise.

    # h_diabatic merge (e72db7d): the microphysics finish now writes theta
    # through the h_diabatic increment ((th_new-t_save) re-added), an
    # FP32 op-order change that legitimately moves the moist case by ULPs
    # even with zero net heating: verified by both W6 reviewers and
    # adjudicated on GPU (u/v/w/thp/php/mup/qv moved; qc/qr and all
    # dry/terrain/open entries stayed bitwise, 38/39 pre-recapture).
    #
    # RECAPTURED TWICE on 2026-09-03 (lane/fp32-eos-spelling, commits
    # 962c068da then 6b11e4c99), 25 of 27 entries moving each time -- the
    # two that held are moist/qc and moist/qr, which are identically zero.
    #
    #   962c068da recaptured at the UNPATCHED tip, with the working tree
    #   byte-identical to d9e48213d, because [dry_flat] and [terrain] were
    #   ALREADY RED there: the shipped file differed from a fresh run of
    #   the same builders in 25 of 27 entries (largest, dry_flat/mup,
    #   2.293e-02 on an rms of 1.081e+01).  That drift is NOT root-caused.
    #   The recapture states what the builders produce there.  It is not
    #   a claim that those numbers are right.
    #
    #   6b11e4c99 recaptured after the EOS geopotential fix, which moves
    #   every run's bits by construction (calc_p_alpha stopped forming the
    #   base layer thickness by cancelling two totals).
    #
    # RECAPTURED on 2026-09-16 (lane/2.7.6-omega-column-scan) by
    # tools/recapture_phase2_pin.py, the generator now kept in the tree, in
    # two readings because the move has two causes:
    #
    #   (a) [dry_flat] and [terrain] were ALREADY RED at the base
    #   c36f4c1f1, the 2.7.5 release tip: with the shipped file restored, a
    #   run there fails u on 2870 of 2880 words (max abs 1.569e-04) and
    #   terrain/u on 2661 of 2720 (1.675e-04), and a fresh capture at that
    #   base differs from the shipped file in 25 of 27 entries (largest
    #   open/v 2.033e-02 on an rms of 1.762e-02, open/mup 1.882e+00 on
    #   9.396e+00, dry_flat/mup 1.669e-02 on 1.081e+01, terrain/mup
    #   3.055e-02 on 5.539e+00).  The dry dynamics moved after the
    #   2026-09-03 recapture without this file following; the release
    #   contract set does not run this GPU test, so 2.7.5 shipped it red.
    #   That drift is NOT root-caused here either, and this capture
    #   states what a run produces rather than that it is right.
    #
    #   (b) The Omega column kernel (calc_ww_cp one column per thread in
    #   WRF's own operation order, replacing CuPy's sum/cumsum) moves every
    #   stepped run's bits by construction.  Its own reading, base capture
    #   against lane capture on the same card, same builders: 25 of 27
    #   entries, largest moist/v 3.313e-04 on an rms of 3.286e-02 (1.0e-2),
    #   open/v 1.420e-04 on 1.758e-02 (8.1e-3), dry_flat/mup 2.494e-02 on
    #   1.081e+01 (2.3e-3), terrain/mup 5.758e-03 on 5.539e+00 (1.0e-3);
    #   moist/qc and moist/qr, identically zero, held.  Sixty steps of the
    #   seeded 64x64x32 benchmark state put u, v, w, thp, php, mup within
    #   1.7e-4 to 7.2e-4 of each field's maximum (docs/manual/
    #   04-gpu-numerics.md section 4.3).  Both readings are committed under
    #   tests/data/receipts/omega-column-scan/ as
    #   phase2-pin-shipped-vs-base.json and phase2-pin-base-vs-lane.json.
    #
    # THE CONSEQUENCE, stated plainly because the sentence below no longer
    # says it: this file describes THIS TIP, not Phase 2.  The dry
    # dynamics have moved under it many times since add26dc.  Its live
    # value is detecting the NEXT change to the msf==1 path; it is no
    # longer evidence of equivalence with the pre-Task-3 code, and it
    # cannot be used to attribute the drift above.
    #
    # NAMED FOLLOW-UP, and the reason this ledger matters: the acoustic
    # solver still spells the cancellation the EOS just shed.
    # woof/core/kernels/acoustic.cu:831-843 and :1064-1076 (advance_w_phi
    # and its msf twin) build the wdwn layer thickness as
    # (phb[k+1]+php[k+1]) - (phb[k]+php[k]) in float32, once per ACOUSTIC
    # SUBSTEP rather than once per RK stage.  Measured 2026-09-03 against
    # a float64 truth on make_base_state columns, max relative error in
    # the thickness:
    #
    #     nz=16  ztop=6400   7.67e-07  ->  6.10e-08  with dphb_resid
    #     nz=64  ztop=2400   1.24e-04  ->  5.15e-06
    #     nz=160 ztop=2400   5.62e-05  ->  1.68e-06
    #     nz=160 ztop=20000  1.46e-05  ->  1.56e-07
    #
    # i.e. 12.6x-93.4x, growing 73x from nz=16 to nz=160 -- the direction
    # every LES configuration moves.  The fix needs NO new memory:
    # dphb_resid is already resident and already carries the (bstr, boff)
    # stride convention advance_w uses.  It was NOT taken here because it
    # moves this pin a THIRD time in one day, and a third recapture on top
    # of an un-root-caused drift would leave nothing able to attribute any
    # of the three.  The pin has an independent grader that does not need
    # recapturing -- tests/test_acoustic.py::test_w_phi_solve_matches_
    # reference, against the genuine float64 np_acoustic_substep mirror
    # (npref.py:2837 differences the geopotential in float64) -- and that
    # is the instrument the follow-up should use.

    # 2026-09-17 (lane/2.7.6-pin-gates): THE CARD, AND THE ATTRIBUTION OF
    # (a) ABOVE.  A development machine's card became an RTX 4090 (compute capability 8.9,
    # driver 610.57.04); every 2026-09-16 reading above was taken on the
    # RTX 5070 Ti (12.0) it replaced, and the two 2026-09-03 recaptures say
    # RTX 3080 (8.6) in their messages.  Measured on the 4090 in one
    # session, with tools/recapture_phase2_pin.py's readings and a scratch
    # copy of its capture checked out at each commit (receipts under
    # tests/data/receipts/pin-gates/):
    #
    #   The pin is CARD-DEPENDENT.  The committed file (5070 Ti bytes) run
    #   at fc639c51f on the 4090: [dry_flat] and [terrain] red, 25 of 27
    #   entries differ, dry_flat/mup 2.274e-02 on an rms of 1.081e+01,
    #   terrain/mup 2.693e-02 on 5.539, dry_flat/u 1.502e-04 on 3.732,
    #   open/v 2.031e-02 on 1.758e-02, open/mup 1.888 on 9.390; moist/qc
    #   and moist/qr held (phase2-pin-4090-vs-committed-fc639c51f.json).
    #   The same builders twice at fc639c51f on the 4090: 0 of 27 differ
    #   (phase2-pin-4090-run1-vs-run2-at-fc639c51f.json).
    #
    #   The 3080 and the 4090 AGREE: the file committed at 6b11e4c99,
    #   captured on the 3080, against a 4090 capture at 6b11e4c99: 0 of 27
    #   entries differ (phase2-pin-3080-vs-4090-at-6b11e4c99.json).
    #
    #   NO COMMIT moved dry_flat or terrain between 6b11e4c99 and the 2.7.5
    #   tip c36f4c1f1 on one card: 4090 captures at 6b11e4c99, a355a7673
    #   (rk_addtend_dry's 1/msf) and fd44111c3 (tiles, derived base-state
    #   arrays) are bit-identical in all 27 entries; 877dc8e97 (scalar
    #   diff6 takes dt/3) moves exactly the seven moist entries (u, v, w,
    #   thp, php, mup, qv; largest moist/mup 2.371e-02 on 1.628e+01) and
    #   nothing dry, which is what its message declares ("the dry rows are
    #   unchanged"), a closed matter; fc20bfc5a and c36f4c1f1 carry
    #   877dc8e97's bytes exactly.  So the drift in (a), "already red at
    #   c36f4c1f1", was the 2026-09-03 file, captured on a 3080, graded on
    #   a 5070 Ti: card, not code.  The Omega kernel's own move on the
    #   4090, c36f4c1f1 against fc639c51f, is 25 of 27 entries, in line
    #   with (b) (phase2-pin-4090-c36f4c1f1-vs-fc639c51f.json).
    #
    #   CONSEQUENCE: this file describes one tip ON ONE CARD.  The 5070 Ti
    #   file is kept as committed, a 4090 file is added beside it with the
    #   first reading above as its reading, tests/_phase2_pin.py PIN_FILES
    #   maps the device name to the file, and a card with no file SKIPS
    #   here with the reason, because a gate that fails for the card and
    #   not the code prevents no breakage.  tools/release/precut_gpu_gate.py
    #   runs this test on the release node's card before a cut and records
    #   the card in its receipt, which is what 2.7.4 and 2.7.5 lacked.
