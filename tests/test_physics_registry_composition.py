"""The composition rule, its blast radius, and the ground truth beneath it.

Two receipts are the subject here.  ``F2-ground-truth.json`` records what
the production resolvers return for the default template and for the
legacy-RRTMG run of record; ``F2-composition-blast-radius.json`` enumerates
every registered template under all three candidate composition axes.  Both
are regenerated here and compared byte for byte, so a registry edit that
changes either one has to land the receipt with it.
