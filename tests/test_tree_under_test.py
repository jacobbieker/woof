"""The instrument that says which checkout the suite actually measured.

An editable install binds ``woof`` and ``tools`` to ONE directory through
a finder on ``sys.meta_path``, and a meta-path finder answers before
``sys.path`` does.  A lane running its suite inside ``git worktree``
therefore imports the MAIN checkout, executes none of its own edits, and
prints a number of passing tests about a tree it never touched.

That is not a hypothetical.  It was found while verifying a harness lane:
``tools/check_negation_invariant.py`` had a committed fix, and five tests
of that fix FAILED in the worktree holding it -- because the worktree was
running the unfixed copy from the main checkout.  The same hole was under
every other lane worktree on the box, in the other direction: a broken
edit would have gone green.

``tools/tree_under_test.py`` closes it, ``tests/conftest.py`` refuses the
session when it fires, and this file is the both-direction proof.  The
predicate takes its modules as an argument precisely so the RED direction
can be tested without arranging a second checkout on disk.
