# tests/test_wrfout_global_attribute_set.py
"""Exact global-attribute SET of a frame written through the production path.

Nothing in the suite watches the wrfout global-attribute set as a set.  Field
inventories and individual attribute values are guarded elsewhere; an
attribute ADDED to every emitted file passes all of it.  That is the change a
capsule-versus-sidecar decision would make, so the guard has to exist before
the decision is taken rather than after, or the decision is taken blind.

The golden set is whatever ``woof.runtime._global_wrf_attrs`` +
``WrfoutWriter`` emit at this commit, read back off a real NETCDF4_CLASSIC
file with netCDF4 rather than off the attrs dict: the writer adds its own
header attributes on top of the caller's, and only the file knows the union.
The mutation control adds one synthetic global and requires the guard to fail.
