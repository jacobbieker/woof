"""A progress heartbeat must never kill the forecast it reports on.

MEASURED, 2026-08-17, Windows 11, RTX 3080, woof 2.4.1 wheel: a
`woof-prepared-tree-forecast` 12-3 km run died at outer step 76 of 120
with ``PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is denied`` inside
``progress_callback`` -> ``_atomic_json`` -> ``os.replace``, because a
reader held ``evidence/progress.json`` open at the instant the runner
republished it.  On Windows a plain ``open()`` for READ denies rename
over the file (no FILE_SHARE_DELETE), so the documented act of watching
the documented progress file -- FIRST-LIGHT.md: "Watch progress at
``<outdir>/evidence/progress.json``" -- can abort a healthy CUDA run.
``woof go``'s own stopwatch heartbeat reads the same file on a 20 s
poll, so the product races itself without any user involved.

The supervisor already ships the doctrine (`woof.supervisor`):
bounded-backoff retry for every publication, and quarantine-the-temp
for heartbeats -- "a stale heartbeat is safer than terminating a healthy
CUDA worker".  These tests hold the two prepared runners to it.
