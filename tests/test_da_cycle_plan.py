"""The sweep planner's filter probe checks the knobs the arms turn on.

CPU only.  The planner runs no model: it pushes every step's argv through
the real parser of the tool that will run it and asks the real
``RadarAssimilationConfig`` whether the configuration it describes would
be accepted.  These cells pin what that probe can and cannot see, because
the audit (R-051) found it constructing a configuration with the
reflectivity arm hardcoded OFF -- so a plan whose run would assimilate
reflectivity was checked as if it would not.
