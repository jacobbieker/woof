"""The prep door forwards the tools the subcommand it actually runs needs.

Measured breakage, at integration tip a6867e712 on 2026-08-18::

    python -m woof.source_cli --source hrrr-prs ... --dry-run
    # -> ... -m woof.mapped_direct --source-format grib2 ...
    #    (no --grib2-inventory, no --grib2-dump)

    python -m woof.mapped_direct <that exact argv>
    # ValueError: grib2 decoder inventory differs from the contract;
    #             missing=['grib2_dump', 'grib2_inventory'], extra=[]

Bare default preparation was broken for every one of the twelve
registered ``mapped_composition_v1`` sources and for the generic
``mapped`` route, and it was broken as an unhandled traceback out of
``woof/mapped_composition.py``.

The cause was one question asked about the wrong thing.  The Rust
engine's capability table declares its answers PER SUBCOMMAND -- it
decodes GRIB2 in process and it composes nothing at all -- while the
front door asked only ``which engine is the default`` and concluded
"Rust, so no subprocess tools are wanted".  The mapped route ALWAYS
composes (``mapped_direct.prepare_mapped_wrf`` says so in its own
comment), so the composed child was launched with the Python engine's
work to do and none of the Python engine's tools.

The contract these tests hold:

* the door consults ``ENGINE_CAPABILITIES`` for the subcommand the
  route will run, not for the engine default, and forwards exactly what
  that answer needs;
* the invocation the door prints RUNS -- these tests execute it rather
  than reading it, because an argv assertion is exactly what stayed
  green while the route was dead;
* tools that genuinely cannot resolve produce a named refusal with the
  install-aware remedy, at the door and in the child, never a
  traceback.

**Both directions, since the compose port landed.**  The engine now
composes GRIB1, GRIB2 and NetCDF, so a bare prep forwards NO tool pins
and the composed child resolves the engine row instead.  That is not a
reason to stop measuring the other direction: the outage was a
DISPATCH fault, not a fact about one table state, and it comes back the
moment a site answers about the wrong subcommand.  So every forwarding
row below runs twice -- once against the real table, where nothing is
pinned, and once against a table monkeypatched to un-declare ``compose``
for the format in hand, where the ladder-resolved tools must appear.
A single-direction test would go green again if the door started
answering about ``decode``, because ``decode`` and ``compose`` now agree.

# Every row above filters the registry to `runner ==
# "mapped_composition_v1"`, which is the route the compose port changed.
# That filter is also a blind spot, and it hid a live one: `woof prep
# --source 20crv3` is a registered, runnable, packaged-profile door whose
# runner (`woof.twentycrv3_wrf`) decodes through the subprocess GRIB2
# tools, builds its `MappedSourceBundle` in host Python and hands it to
# `prepare_mapped_wrf` as `_predecoded_bundle` -- the one branch that
# skips `decode_composed_source`.  A bare prep of it therefore resolves
# `grib2_inventory`/`grib2_dump` from the staged ladder while the
# capability table, `woof doctor` and the CLI reference all reported a
# clean estate.
#
# So the invariant is stated over the WHOLE registry, and it is the one
# a reader of `ENGINE_GAPS` is entitled to: a door either forwards no
# decoder tool, or it is named in `ENGINE_GAPS`.  Both directions, so the
# entry cannot outlive the gap it describes.

#: Every runnable registered source, from the registry rather than a
#: list: a model added as table data inherits this coverage.
RUNNABLE_SOURCES = tuple(sorted(
    adapter.source_id for adapter in source_adapters() if adapter.runnable))
