"""The ``zcons`` family: gate the constants that look alike.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Two failures in this port are the same failure:
**resolution by apparent identity instead of by provenance** (framing:
review):

* ``pmfude_rate`` at cuascn's output *looked like* ``pmfude_rate`` at the
  adjustments block's entry. Same name, same array, different value,
  because :746-819 rescaled it in between. Resolved by name, and the
  mirror came out 1.26x low on 42 of 108 columns (§23).
* ``zcons`` in one scope *looks like* ``zcons`` in another. Same name,
  different literal factor. Resolved by name, and you get a value whose
  provenance is a different scope.

The second has already produced one misreading, the cuascn mirror and
kernel both carried a comment claiming cuascn's cap is "three times looser
than the closure's", which is **false**: ``zcons2`` is ``3/(g*dt)`` in all
three scopes that declare it and they are identical. What differs by three
is ``zcons`` against ``zcons2``, one character apart, both live in
``cumastrn``, and ``zcons`` has exactly ONE consumer.

A wrong ``1/(g*dt)`` factor produces mass fluxes that are finite, plausible
and off by a fixed ratio: the least visible arithmetic error available, and
one that would read as a physics disappointment at f012 rather than a bug.

Built BEFORE porting :996-1016, which is ``zcons``'s only consumer.
