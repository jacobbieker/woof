"""The Noah-MP CUDA gates' checks that need no device, where they can run.

These four assertions were written inside
``tests/test_noahmp_sflx_cuda.py`` and ``tests/test_noahmp_water_cuda.py``,
above each file's ``cp = pytest.importorskip("cupy")``, under a banner
saying "the checks that need no GPU".  They have never run.  A module-level
skip fires at IMPORT, so it takes the tests defined above it with it, and
``tests/conftest.py`` separately marks a module ``gpu`` in its entirety when
a cupy import appears at module scope.  Two independent reasons, same
outcome: collected zero, on every box, on every cut.

The WATER pair is the sharpest illustration -- its own module docstring
says of ``test_imported_sections_match_their_sources``, "That test needs no
GPU and runs everywhere."  It ran nowhere.

What they protect is real and is not device work:

* ``noahmp_sflx.cu``'s SC_/OU_ index blocks and the Python packing tables
  are two spellings of one layout.  A field added on one side alone shifts
  every column after it, which a bitwise gate then reports as physics.
* ``noahmp_sflx.cu`` covers ERROR and NOAHMP_SFLX's marshalling only, and
  must not quietly grow a call into another subsystem.
* ``noahmp_water.cu`` carries verbatim COPIES of ``noahmp_soilwater.cu``
  and ``noahmp_snow.cu``, because CuPy's RawModule compiles from a string
  with no include path.  If either source lane fixes an arithmetic site,
  this is what fails until the fix is carried across -- instead of the
  water file holding an older transcription its own device gate happens to
  accept.
* And the drift check's own falsifiability: a one-character change to a
  source must break the equality.
