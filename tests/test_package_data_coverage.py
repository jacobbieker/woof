"""Every non-Python file under ``gpuwm/`` must be declared as package data.

The whole suite reads its oracle fixtures and parameter tables out of the
source tree, so a file that is missing from ``[tool.setuptools.package-data]``
still passes every test while the built wheel silently omits it.  That is not a
hypothetical: before this gate existed the declaration was a hand-maintained
enumeration that had fallen 52 files behind, including three assets the model
loads at *runtime* rather than only under test --
``data/kf_lutab/kf_lutab.npz`` (``woof.core.kf``), ``data/noahmp/*.TBL``
(``woof.core.noahmp``) and ``data/ruc/oracle/tbq.csv``
(``woof.core.ruc._load_ruc_saturation_table``).  An install of that wheel
raises ``FileNotFoundError`` the first time those schemes are used.

The check runs setuptools' own :meth:`build_py.find_data_files` against the
real ``pyproject.toml`` rather than re-implementing pattern matching, so what
it reports is what the wheel would actually contain.  It is a filesystem walk,
not a ``git ls-files`` walk, so an undeclared file trips it before it is ever
committed.

(It also walks ``mpas_cycle_bridge/``, the other top-level package the
wheel carries.  That package's worker runs from the INSTALLED copy, in an
interpreter the cycle door names, and resolves what it reads beside its own
modules -- so a data file that grows there and is not declared is dropped
from the wheel and missed by every in-tree run, which finds it through the
checkout.  It carries no data file today; the walk is what keeps the first
one from being lost.)

Why the walk stops at ``gpuwm/``
-------------------------------
``tools`` is a declared package too, but it is not a data directory: it is
mostly scripts, plus two vendored Rust workspaces whose source is *build
input* and has no business in a wheel.  A blanket "everything under ``tools``
must ship" rule would be wrong in 260 MB of ways.

That exemption is exactly how the renderer's map assets disappeared.
``tools/rustwx/assets/basemap`` holds the Natural Earth and US Census
shapefiles ``rw_wrfbatch`` draws coastlines and borders from -- runtime data
living inside a directory this file had decided not to look at -- and the one
``package-data`` entry still written as an enumeration, ``tools =
["prepare_hrrr_*.sh"]``, did not name them.  Nothing failed.  A pip install
rendered a tropical cyclone over a blank rectangle.

So the rule is not "walk more", it is "every *runtime* asset must be
delivered by some declared mechanism, and the test names which".  For the
renderer's assets that mechanism is the bridge bundle rather than the wheel
(the wheel is 74.6 MiB against PyPI's 100 MB per-file cap and the assets
deflate to 20.2 MiB), which
:func:`test_the_renderer_asset_tree_is_delivered_by_a_declared_mechanism`
checks against ``woof.bridge_assets``.  The bundle alone was not enough: a
wheel install reaches it only through ``woof fetch-bridges``, which no
install text ran, so since 2.8.0 the ``recast-woof-data`` companion carries the
renderer's layer directories as well, and
:func:`test_the_companion_wheel_ships_the_renderers_map_layers` holds its
wheel to them.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHICH PACKAGES a wheel carries, as opposed to which data files
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Everything above measures ``package-data`` -- the files inside packages
# that are already known.  This section measures the step before it:
# ``[tool.setuptools.packages.find]``, which decides what a package IS.
#
# The breakage that earned it, measured on a real
# ``python -m build --wheel``: gpuwm-2.5.0-py3-none-any.whl carried
# ``recast-woof-data/woof_data/__init__.py`` and its top_level.txt named
# ``recast-woof-data``, because ``include = ["woof*"]`` is fnmatch over
# DIRECTORY names and the sibling distribution's project directory is
# called ``recast-woof-data``.  Installing that wheel drops a bare
# ``recast-woof-data/woof_data/`` into site-packages: a woof_data package
# with no ``data/`` beside it, which the resolver's checkout rung then
# finds -- one fragment of another distribution, shipped by this one, in
# a position to answer for it.

#: The top-level names this project's wheel may contain, verbatim from
#: the reasoning in pyproject.toml's ``find`` block.  Written out rather
#: than derived from the include patterns, because a pattern that has
#: started matching something new is exactly what this pins.
#: ``mpas_cycle_bridge`` is deliberate: it is the far side of the MPAS
#: port seam and must be importable from an installed copy because
#: ``woof.cycle.anchor`` imports from it at module scope -- see the
#: ``find`` block's own comment.
