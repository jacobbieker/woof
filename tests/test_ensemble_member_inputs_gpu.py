"""The plain ``--members N`` door, end to end on a card: real members or a refusal.

These run the commands a user types.  ``woof domain`` writes a small
one-domain config; ``woof ensemble CONFIG --members 2`` names no recipe.

* On a source whose adapter row declares a runnable operational ensemble,
  the door plans two of its members, fetches and prepares each through
  that source's own chain, and runs them: exit 0, and the members differ
  from the first frame on.
* On a source that declares none, the door exits 2 with the breakage and
  the remedy before anything is downloaded.

The defect this holds closed: both commands used to fetch ONE trajectory,
run it N times, and publish zero spread and 0 or 1 probabilities.

Nothing is mocked, so the tests need a CUDA card, the provider network
(about 0.5 GB of source files, cached under ``WOOF_RECIPE_DOOR_OUTDIR``
when that is set) and the WPS geography tree.  They are gated on
``WOOF_NETWORK_TESTS=1``.
