"""The wizard-emits/adapter-accepts round-trip gate (task #204).

``woof domain --source X`` writes a config, and source X's OWN adapter
must accept that exact file at least through config validation.  Nothing
gated that until the 2.2.0 verification campaign ran the documented ERA5
chain end-to-end and found the door dead on arrival: the wizard emits
``[case_data]`` for ERA5, the ERA5 adapter loaded through
``woof.experiment.load_experiment`` (which split off ``[fetch]`` but not
``[case_data]``), and the refusal claimed the config "does not have a
table 'case_data'" -- about a table that sat in the file, present and
valid.  Every emission here goes through the real wizard and every
acceptance through the real adapter seam, CPU-hermetic: no fetch, no
bridge, no card.

The negative controls at the bottom pin the refusal-message CLASS the
incident exposed: a table that is present but unconsumed must be
reported as a caller routing defect, never as absent, while a genuinely
unknown table keeps its "does not have a table" refusal.
