"""``rw_ensbatch`` / ``rw_obsgrid``: the seam, the contract, the artifacts.

The two binaries that close the render law's remaining holes -- ensemble
products (``woof/da/enprod.py`` said outright there was "no second engine
to switch to") and gridded radar observations.

Like ``tests/test_render_rust.py``, nothing here mocks an engine: the
end-to-end tests drive the real executables this checkout built, and skip
accurately when it has not built them.  What IS stubbed is the subprocess
layer of the resolver's decision table, because a stale-build refusal
cannot be produced without shipping a stale build.
