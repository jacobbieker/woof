"""Spawn-at-trigger under ``[tiles]``: the three places it went wrong.

``tilestream/test_spawn_stream.py`` is the GPU half of this -- it measures
what a streamed domain's trigger plane actually contains.  This file is the
wiring half, and it runs on NumPy states with ``dycore.step`` mocked, the same
instrument rule ``tests/test_spawn_runner.py`` states: the objects under test
here are the executor, the leg walk and the route, and none of them inspects a
value.

The three defects, each with the test that reproduces it:

1.  THE ROUTE NEVER LOOKED AT ``[tiles]`` AT ALL.
    ``woof.runtime.run_experiment``'s domain-tree branch is the only route
    that drives a spawn (``walk_spawn_legs``); the only two routes that built
    a stepper mapping are the PREPARED forecast routes, and both of those
    refuse a dormant nest by name (``experiment.refuse_unrouted_spawn``).
    So spawning and streaming were on disjoint routes, and a spawn
    experiment configured ``mode = "on"`` ran fully resident with nothing
    saying so -- the block was parsed, validated and echoed into the
    resolved-config report, and then dropped.

2.  A NEWBORN WAS NEVER ADJUDICATED.
    ``streaming.steppers_for_tree`` walks the tree ONCE, before the run.
    ``walk_spawn_legs`` calls ``execute_experiment`` once per LEG with that
    same mapping, and a domain born at a leg boundary is not in it, so
    ``model.py``'s ``steppers.get(grid_id, step)`` resolved it to
    ``dycore.step``.  The comment that fallback carries is about a
    DELAYED-START child -- a domain that was in the tree when the mapping was
    built and simply had not started -- and it was written before streaming
    existed.

3.  THE TRIGGER READ A DEAD PLANE.
    ``SpawnWatch.evaluate`` takes its plane off ``parent_state``; a streamed
    domain's arrays live in its store and its ``DomainState`` stops changing
    at attach.  The GPU half measures the plane; here we pin that the leg
    walk performs the store->state publish before evaluating and the
    state->store adopt after, so the runner's own window reset reaches the
    domain.

WHY SIX OF THESE NINE CARRY ``@pytest.mark.gpu``

The instrument is NumPy end to end and nothing here asserts a value, but
``execute_experiment`` releases the CuPy default pool's UNUSED blocks on
every step and every period commit (``model._trim_default_pool``, and
``pool_trim_per_period`` defaults to True), so the six tests that drive a
real leg walk open a CUDA context anyway.  Unmarked, they were green on NO
machine and had been since v2.0.0: they hard-failed
``cudaErrorNoDevice`` under the release battery's mandated CPU-only stage-1
leg (``GPUWM_NO_LOCAL_GPU=1``, whose conftest backstop sets
``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1``), and an unmarked test is DESELECTED by the
rented card's ``-m gpu`` shard, so the shard never covered them either.

The marker is per test rather than a module-wide ``pytestmark`` on purpose.
The other three never call ``execute_experiment``, they are the only CPU
coverage this file has, and marking the module wholesale would trade one
silent gap for another -- ``tests/test_gpu_marker_discipline.py`` states the
rule this follows: over-marking is coverage loss wearing a safety costume.

The device contact is at CALL time, not import or collection time: this file
collects cleanly on a device-free box (9 collected, no CUDA context), so the
markers are the whole fix here.  Teaching ``_trim_default_pool`` to no-op
without a device would let all nine run CPU-only, but that is a change to a
default-on product path in the memory-pressure code, and it belongs to its
own ruling rather than to a marker repair.
