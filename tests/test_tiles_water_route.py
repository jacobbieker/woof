"""The tiles real-case preparers assemble their water temperature.

The 2.0 battery's twin_a row: every streamed real-case run on an ERA5
source carrying SST was refused at prepare, because
``tilestream/realcase.py`` handed soil preprocessing a raw SST beside its
SKINTEMP with no assembled water temperature -- the exact configuration
task #168 made a refusal (``woof.ingest.water_temperature.
require_assembled_water_temperature``).  The mainline routes adopted
``assemble_for_route``; the tiles route did not.

Two halves, matching the shape of the mainline gate in
``tests/test_water_temperature.py``:

RECEIPT-IMPLIES-CONSUMPTION, structurally -- every soil-router call in
``tilestream/realcase.py`` forwards ``water_temperature`` and names its
``route``, checked by AST so a revert on EITHER preparer goes red.

THE ASSEMBLY ITSELF, functionally -- ``realcase.assembled_water_
temperature`` on a tiny synthetic domain produces a field the soil
router's refusal accepts, chooses per-body providers rather than the
per-cell fuse, and the refusal control shows what the fix closed.

CPU only: the assembly is host NumPy end to end.
