"""Stage subprocesses import from the install, not from the caller.

Every stage of the prepared chain -- both GFS routes and both HRRR
routes -- is spawned as ``python -m MODULE``, and ``-m`` prepends the
CURRENT DIRECTORY to ``sys.path``, ahead of the installed package.
:func:`woof.go_cli._stage_cwd` is deliberately the caller's directory
so a relative ``--out`` means what the person typing it meant, which is
what made this reachable: a chain started from inside a source checkout
imported that checkout instead of the install, and a live run was
hijacked exactly that way.

Moving the cwd would have fixed the imports and broken the relative
paths.  These pin the fix that separates the two.
