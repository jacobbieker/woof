"""[spectral_numerics] through the resolved experiment and the slow-step seam.

CPU-only coverage of the Level-2 wiring: the config rides the experiment
TOML into ``ExperimentConfig``, binds the restart identity when present
(and only then), refuses the loops that cannot honor it, refuses a
streamed domain at attach (the one door standing) out of a sentence one
function holds, so the configuration-alone answer beside it cannot drift
from it, refuses false periodic declarations, ledgers receipts per
committed step, and blocks a clean completion capsule when apply receipts
are missing.  The one GPU-shaped line -- the ``execute_experiment`` STEP
op calling the seam -- is held in place by a source-order gate, because a hook
that drifts out of the commit point (into an acoustic substep, after
output, or out of the file entirely) is precisely the breakage the
delivered survey existed to prevent.
