"""The native HRRR decoder puts its own snow undershoot at zero.

It maps snow water and snow depth with the overlapping parabola, whose
negative weights take a patch with little snow inside a snowpack below
zero by up to 9/32 of the snow around it.  A 2x2 patch holding a trace of
snow (a valley floor that has nearly melted out) inside snow at the
field's maximum reaches about -17/64 of it at the patch centre, past the
quarter the snow admission used to refuse beyond.  (A patch of exactly
zero maps to zero at its centre: WPS's ``oned`` answers zero where both
middle points are zero.)  From a non-negative source every negative
result is that undershoot, so the decoder zeroes it where the source is
known and leaves every other value as the parabola made it.
