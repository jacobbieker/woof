"""Forecasts publish their files on an exFAT drive.

Two things exFAT does differently from NTFS and ext4 each failed every
run whose folder was on such a drive:

- It derives a file's id from its directory entry, and the rename that
  publishes a history file moves that entry, so the id the writer validated
  was not the id the published file reported. Every forecast failed at its
  first wrfout (GS-09).
- It has no hard links, which every create-only publisher used, so
  preparation failed at its first manifest with "[WinError 1] Incorrect
  function".

Only a real exFAT volume on Windows reproduces either: name a folder on one
with WOOF_EXFAT_TEST_DIR. A FAT32 folder is accepted too; FAT32 has no
hard links either, but its file id across a rename was never measured.
