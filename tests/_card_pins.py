"""Per-card GPU pins: which committed capture describes THIS card.

A bitwise pin of a GPU result is a property of the card as well as of the
code.  Measured 2026-09-17 on a development machine (receipts under
tests/data/receipts/pin-gates/): the phase-2 step builders at one commit
differ between an RTX 5070 Ti (compute capability 12.0) and an RTX 4090
(8.9) in 25 of 27 entries, while an RTX 3080 (8.6) and the 4090 agree bit
for bit, and every other npz pin in the tree (the sina=0 Coriolis pin, the
advection periodic pin, the diff6 base capture, all captured in July 2026
on a box nobody recorded) differs from a 4090 run by ULPs in 3 to 29
percent of its words.  So each pin keeps one file per card, keyed by the
device name cupy reports, and a card with no file SKIPS the bitwise
comparison with ``skip_reason()`` rather than failing for the card and not
the code.  tools/release/precut_gpu_gate.py runs the pins on the release
node's card and names every such skip in its receipt.

Adding a card to a pin is a capture on that card by
``tools/recapture_card_pins.py --pin NAME --write`` (the phase-2 pin by
``tools/recapture_phase2_pin.py --write``), a row in ``PINS`` below, and
the reading the tool prints (against the reference card's file, or the
original capture when no card has one yet) recorded in the ledger of the
test that reads the pin.

The original files (``ORIGINALS``) are the captures the pins were first
made with, on cards nobody recorded; they stay committed as the historical
record and as the file a first per-card capture is read against.
