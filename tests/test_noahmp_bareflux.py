"""Acceptance gate for the WRF v4.6.1 Noah-MP BARE_FLUX transcription.

The bar is max_ulp 0 -- bitwise identity -- against a fixture produced by the
unmodified WRF module (visibility-patched only).  Nothing here relaxes that.

Layout of the evidence:

* :func:`test_fixture_provenance` -- the fixture header still names the pinned
  tree, sha256 and option identity, so a silently regenerated fixture cannot
  slip through.
* :func:`test_bitwise_against_oracle` -- the gate itself.
* :func:`test_branch_coverage_cases_present` -- each branch this lane claims to
  bind has a named case, and the case really does land on that branch
  (asserted through observable outputs, not through the note text).
* :func:`test_negative_controls` and :func:`test_source_mutants_are_all_killed`
  -- deliberately wrong transcriptions that the gate must reject.  A passing
  suite is not evidence unless it can fail.
* :func:`test_min_max_tie_semantics_are_unobservable` -- the one thing this
  fixture provably cannot pin, recorded as a limit rather than hidden.
* :func:`test_mutation_survivors_are_the_expected_dead_arguments` -- the
  mutation study, pinned to the exact survivor set that the pinned option
  identity predicts.
