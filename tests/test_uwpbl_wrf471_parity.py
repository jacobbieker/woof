"""The UW PBL's fixtures of record, and the CPU reference graded on them.

The fixtures (``woof/data/uwpbl/oracle/cases-g35|g44|g61|extra35``, see
PROVENANCE.md there) are WRF v4.7.1's own words: the byte-unmodified
CAMUWPBL sources at gfortran 15.2.0 -O0 on glibc 2.43, six regime families
on 35/44/61 levels (dt 150/60/20 s, four consecutive steps) plus 48
branch-probe columns, each step's exact float32 inputs recorded beside its
outputs.  Pinned here, without a device: the fixture words (sha256), the
saturation table the kernel is given against the one the oracle recorded,
and the binary64 CPU reference ``woof.verify.uwpbl_ref`` against every
output word of every column-step, on a host whose libm is the oracle's.

The product launcher on the card is graded against the same words in
tests/test_uwpbl_launcher_wrf471_parity.py.
