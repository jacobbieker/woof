"""The gray-zone parent chain (P4): config-pair identity pins.

`configs/les_nest_250m_grayzone.toml` is the shipped nested-LES tree with
its 750 m parent moved from YSU to Shin-Hong.  The claim its doc makes --
"any difference between the two runs is the parent closure and nothing
else" -- is only worth making if it is pinned, so this file diffs the two
RESOLVED experiment trees field by field and requires the delta to be
exactly {d02: bl_pbl_physics 1 -> 11}.  All CPU.
