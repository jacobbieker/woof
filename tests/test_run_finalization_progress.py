"""The stretch between the last model step and rc 0 must be visible.

A four-domain 24 h run integrated every one of its 345,600 ticks, wrote
all 484 history frames and its final checkpoints, and then spent minutes
draining writers and SHA-256ing several hundred GiB of those frames into
its success capsule -- publishing nothing the whole time.  The
supervisor's integration watchdog cannot tell that from a hang, so it
killed the worker, restarted from the final checkpoint, and the restore
refused because the checkpoint WAS the stop tick.  A scientifically
complete run reported failure.

These gates hold the finalization stretch to the same rule the
integration loop already lives by: say what you are doing, per unit of
work, on the record the supervisor reads.
