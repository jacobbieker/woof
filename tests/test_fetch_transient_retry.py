"""A source fetch waits out a host that is briefly unavailable.

The breakage: an IFS fetch pinned to the AWS mirror met HTTP 503 on 3 of
its 5 files, gave up after three tries 2 and 4 s apart, and the same
command run 20 s later completed.  Every table source moves its objects
through the one shared retry (:func:`woof.fetch_endpoints.ask_along_ladder`),
so these tests stand a flaky origin up on this computer and fetch two
different sources from it through the real transport.
