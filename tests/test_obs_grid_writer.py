"""The gridded observation products are WRITTEN on the project's Rust by default.

F3 of the 2026-08-18 boundary audit.  ``gpuwm-obs.radar-grid.v1`` and its
satellite twin ``gpuwm-obs.goes-grid.v1`` -- the two files the DA lanes read
and nothing upstream of them -- were both created with
``netCDF4.Dataset(temp, "w", format="NETCDF4_CLASSIC")`` on the bare default
of their doors, under the estate's "writing is not decoding" reading.  The law
says "NetCDF read/write", both words.

These tests pin the flip in the wrfout tape's shape:

* the DEFAULT writes the classic container through
  :mod:`woof.io.nc_writer_bridge`, and reaches netCDF4 for nothing but the
  two character variables the Rust decoder cannot hand back;
* the netCDF4 writer stays reachable ONLY by naming
  ``WOOF_OBS_GRID_WRITER=python``;
* the two engines write the same observation: same inventory, same dimension
  extents, same attributes, and every value bit identical;
* the DA read side consumes what the default wrote.
