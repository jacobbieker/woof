"""The certification path stays generic, and the docs stay derived.

F3-AC12: no case identifier reaches ``woof/certify/**``, the capsule schema,
or any generic identifier, and nothing on the certification import path pulls
in a case module.  The specific temptation is real and named: the case chain
module aliases a sibling case module as ``shared`` and takes ``stable_hash``
from it, so borrowing that helper would put a case module one import away from
every capsule.

F3-AC13: ``docs/public/`` never says "liveness heartbeat", and a statement of
how many pins a receipt covers is counted from the receipt's own key list
rather than typed as a number that stops being true.
