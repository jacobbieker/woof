"""The smallest file the WIF resolver counts as WRF's aerosol climatology.

Every door test that needs "the dataset is staged" used to write a
ZERO-BYTE file, because the resolver asked ``is_file()`` and nothing more.
That made the fixture prove the wrong thing: the precondition admitted an
externally forced mp=28 run whose ingest then died decoding an empty file,
which is a refusal after step 0.  The resolver now decodes the first WPS
intermediate (IFV=5) field record, so the fixture writes one.

It is deliberately the SMALLEST such file (a one-cell field) rather than a
copy of WRF's 225 MB dataset: the property under test is "a candidate that
is structurally the dataset resolves", and the bytes of the real climatology
are the ingest lane's business, not the door's.
