"""The cycling driver's leg boundary, on the CPU.

The driver itself needs a GPU and a prepared case; the card half of the
boundary (a continuous run against two legs joined through the restart
owner, array for array) is ``tests/test_da_cycle_join_gpu.py``.  What is
pinned here is everything the boundary decides without a device: which

# render tool's nest entry points.  The driver now writes the child's
# composite as a wrfout beside its ``.npz``, exactly as it does the
# parent's.  These pin the file that makes that possible; the nested run
# under proof/ is the artifact.
