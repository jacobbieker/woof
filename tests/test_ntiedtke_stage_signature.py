"""``NT_STAGE_SIGNATURE`` is re-derived from the kernel source every run.

WHY IT IS A TABLE AT ALL. The assembler binds each stage's arguments by
NAME -- the workspace resolves a name to a buffer and ``NT_SEEDS`` resolves
the cases where the reference gives one array two names. That needs the
ORDER, and a 709-entry table is only safe to have if nothing maintains it
by hand: a kernel that gains, loses or reorders a parameter would otherwise
be launched with its arguments shifted by one, which CUDA accepts happily
and which reads another array's memory as a float.

So the table is generated from ``ntiedtke.cu`` and this file regenerates it
and compares. It is the same shape as the constant-family gate and the
stage-id gate, and the opposite of the four lists that went stale.
