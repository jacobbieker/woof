"""The GPU pytest shard's list, gated the way the stage-1 list is.

``tools/battery/gpu_shard_files.txt`` closes gap G2 of the 2026-08-13
test-estate audit: **there was no GPU pytest leg at all.**
``stage1_files.txt`` is CPU by construction, ``cargo_gates.txt`` is Rust,
``tiles_gates.txt`` names ``python -m tilestream.*`` modules, and no file
anywhere named a GPU pytest shard.  The consequence the audit measured is
that the entire WRF-parity dycore ran on no list -- 6th-order diffusion
including its boundary faces, both Smagorinsky closures, the open lateral
boundary, the acoustic solver, the mapped mass closure, the TKE budget --
and that ``tests/test_wrfout_conformance.py``, the only file that judges a
woof wrfout with a real WRF reader, is 18 of 18 skipped on a CPU box.

This suite is hermetic and runs on the CPU legs, for the same reason
``tests/test_tiles_gate_manifest.py`` does: a gate that stops existing -- a
file renamed, an entry lost in a tidy-up -- must fail on every commit rather
than at a cut, on the node, when there is no time.

FIRST EXECUTION
---------------
Shard 1 was run for the first time in the project's history on 2026-08-13,
on a rented RTX 5080 (sm_120, driver 595.71.05, CUDA 13.2, NVRTC 13.2, cupy
14.1.1): **314 passed, 1 failed, 6 skipped in 121 s**.  The single failure is
``tests/test_pd_advection.py``'s pre-existing CPU-backend defect, which is
why that file is deliberately on the list.  Shard 2 ran 765 passed in 31 s.
