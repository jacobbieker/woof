"""Replaying an archived window through the nowcast front door.

Pure tests: no network, no GPU, no subprocess execution.  The archive
is a fake that answers the window it is ASKED for, exactly as the real
listing does, so what these tests pin is which window the front door
asks about: the one the caller named, or whatever time it happens to be
when the command is typed.

The last class here drives the WHOLE door with every stage replaced by
a fake that leaves behind the artifacts the next stage reads, so what
the run writes into ``nowcast-receipt.json`` is pinned by reading the
file the door actually wrote.  A block that is asserted only by calling
the function that builds it can be correct and still never reach the
receipt -- which is exactly how the frames block shipped documented and
unobserved.

A replay is the whole point of the fixture: the volumes below exist at
two epochs, the requested window and the day the command is typed on.
A survey that reads the wall clock finds the second set, sites the
domain on weather that has nothing to do with the window, and measures
a motion vector from it.  Nothing downstream can recover from that,
because every later stage takes the domain as given.

Sites here are synthetic ids; real station names never enter the tree's
generic code or its fixtures (standing owner rule).
