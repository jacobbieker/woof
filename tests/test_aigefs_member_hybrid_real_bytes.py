"""The AIGEFS member-hybrid packaged profile, proven on real staged bytes.

The primary is a real AI-ensemble member (0.25-degree, 13 pressure
levels, PDT 1 on every record, NO land-surface state of any kind) and
the contributing source is the same 00Z cycle's physical 0.25-degree
analysis, decoded through the PACKAGED donor mapping.  The composed
decode must materialize the complete WRF-real canonical field set with
the six borrowed fields held at their analysis values and surface
pressure reduced from each lead's own mean-sea-level pressure; a deterministic
file claimed as a member primary must refuse (its PDT 0 comes with the
master and local table versions 2 and 1 that no selector admits); an
ensemble MEAN claimed as a member primary must refuse the same way
(PDT 2) -- the statistic decodes cleanly as plausible fields,
which is exactly why the template pin exists.

Staged inputs (see each staging README for provenance and hashes):
  <staging>/aigefs/mem000.aigefs.t00z.{pres,sfc}.f00{0,6}.grib2
  <staging>/crosssource/gdas.t00z.pgrb2.0p25.f000   (same cycle)
  <staging>/gefs/geavg.t00z.pgrb2a.0p50.f000        (an ensemble mean)

Like the suite's other environmental gates, missing staged data skips.
