"""The ensemble engine's failure modes, each pinned by the case that broke it.

Every test here corresponds to a defect that was reachable in the shipped
engine and is now a refusal, a correction, or a recorded fact.  They are
written against the behaviour rather than the patch: each one fails on the
code as it stood, and none of them widens an existing gate.

The cycling tests use a member runner that implements the REAL integrator's
clock contract -- ``run_seconds`` is the total forecast length from the
experiment start, a restart restores its own elapsed time, and a restart
that has already reached the total is a refusal.  That is the whole reason
the second leg was broken and the reason a runner that ignores the argument
could not see it.
