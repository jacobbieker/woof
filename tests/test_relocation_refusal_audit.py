"""Every accepted control on this branch, refused with a focused test.

CONTRIBUTING asks for "a focused failure test for every new accepted
control".  This file is the audit that found the ones that did not have
one, and it exists because the audit was MEASURED rather than eyeballed.
The four relocation modules carry 87 refusal sites; tracing which of
them the suite actually executes gave:

    before this file   87 sites, 59 exercised, 28 never reached
    after  this file   87 sites, 83 exercised,  4 never reached

Most of the 28 were cheap scalar guards.  One was not, and it is first
below: the earth-fixed compensation bound in ``relocate_child``, which
is the containment leg's own safety clamp -- the check that stops a
parent slide from pushing its earth-fixed descendant out of the frame it
lives in.  It shipped in e1a9f4b7 with nothing exercising it.

THE REMAINING FOUR ARE DELIBERATE, and they are the same four either
way: ``relocate_child``'s SINT-overlap mismatch (:1135) and
parent-changed (:1199) checks, and ``donor_alignment_check``'s two
(:1507, :1514).  Every one is an internal consistency assertion that can
fire only on a defect in this code, never on an input a config can
express.  Provoking one would mean corrupting the very state the gate
protects, and the test would then assert that a deliberately broken tree
stays broken -- which is not evidence about anything.  They are covered
instead by their PASSING side, which every relocation test in this tree
asserts on every move (``donor_alignment_pass``,
``parent_bitwise_unchanged``), and by the 492-check ledger audit over
the real 27.6-hour run.

One test was written for this file and deleted rather than kept: a
mechanical check that every refusal message is "long enough to act on".
Its word-count proxy flagged twenty perfectly good parameter guards
("parent_grid_ratio must be >= 1, got 0" is actionable and is four
words), so it measured prose length rather than usefulness and would
have fought every future contributor.  The audit is the deliverable; a
lint rule with a bad metric is not.
