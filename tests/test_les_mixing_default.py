"""The sub-kilometre closure this product RECOMMENDS must be a stable one.

The anisotropic-K criterion ``mix_upper_bound*(dz_max/dx)^2`` has an
explicit limit of 0.25, and this project's own 250 m LES child reads
0.702 against it -- 2.8x, in the tier where an explicit Laplacian
AMPLIFIES a 2-grid-interval mode in ``w`` rather than damping it.  It is
not a theoretical bound: it came out of a real tornado-run crash traced
to WRF-inherited anisotropic-K instability.

Until this file existed the product handled that with two advisories and
an opt-in remedy, which under "fixed means default" is a workaround
rather than a fix.  The specific hole was that the ONLY place the
product tells anyone how to configure sub-kilometre turbulence --
:func:`woof.domain_wizard.gray_zone_advisory` -- recommended ``km_opt =
3`` / ``km_opt = 2`` with ``bl_pbl_physics = 0`` and said NOTHING about
the mixing length.  ``mix_isotropic`` defaults to 0 (WRF's Registry
value), so a user who followed the product's own printed recipe at 250 m
landed on exactly the exposed configuration, at 0.702, and learned about
it only if they later read stderr at config load.

THE RULING PINNED HERE (REWRITTEN for the 2026-08-16 auto-switch;
the recipe-only ruling it replaces lives in this file's history).  The
remedy is default-on: a domain whose config leaves ``mix_isotropic``
UNSET (or writes ``"auto"``) and violates the criterion runs
``mix_isotropic = 1`` -- resolved once, at the shared experiment load
(``woof.experiment.resolve_auto_mix_isotropic``), announced by one
loud line, repeated by ``woof check``, and named at both restart
doors.  ``tests/test_les_mixing_autoswitch.py`` pins that machinery.
What this file keeps pinning is the boundary the auto-switch does NOT
cross, because each line of it was nearly crossed once:

* An EXPLICIT ``mix_isotropic = 0`` is honoured, danger zone included,
  with the advisory (now carrying the override state).  Refusing at
  load would make the frozen crash records unloadable, which deletes
  the ability to reproduce a committed crash.
  ``test_it_is_still_an_advisory_and_records_load`` holds that line.
* Only UNSET flips, and never silently: flipping a key the user WROTE
  would mutate a physics selector they chose -- and ``mix_isotropic``
  is inside the RunConfig fingerprint ``woof/io/restart.py`` writes as
  ``configuration_sha256``, so the flip is loud and the fingerprint
  consequence is stated where it happens and again at restart load.
* The ``RunConfig.mix_isotropic`` DATACLASS default stays 0, WRF's
  Registry value: code-constructed configs (the frozen verify cases,
  wrapped legacy RunConfigs) mean what their authors wrote, and the
  auto semantics live in the experiment loader where "unset" is
  knowable.

The recipe change (``gray_zone_advisory`` naming ``mix_isotropic = 1``)
stands, and the cost of the remedy is still stated where the remedy is
offered.
