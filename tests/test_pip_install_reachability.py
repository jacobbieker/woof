"""A wheel install can reach the forecast runners.  Nothing else needed.

This is the fast half of the four-command acceptance bar

    pip install recast-woof[all] / woof setup / woof domain / woof go

and it exists because the product's own documented chain used to be
unfinishable from an install: its last two stages were script paths
under ``tools/``, which only a git checkout has, so a pip user could
preprocess a GFS cycle and had nowhere to run it.

What is checked here is exactly the thing that changed: a venv with the
built wheel and NOTHING else -- no checkout on ``sys.path``, no
``PYTHONPATH``, a working directory outside the repository -- can
import and invoke both runners and the ``go`` front door.  Against
shipped 1.3.0 this fails: ``woof.prepared_single_domain_forecast`` does
not exist there, and neither console script is declared.

The whole four-command transcript, including live GFS and a real
forecast, is ``tools/acceptance_pip_install_chain.py``; it needs
minutes, a card and a network, so it is a script rather than a test.
This module is marked ``slow`` because it builds a wheel (tens of
seconds, tens of megabytes) -- it is not marked ``network``: it installs
with ``--no-deps`` from the local wheel and never reaches an index.
