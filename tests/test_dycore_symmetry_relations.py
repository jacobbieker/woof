# tests/test_dycore_symmetry_relations.py
"""Symmetry relations of the dycore operator, asserted as tests.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.  Every dycore gate in this tree proves one of two
things: that the code has not CHANGED (byte-identical replay against
``tests/data/phase2_step_regression.npz``, the pinned kernel source
SHA-256s under ``woof/certify/kernel_manifest.py``), or that it
CONSERVES (``domain_mass_measure`` closing against the boundary
tendency).  A compensating error is invariant under both.  Measured on
this branch, by injecting faults into scratch copies of the kernel
directory: an ``al_pp -> alt`` substitution in the terrain-following
pressure gradient drives an at-rest atmosphere to 108.5 m/s while the
domain mass drift stays at 2.064e-09 -- IDENTICAL to the clean run in
every digit -- and a one-cell shift of the x advection stencil moves the
drift only from 5.251e-10 to 1.470e-09.  A source pin reports that the
kernel changed; it never reports that it changed wrongly.

The relations below are the first assertions in this tree that constrain
the STRUCTURE of the operator rather than its bytes or its integrals.
They come from the symmetry group of the governing equations (space and
time translation, Galilean boost, rotation, scaling; Oberlack, J. Fluid
Mech. 447, 2001), read through the metamorphic-relation framing that
scientific software uses when no oracle exists (Chen, Cheung & Yiu 1998;
Chen et al., ACM Comput. Surv. 51(1), 2018; Kanewala & Bieman, Inf.
Softw. Technol. 56, 2014).  Grid-orientation independence is a standard
dycore test in its own right (Williamson et al., J. Comput. Phys. 102,
1992, cases 1-2 at rotation angles alpha = 0 and ~pi/2); well-balanced
schemes over terrain are the classic terrain-following problem (LeVeque,
J. Comput. Phys. 146, 1998; Klemp, Skamarock & Dudhia, Mon. Weather Rev.
135, 2007).

WHICH RELATIONS SURVIVE THIS DYCORE, AND WHICH DO NOT.

  R1  x-reflection             KEPT   (test_r1_*)
  R2  x<->y transpose          KEPT, e = 0 only (test_r2_*)
  R3  well-balancedness        KEPT   (test_r3_*)
  R4  Galilean boost           REJECTED, and not implemented
  R5  arbitrary-angle rotation REJECTED, and not implemented
  R6  continuous scaling       REJECTED, and not implemented

R4 is rejected on measurement, not taste.  ``advection.cu``'s ``flux5``
carries ``fabsf(vel)``, so the upwind dissipation coefficient is a
function of the advecting velocity and the operator is not linear in it
(Wicker & Skamarock, Mon. Weather Rev. 130, 2002; ARW Tech Note
NCAR/TN-556+STR).  Boosting u by U and comparing against the rest-frame
solution translated by an EXACT integer cell count -- so that no
interpolation enters -- gives max|diff| = 1.157e-02 K at U = 50 m/s
(1.24% of the signal) and 2.188e-02 K at U = 200 m/s (2.35%), four orders
of magnitude above the floor the relations below sit at, and not
converging.  No tolerance for it is derivable from the scheme, so the
test could only assert a number that came from nowhere.  R5 needs
interpolation off the C-grid for any angle that is not a multiple of 90
degrees, which injects more error than it measures; 90-degree multiples
are exactly R2 composed with R1, so R2 is the whole of the recoverable
content.  R6 is broken in the equations themselves by g and the EOS
constants.

WHAT EACH RELATION ACTUALLY CATCHES.  Six faults, each injected into a
scratch copy of the kernel directory and run in a fresh process, at the
configurations these tests use.  "worst" is the largest residual as a
multiple of this file's tolerance, so > 1.00x is a failing test:

  fault injected                R1        R2      mass drift   caught by

  (clean)                    0.19x     0.18x     5.251e-10    --
  x advection stencil +1     7.05x     6.73x     1.470e-09    R1 and R2
  y advection stencil +1     0.21x     6.68x     0.000e+00    R2 only
  flux5 centre pair 2.7e-3   1.33x     0.19x     0.000e+00    R1 only

  flux5 37.0 -> 37.3         0.28x     0.40x     1.050e-10    NEITHER
    (symmetric magnitude)
  Coriolis v-equation f      0.19x    23.85x     6.302e-10    R2 only
    sign flipped

Read that table before trusting either relation.  Three things in it
matter.

  * The two relations are COMPLEMENTARY, not redundant.  A y-only stencil
    error is invisible to an x-mirror and a purely x-directed asymmetry is
    invisible to a transpose; each relation catches a fault the other
    misses.
  * R1 is a PARITY grading test, so it is blind to any fault that
    preserves the grading.  Flipping the sign of a whole term does
    preserve it -- ``+f*<rv>`` and ``-f*<rv>`` are both odd under the
    mirror -- which is why the Coriolis sign flip sits exactly at R1's
    floor and is caught by R2 instead.
  * Every one of the six faults leaves the conservation gate green.  Two
    of them give a mass drift SMALLER than the clean run's.

WHAT NONE OF THEM CAN SEE.  All four measured.

  * Reflection and transpose see ASYMMETRY, not MAGNITUDE.  A symmetric
    coefficient error in the flux5 stencil (37.0 -> 37.3) sits at the
    floor in both, and so does a scaling of the Coriolis f.
  * The detection threshold is about 1e-3 relative stencil asymmetry.
    Sweeping the flux5 centre pair: 2.7e-4 sits at the floor at 20, 60 and
    120 steps; 2.7e-3 is caught.  That threshold is set by ``typedef
    float real`` in ``common.cuh`` -- the whole dycore is FP32 -- not by
    the test design.
  * Identity map factors mean the ``vxgm`` / msf-gradient code is NOT
    covered: with msf = 1, ``vxgm`` is identically zero.  Real-data
    Lambert map factors are outside all three relations.
  * Periodic boundaries only.  Nesting, and the open and specified
    boundary branches, are outside all three.

PRIOR ART IN THIS TREE, and why it is not enough.
``woof/verify/cases/straka.py`` already asserts a self-symmetry relation
(``symmetry_err = max|thp - thp[:, :, ::-1]|``, gated at 0.05 K).  That
gate is left exactly as it is by this file, deliberately: it covers one
field, one case, one time level, in 2-D (ny = 1), dry, non-rotating,
flat, and it only runs in the case battery.  It is also a SINGLE-run
relation, which is why it can only be posed for f = e = 0 -- a symmetric
state is not preserved by a rotating operator.  Tightening it toward the
floor measured here is a separate decision with its own evidence.

COST.  Thirteen relation instances, 32^3 x 60 steps, about 8 s of GPU
wall on an RTX 3080 plus the cupy import.  Cheap enough to sit in the
ordinary ``-m gpu`` pytest run rather than the case battery.

# R3 -- WELL-BALANCEDNESS AT REST
# =======================================================================
#
# BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS: a base-state quantity used where a perturbation
# quantity belongs, inside the terrain-following horizontal pressure
# gradient.  That is the classic terrain-following defect: the large
# horizontal gradient of the BASE pressure across a sloping coordinate
# surface stops cancelling, and the scheme spins motion out of a resting,
# hydrostatically balanced atmosphere.  Measured, by substituting the
# total inverse density ``alt`` for the perturbation ``al_pp`` in
# ``pgrad_face`` (acoustic.cu): the at-rest residual goes from 1.163e-03
# m/s to 108.5 m/s over a 2000 m hill, while the domain mass drift stays
# at 2.064e-09 -- identical to the clean run in every digit.  The
# conservation gate is structurally incapable of seeing this, and a
# byte-identity gate certifies it forever once committed.
#
# THE GATE IS THE HEIGHT-INDEPENDENCE OF THE RESIDUAL, NOT ITS SIZE.
# Clean, across a 200x range of hill height, the residual does not move:
#
#     h0 = 10 m    |u|max = 1.115e-03   |w|max = 1.489e-03 m/s
#     h0 = 500 m   |u|max = 8.774e-04   |w|max = 1.536e-03 m/s
#     h0 = 2000 m  |u|max = 1.163e-03   |w|max = 1.620e-03 m/s
#
# That is FP32 cancellation.  Under the injected metric defect the same
# sweep gives 5.570e-01 / 2.807e+01 / 1.085e+02 m/s -- a ratio of 194.85
# across a 200x change in slope, which is the signature of the defect
# itself.  An absolute threshold would have to sit loose enough to admit
# the clean round-off bath and would therefore admit a real
# slope-proportional term as well; the ratio separates them.
# ``woof/verify/cases/hill2d.py`` records the same round-off-excited
# noise bath independently (w RMS ~ 3e-4 m/s).
#
# WHAT R3 CANNOT SEE, and the reason is worth knowing before anyone
# extends it: in the ARW perturbation-form pressure gradient EVERY term of
# ``pgrad_face`` is a product involving a perturbation quantity, so at
# rest the whole gradient is analytically zero and scaling any one of its
# coefficients multiplies zero.  Scaling the base-geopotential half of
# the metric term by 1e-4, 1e-3 and 1e-2 was injected and none of the
# three moved the residual at all.  Well-balancedness is a STRUCTURAL
# property of this discretization; what R3 catches is a change that
# breaks the structure, not one that perturbs a coefficient.
