"""The carrier contract's produced-at ledger survives the streamed sweep.

THE DEFECT THIS PINS (2.0 blocker, measured on the streamed real-case
twin): the freshness law (woof/core/radiation_carriers.py,
``CarrierContract.check_before_consumption``) reads WHO wrote each
radiative carrier and WHEN, off the consuming driver's own contract.  A
resident run has one driver for the whole forecast, so the radiation
seam's restamp (physics.py, ``_run_radiation``) accumulates naturally.
A STREAMED run rebuilds tile buffers -- each with its own driver, each
stamped at the buffer's local t=0 -- and restored only the clock and the
call counters onto them (``tilestream.physics_inventory
.set_carrier_scalars``).  The produced-at ledger never rode along, so a
fresh ``TiledRun`` at domain hour N consumed hour-N fields under stamps
from buffer birth: the twin died at model second 3620 with "GLW ...
last wrote it at model second 0 ... tolerance 260 s", first surface step
of its second wrfout frame, while the resident arm ran the full six
hours and every frame both arms produced was bit-identical.  Radiation
WAS running; only the ledger was silent.

The fix threads the contract through the same round trip the clock
already takes: ``carrier_scalars`` carries ``CarrierContract.state()``
(plus the policy), ``set_carrier_scalars`` restores it through
``merge_carrier_records``, the sweep's clock epilogue publishes it, and
the streamed checkpoint header carries it exactly as restart.py's does.
Every case here is CPU-hermetic: a real ``CarrierContract`` on a stub
driver, no device, no cupy.

RED-ON-REVERT: ``roundtrip_heals_the_hour_boundary_refusal`` is the
defect in one function -- revert the ``carriers`` entries out of
``carrier_scalars``/``set_carrier_scalars`` and it raises the exact
CarrierContractError the twin log shows.
