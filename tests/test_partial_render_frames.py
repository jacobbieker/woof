"""A frame whose renderer failed partway is not a finished frame.

The breakage: the renderer draws temperature, fails on wind and exits 1.
The early render and the as-it-lands render both published the one
picture it drew and recorded the WHOLE frame as done, with no warning, so
the end-of-run render skipped the frame and wind was never drawn.  Each
frame now carries the renderer's exit and the products it drew; a nonzero
exit keeps the good pictures, warns, and leaves the frame for finalize,
which draws it again.
