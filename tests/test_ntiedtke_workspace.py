"""The assembler's workspace, and the proof that its boundary grade can fail.

WHY THE LAST PART MATTERS MOST (review). The assembler establishes each
stage's level-indexing base by GRADING rather than by declaring it, because
three static derivations gave three different answers (docs/ntiedtke/PORT-RECORD.md
§32). That design rests entirely on the grade being able to fail.

The mechanism to rule out is **bind-and-read symmetry**: if the read-back
used the same base as the bind, a wrong base would shift the write and
unshift the read, the comparison would pass, and the array would be left
mis-indexed relative to whatever the next stage expects. The grade would be
measuring the round trip instead of the binding -- the harness-agrees-with-
itself shape that has cost this port five instances.

It cannot happen here, and not by care: :meth:`NtWorkspace.levels` always
returns the same rows of the allocation regardless of base, so the read-back
is base-independent **by construction**. ``test_a_wrong_base_fails_a_real
_boundary_grade`` demonstrates it on a graded kernel rather than arguing it.
