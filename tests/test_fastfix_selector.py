"""The fast-fix lane's selector, and the list it cannot select.

``tools/battery/fastfix.py`` decides which suites a change has to run before
it is published.  That makes it a thing that can be silently wrong, which is
the exact failure mode the 2026-08-13 test-estate audit was chartered to
find -- a gate that reports green while measuring nothing.  A selector with
no gate of its own would be the audit's own finding, rebuilt.

So this file pins the two properties the audit's validation established, in
both directions:

* a real defect commit must still be caught (``6e9c690f0`` ->
  ``tests/test_pd_advection.py``), and
* a change the selector structurally cannot analyse must fall back to the
  ALWAYS list rather than selecting nothing.

plus the manifest hygiene on ``tools/battery/always_files.txt``, in the
shape ``tests/test_stage1_manifest.py`` established for the stage-1 list.
