"""A boundary cadence a door accepts is one the preparation takes.

``woof domain --cadence N``, the ``[fetch]`` table's config-load check and
``woof fetch`` each accept a cadence and write it into the run: the fetch
downloads that ladder and the companion namelist carries it as
``interval_seconds``.  The decode then holds the fetched series to the
packaged mapping's ``target.boundary_interval_seconds``.  When the two
disagreed the doors said yes, the whole window was downloaded, and the
decode refused it.

These tests hold the doors and the decode to one answer, read from the same
packaged mapping, for every source whose preparation is a packaged mapped
profile.
