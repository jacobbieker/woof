"""A land surface with no radiation at all: the guard, and the sky it gets.

Provenance, 2026-08-09, found by execution.

The 1.7.1 nocturnal guard tests ``ra_sw_physics > 0 and ra_lw_physics
== 0``.  A suite with BOTH streams off walks past it -- and
:func:`woof.core.physics.initialize_physics` computes
``radiation_active = bool(ra_lw_physics or ra_sw_physics)``, so in that
case it attaches no radiation adapter at all.  Nothing ever writes
``fields["glw"]``.  Noah (``woof/core/noah.py``), Noah-MP
(``woof/core/noahmp_runtime.py``) and RUC (``woof/core/ruc.py``) read
it on every surface step regardless, so the whole run's downward
longwave was the constructor's seed -- which was ``300.0``, a plausible
clear-sky number that looked like a measurement in every wrfout it
reached, on the same argument line whose ``swdown`` was already ``0.0``.

Two things changed, and this file pins both:

1.  THE NUMBER -- or rather, the absence of one.  There is no seed at
    all: ``initialize_physics``' ``glw`` argument has NO DEFAULT, and a
    longwave-off run whose land surface reads GLW is REFUSED rather than
    filled (``woof.core.physics._resolve_initial_glw``).  That is
    stronger than replacing 300.0 with WRF's zero, which is what this
    lane originally did: WRF's zero is accurate about being nothing, but a
    surface budget closing against zero is still not a forecast, and a
    default of any value is a number the caller did not choose.  A run
    that genuinely wants a fixed sky types it -- and says so in the
    config, with :data:`CONSTANT_DOWNWARD_LONGWAVE_ACK`, which is a
    SECOND and separate declaration from this file's own token.
2.  THE GUARD.  A real experiment (it has a ``[projection]``) that runs
    a land-surface model with both radiation streams off refuses to
    load unless it declares
    :data:`RADIATION_OFF_LAND_SURFACE_ACK`.

Both directions, always: the negative controls below are what say the
guard does not fire on the legitimate cases, and they are bound to the
positive case so that a tree where the guard was never wired in fails
them rather than passing them.
