"""The as-posted fetch against a local replay of a posting cycle (A136 L2).

A local HTTP server serves one cycle's objects of a real table route and
reveals lead ``k`` only once an injected clock passes its reveal time, so
the loop is driven exactly as a live cycle drives it: asked by the
polling rule, fetched the moment one host holds the whole lead, verified,
and published as a per-lead marker in lead order.
