"""The as-posted fetch against a local replay of a posting cycle (A136 L2).

A local HTTP server serves one cycle's objects of a real table route and
reveals lead ``k`` only once an injected clock passes its reveal time, so
the loop is driven exactly as a live cycle drives it: asked by the
polling rule, fetched the moment one host holds the whole lead, verified,
and published as a per-lead marker in lead order.

    when another file failed the request after its retries, a worker
    waiting for a later lead slept its wait out, and the pool, which waits
    for its jobs to wind down before it raises, raised only then: no
    ``failed.json``, the preparation still waiting on the failed lead, and
    the other workers still downloading.  Reproduced on a development machine: the
    request raised after the 20 s posting wait instead of at 0.5 s.  The
    wait now ends on either stop: the request's (``TransferCancelled``,
    e4224502f) and the chain's (``FetchStopped``)."""
