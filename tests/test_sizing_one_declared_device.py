"""One declared card, one device, wherever the estimate is asked for.

``woof domain --card N`` sizes a configuration, writes it, and then runs
``woof check`` on the file it has just written.  Both doors price the
same file against the same declared card and the same declared budget,
and they disagreed: 13.73 GiB from the wizard against 14.72 GiB from the
check, one of them inside the 14.54 GiB budget and the other 0.18 GiB
outside it, so the wizard emitted a configuration its own check refused
with exit 4.

The whole difference is ONE term.  :func:`estimate_experiment` resolves
an absent card to the measured reference device profile before it prices
the non-pool terms and the per-scheme column workspaces, because a
declared card is a named reference device and not an unknown one.  The
shared legacy-RRTMG chunk workspace read the RAW argument instead, so
the wizard -- which declares a card rather than measuring one, and
therefore passes no profile -- priced that workspace for an unknown
device while every other number on its own page was priced for the
reference device.

An unknown device is not the conservative answer here.  The shortwave
chain has no ceiling: with no device it takes a fixed no-device width,
and the 170-SM reference device saturates WIDER than that width.  So the
unknown-device answer is the narrower workspace and the optimistic
envelope, which is the direction
:func:`card_local_memory_profile` promises never to take.
