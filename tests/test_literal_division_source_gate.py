"""A146 gate, source layer: no float division by a constant outside __fdiv_rn.

The breakage this prevents: NVRTC's NVVM, for compute_100 and compute_120
(every Blackwell card: RTX 5090, 5070 Ti, PRO 4500, PRO 6000) under
``-ftz=true`` (which CuPy appends to every ``RawModule``), compiles
``x / C`` for a compile-time constant ``C`` as ``x * RN(1/C)``.  That is not
IEEE division: on an RTX 5070 Ti with NVRTC 13.4, exhaustively over every
float in [1, 2), ``x / 3.0f`` is one ULP off for 33 percent of inputs,
``x / 60.0f`` (the advection flux) for 65 percent, ``x / tgammaf(4.0f)`` for
33 percent, while compute_90 and older keep ``div.rn`` and round correctly.
``__fdiv_rn(x, C)`` is never rewritten and is the IEEE quotient on every
card, so it is the one spelling a kernel may use for such a division.

This file imports neither CuPy nor NVRTC, so it runs on every leg, the CPU
legs that set ``GPUWM_NO_LOCAL_GPU`` included (tools/battery/always_files.txt
lists it).  The compiler census, which sees divisors a source scan cannot,
is tests/test_literal_division_gate.py on the GPU shard.
