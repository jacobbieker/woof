"""``--chain`` past three nests: the 12 km -> 250 m LES ladder.

The program's stated objective is a ladder that starts on a synoptic
root and lands on a large-eddy-permitting inner nest -- 12 -> 3 -> 1 ->
0.5 -> 0.25 km, four nests.  Until this file existed the wizard died on
that ladder with a bare ``IndexError: tuple index out of range``: two
per-depth constants tabulated at the certified FOUR-domain layout's
depth were indexed by nest depth with no bound.

* ``_CHILD_SPAN_FRACTION`` (3 entries) -> ``_dims_for_scale`` raised at
  the FOURTH nest, before anything had a chance to refuse politely.
* ``_DIFF6_FACTORS`` (4 entries) -> ``_domain_tables`` raised one nest
  later, so fixing only the first moved the traceback rather than the
  defect.

Both now clamp to their innermost certified entry, which is the defined
behaviour: a nest deeper than the tabulated ladder inherits the tightest
proportion and the weakest sixth-order damping that were ever certified,
rather than an undefined one.  Nothing here relaxes a refusal -- a nest
that genuinely cannot be hosted inside its parent with the boundary
clearance still raises :class:`DomainFitError` with a message that names
the extent, and the fit loop still prices every candidate.
