"""The soil-layer count is a property of the selected land-surface scheme.

WRF resolves ``num_soil_layers`` from ``sf_surface_physics`` rather than
honouring the namelist: ``share/module_check_a_mundo.F`` subroutine
``set_physics_rconfigs`` (:3546-3577) overwrites it per scheme and calls
``wrf_error_fatal`` on a scheme with no entry.  Noah and Noah-MP share
``init_soil_depth_2`` (4 layers, fatal at anything else,
``share/module_soil_pre.F:1128-1151``); RUC uses ``init_soil_depth_3``
(:1153-1194), which tabulates zs for 6 and for 9 and is fatal at 4 or 5.

What this file gates, in the order the numbers travel:

1. :func:`woof.config.soil_layer_count` resolves from the SCHEME, and refuses
   a request the scheme does not define -- including the case that used to
   pass silently, a RUC config whose ``num_soil_layers`` was left at the
   ``RunConfig`` default that belongs to Noah.
2. No soil-layer count is written into ``LAND_SURFACE_SOIL_LAYERS``.  Checked
   over the source, because the point of the table is that it holds *no*
   literal -- neither the old 4 nor a new 9 -- and an equality assertion
   against the scheme constants would still pass if someone typed the numbers
   back in.
3. The VRAM preflight sizes soil arrays from the resolved count.  This is a
   correctness bar, not an estimate: this hardware corrupts near capacity and
   has no ECC, so an understated preflight is a silent wrong-answer machine.
   Measured cost of the old behaviour on a 120x100 domain: the four soil
   arrays were sized (4, 100, 120) instead of (9, 100, 120), understating the
   physics category by 960,000 bytes per domain.
4. wrfout writes ``soil_layers_stag`` at the resolved count and the NetCDF
   reads back at that shape.
5. A four-layer configuration is pinned unchanged, including the writer
   default that stands in for "no land-surface scheme selected".

RUC is still refused as *executable* by
``woof.physics_compat.pending_wrf_physics_components``; that is a separate
gate and this file does not touch it.  Every ``RunConfig`` here is therefore
built directly rather than through :func:`woof.config.load_config` -- which
is also the path that made the old silent-4 reachable, since direct
construction runs no validation at all.
