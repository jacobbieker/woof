"""One `--valid-time`, two meanings: the collision and its resolution.

``--valid-time`` shipped on the two HRRR entry points the wizard prints,
and they read it differently:

* ``tools/prepare_hrrr_wrf.py`` treats it as the CYCLE -- it opens
  ``hrrr.tHHz.wrfnatfNN.grib2`` with that hour and adds the lead to get
  model time zero;
* ``woof/hrrr_hierarchy_direct.py`` treats it as MODEL TIME ZERO -- it
  is compared to the namelist's ``start_*`` keys and to the sealed
  cache's ``initial_valid_time``.

At lead 0 those are the same instant, which is why four releases never
noticed.  At lead K the wizard handed the same string to both and one of
them was wrong by K hours.

The resolution: **the typed time is always the cycle** (``--cycle``), and
model time zero is always derived from it and ``--forecast-start-hour``.
``--valid-time`` stays accepted on each command with exactly the meaning
it had in v1.4.0 THERE, so a v1.4.0 script keeps working; passing both is
refused rather than ranked.
