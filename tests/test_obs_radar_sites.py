"""The radar site inventory, and the refusal that keeps it accurate.

The whole point of this module is one behaviour: a site with no antenna
elevation is refused rather than assimilated. Most of this file is that
behaviour, approached from both directions -- it must fire on the shipped
inventory, and it must stop firing the moment an elevation is supplied.
