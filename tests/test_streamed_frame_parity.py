"""The parity instrument, tested against known answers in BOTH directions.

An equality checker that always answers "equal" passes every parity gate
ever written, and this project has produced confident wrong results that
way more than once.  So these tests do not merely check that two identical
files compare equal: they seed FOUR corruptions, one for each class of
defect the 2.2.0 cut actually found or could have found, and require the
instrument to catch each one.

  * a dropped variable      -- the OLR defect, exactly
  * an added variable       -- its mirror, which is equally not parity
  * one flipped float bit   -- the UP_HELI_MAX class, 1 cell, ~1 ULP
  * one changed attribute   -- the carrier-provenance defect

The files here are written with netCDF4 directly rather than by running a
forecast: what is under test is the COMPARISON, and a fixture that needed
a card could not run in the CPU battery where regressions get caught.
