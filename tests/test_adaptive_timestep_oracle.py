"""Grade :mod:`woof.core.adaptive_timestep` against the WRF ``calc_dt`` oracle.

The oracle is ``tools/calc_dt_wrf_oracle/calc_dt_oracle.csv``, produced by
``run_calc_dt.F90`` -- upstream's ``calc_dt`` compiled verbatim against
WRF's own ESMF time manager (``external/esmf_time_f90``, libesmf_time.a),
swept over 1728 (max_cfl, target_cfl, max_increase_factor, last_dt)
combinations that cross every branch and both quantisation ties.

The comparison is on the EXACT RATIONAL, ``out_S + out_Sn/out_Sd``, not on
the REAL(4) image -- the interval is the controller's state and a float
comparison would hide a one-part-in-100 numerator error.
