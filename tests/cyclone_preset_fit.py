"""Whether a source's declared window can hold the cyclone preset's root.

Shared by the cyclone door tests that walk every source.  A regional source
smaller than the 200x160 root at 12 km (ICON-D2 covers about 1,200 by
1,500 km) cannot carry it anywhere: the door refuses it by name at every
centre and lists the sources that can, so no configuration is emitted for
the other checks to read.  Both walks decide that from the row's own
window, never from a source name.
