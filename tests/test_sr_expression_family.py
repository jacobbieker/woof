"""The SR validator's shared-expression roundoff family (1.9.1 D2).

Shipped 1.9.0 granted the proven WRF positive-sum SR roundoff envelope to
``mp_physics=6`` alone, while wdm6.cu:672 forms SR with the IDENTICAL
expression as wsm6.cu:406 -- so a healthy WDM6 real case died on its own
validator at the first frozen-dominated column (accepted_updates=5 on the
reference case), reporting WRF expression-order behaviour as a defect.

The fix keys the envelope on SHARED-EXPRESSION FAMILY membership
(woof/core/physics.py::_SR_EXPRESSION_FAMILY_STEP_SCALINGS and
``_sr_roundoff_envelope``), audited over every kernel that writes SR:
wsm6/wdm6 (identical accumulated expression), milbrandt2 (same quotient
once per call), morrison (order-dominated, provably <= 1.0, excluded),
NSSL (outside the range check by contract, excluded).

This suite pins the family's membership and the 1-ULP-above-1.0 case in
both directions: red under a zero-ULP envelope (the shipped 1.9.0
behaviour), green under the family envelope.  The real-case route proof
is the reference-case twin run, which must survive past
``accepted_updates=5`` where 1.9.0 died.
