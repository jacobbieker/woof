"""The commit gate must FIRE, and nothing ever checked that it could.

``tools/ntiedtke_wrf461_oracle/check_no_forecast.sh`` refuses a commit
while a forecast is running, because any commit changes ``git_commit`` in
the run's identity and kills it at completion.

On 2026-08-29 it reported ``safe to commit`` over a live 14-hour run at
87%.  It matched only the command line, and the run had been launched
through a wrapper script that imports the entry point rather than naming
it in argv -- so none of its three patterns appeared.  The process was
``python.exe`` and WAS returned by the query; only the match missed.

That is the sixth matcher-matches-nothing in this tree and the first with
a live cost.  It is also the only one where nothing ever asserted the
matcher FIRES: every test here is that missing control.
