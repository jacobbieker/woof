"""The schedule executor walking a VARYING step_ticks.

Nothing sets an adaptive dt in production yet.  What is gated here is the
executor's half of it: that ``execute_schedule`` can be driven by a period
source which re-expands one root step at a time at whatever step the
controller just chose, and that the invariants the fixed walk asserts --
parent/child tick-exact sync, the FORCE lead, boundary alignment -- still
hold when the step changes underneath it.

The arms are compared directly: with a controller that changes nothing,
the adaptive walk must produce EXACTLY the fixed walk's op sequence and
counts.  That equivalence is what makes the varying cases evidence about
the step rather than about the walk.
