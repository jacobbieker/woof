"""``tools/dual_run_screen.py`` classifies, and it still bites.

The screen is the standing corruption detector on a card with no ECC, so
it has three ways to be worthless and this file pins all three.

It can cry wolf.  It did: a completed dual run whose 151 history files
were byte-identical and whose 5092 final-state digests agreed was
reported as a CORRUPTION FINDING because six allocator high-water
numbers -- maxima over a 50 ms background poll, not model state --
disagreed between the arms.  The chain stopped and no deliverables were
produced from a run that was fine.

It can also go blind, which is worse and is the failure mode a fix for
the first one invites: widen the exclusion to "the memory block" and the
screen stops comparing a whole block of real run properties.  So the
tests below check the exclusion is SCOPED -- an observed high-water is
excluded, a computed estimate sitting beside it in the same block is
not -- and that an excluded key which disagrees is still PRINTED.  An
exclusion nobody can see is indistinguishable from a screen that never
looked.

And it can say PASS on nothing, which is the worst of the three because
it looks exactly like the good outcome.  Seven separate arrangements --
no receipts, unreadable receipts, a receipt only one arm wrote,
receipts under different names, zero-byte history files, a receipt with
no digest in it, and the same directory handed in twice -- each printed
``DUAL-RUN SCREEN: PASS (bit-identical)`` with ``final-state digests
compared: 0``.  A corruption detector that greens on an empty
comparison is not a weak detector, it is a false one, and every one of
those seven is pinned below as a REFUSAL.  The positive control sits
beside them: a genuinely bit-identical pair still passes, and now says
how much it compared to get there.
