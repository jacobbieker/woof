"""A non-zero surface-call interval is opt-in, and it stays opt-in.

Noah-MP's host column cost makes ``bldt = 0`` -- a land-surface call on every
dynamics step -- unaffordable on the finest nest.  A longer ``bldt`` is the
single largest lever available, worth 36x at ``dt = 1.667 s``, and it was
authorised for Noah-MP specifically.  It is a **cost mitigation with a measured
forecast impact, not a physics recommendation**, and the authorisation came
with a constraint: it must not become permanent, and no future configuration
-- or future reader, human or model -- may come to treat it as normal.

The failure mode being guarded is inheritance, not authorship.  ``bldt`` is in
``allowed_parameter_keys`` for the domain-tree runner route, and every registry
template carries a ``parameters`` dict that routes merge in.  One
``"bldt": 1.0`` in a template would therefore propagate to every configuration
built from it, silently, with no author ever having typed it.  That is the
thing this gate exists to prevent.

So the rule is narrow and positional:

* the ``RunConfig`` dataclass default is ``0.0`` and stays ``0.0``;
* the registry's generic ``parameters["bldt"]["default"]`` is ``0.0``;
* **no registry template may mention ``bldt`` at all** -- not zero, not
  non-zero.  A template is the inheritance vector, so the gate refuses the key
  outright rather than refusing a value;
* no runner route may supply a ``bldt`` default (routes may *allow* it as an
  explicit per-run override; that is what ``allowed_parameter_keys`` is);
* a config file may carry a non-zero ``bldt`` only if it is named in
  :data:`OPT_IN_CONFIGS` **and** carries :data:`JUSTIFICATION` verbatim in the
  comments attached to the assignment.

The last clause is why this is not merely a lint.  The justification travels
with the value, in the file, where the next reader finds it.

A gate that only ever passes is not evidence of anything, so the real-tree
assertions are paired with scratch-tree negative controls that inject each
violation into a copy and prove the checker reports it.
