"""The mp=50 restart-identity contract, as gates rather than as a document.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
----------------------
The concrete breakage, and it has happened twice: a scheme-specific knob
lands on :class:`woof.config.RunConfig` WITHOUT a row in
:data:`woof.core.model.SCHEME_SCOPED_RUN_FIELDS`, so it enters
``restart_identity_payload`` for EVERY domain of EVERY experiment,
including runs that never select that scheme.  ``experiment_fingerprint``
is that payload plus the input catalogue, so every previously written
checkpoint refuses to resume -- for a field nothing in its trajectory
ever read.  The NSSL five did it at the 1.9 assembly; the mp=28 aerosol
pair did it at the 2.5.8 integration (fixed in ``62ce7c3f6``).

MEASURED 2026-08-28, when these tests were written:
``SCHEME_SCOPED_RUN_FIELDS`` carried schemes 16, 18 and 28 and no others,
and ``RunConfig`` held ZERO P3 fields.  The tests were set as a trap ahead
of the first one rather than after a fingerprint had already moved.

THE TRAP HAS SINCE SPRUNG, correctly, which is the useful part of the
record: ``p3_backend`` is on ``RunConfig`` now and
``SCHEME_SCOPED_RUN_FIELDS[50]`` carries it, so the scoped row exists and
the off-scheme refusal below covers it.  Read the paragraph above as the
state these gates were built against, not as the current inventory.

WHAT EACH TEST GUARDS
---------------------
* :func:`test_no_scheme_prefixed_run_field_is_unscoped` fires the moment a
  ``p3_*`` (or ``nssl_*``, ``wdm6_*``, ``mp28_*``) field is added to
  ``RunConfig`` without its row.  It has a mutation control beside it.
* :func:`test_every_scheme_scoped_field_is_refused_off_scheme` is what
  makes the scoping PROVABLY LOSSLESS: dropping a field from the identity
  discards no information only if that field can hold nothing but its
  default under any other scheme.  It runs over the table, so a scheme-50
  row inherits the requirement automatically the day it is added.
* :func:`test_the_p3_restart_contract_string_is_the_measured_configuration`
  pins the mp=50 algorithm-identity string against the Fortran facts each
  of its tokens claims.

      Measured: at nCat=1 the multi-category table 2 is never opened (the

      table 1 version ``5.4_2momI`` (:138, :161).

      between this row and the unported mp=51.
    * ``diagnosed-ssat`` -- ``log_predictSsat = .false.`` is hard-coded at
      :2252, so ssat/sup/supi are diagnosed from ``qv_old`` and ``qvs``
      each step (:2333-2336), which is what makes ``th_old``/``qv_old``

    and not the file digest.  It is accurate -- the file is byte-identical
    through v4.8.0 -- but it would not move if a future WRF changed the
    file while keeping the release name in our comment.  Correcting it
    means moving the string, which moves the algorithm identity, which
