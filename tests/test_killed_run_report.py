"""A killed run says what it was doing, and still dies of the same signal.

The report that produced this file was one word long::

    $ woof run configs/run60.toml --outdir out/run60
    woof run: woof 2.6.0 -- installed wheel at .../site-packages/gpuwm
    Terminated

``Terminated`` is the shell, not woof: bash saying its foreground job
died on SIGTERM.  The package installed no handler anywhere -- the only
two signal references in it were a *read* of the SIGINT disposition in
``woof/cli.py`` and the MCP job canceller's outbound ``killpg`` -- so
the signal hit both woof processes at ``SIG_DFL`` and they died with
nothing printed.  The reader could not tell whether it was their config,
their card, their data, or a woof crash, and the one file that would
have said (``out/run60/worker-01.stderr.log``) they did not know existed.

What this file pins:

* both front doors of a supervised run install the report -- the parent
  the shell waits on AND the worker that holds the forcing and the card;
* the report names the phase from the run's own ``run-progress.json``,
  the host RSS at that instant, and the worker log;
* the signal is re-delivered, never swallowed: a run killed by SIGTERM
  still dies of SIGTERM, and a Ctrl-C still reaches the
  ``KeyboardInterrupt`` contract ``woof/cli.py`` turns into exit 130;
* an ignored disposition is left ignored, because a shell that
  backgrounded the job masked it on purpose (the same reasoning as
  ``tests/test_interrupt_contract.py``);
* the device leg reads CuPy's own pool counters and never ``memGetInfo``,
  which would stand up a CUDA primary context inside a signal handler on
  a box that just ran out of memory.
