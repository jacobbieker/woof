"""ACCEPTED IMPLIES CHECKPOINTABLE: every admitted scheme can be NAMED.

WHAT THIS PREVENTS, concretely and measured on 2026-09-10 07:39Z: a
single-domain ERA5 forecast configured with ``mp_physics = 9`` -- a value
``validate_run_config`` accepts and ``woof/core/milbrandt2.py`` integrates
-- ran for 59 minutes and then died writing its first hourly checkpoint
with

    RestartManifestError: cannot identify unsupported microphysics
    scheme 9

because ``MICROPHYSICS_ALGORITHM_IDENTITIES`` had no row for it.  The
forecast was lost.  Nothing earlier in the run asked whether the
checkpoint writer could name the scheme, so nothing earlier could refuse.

Two rungs are held here.  The first is the TABLES: for every scheme id
each registry declares implemented, the identity table that a checkpoint
resolves it through has a row.  The second is the GATE: the question is
asked at plan review, by ``validate_run_config``, on a bare default
configuration with no flag to set -- so a configuration that could not be
checkpointed is refused before any device work instead of an hour into
the forecast.

A THIRD rung was added on 2026-09-10: WHERE the tables live.  The gate is
called from ``validate_run_config``, and ``woof/config.py`` ships in
distributions that stage no ``woof/io`` -- the standalone RW-WPS
preprocessing project stages ``woof/*.py`` plus a named handful of
``woof/io`` modules, and ``restart.py`` is deliberately not one of them.
Reading the gate out of ``woof.io.restart`` therefore made plan review
itself unimportable there.  The tables and the gate now live in
``woof.checkpoint_identity``, which imports neither ``woof.io`` nor
CuPy, and ``woof.io.restart`` imports the same objects back under the
names the tree already spells -- so a table is monkeypatched at its
definition below, and the re-export is asserted to BE that object rather
than a second copy that could drift from it.

CPU-only: identity tables and configuration validation, no runtime.
