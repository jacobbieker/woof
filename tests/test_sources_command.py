"""``woof sources``: the human door onto the source registry.

Two defects are guarded here, both of them the same law -- a refusal
must name a remedy the reader can actually take.

**The refusal named a command that does not exist.**  A registered but
not-runnable source asked for through ``woof fetch --source X`` refused
with ``see: `woof sources` for what each registered source can do
today.``  There was no ``woof sources``: the real parser answered
``invalid choice: 'sources'`` at exit 2, so the one sentence a stuck
reader was handed sent them to a dead end.

**The registry had no human door at all.**  The same facts were
reachable only as ``woof run-plan --sources``, a JSON query flag on the
machine-facing execution front door.  Handing a person who just hit a
refusal a JSON query is not a front door (ship-only-what-users-can-reach),
so the command in the sentence is the one that now exists.

Everything the command prints is COPIED from the registry document
``woof.runplan.source_inventory`` builds.  There is no second table and
no branch on a source id, which is what keeps adding a model to table
work: the graft cell below appends one row to the registry and expects
it in the printed listing with no edit here or in the renderer.
