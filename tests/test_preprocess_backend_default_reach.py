"""Bare-default preprocessing must reach the CPU backend without cupy.

The 2.5.0 persona walks measured the gap this file pins: the prep doors
defaulted ``--preprocess-backend`` to ``cuda``, so a CPU-only install
died mid-preparation in ``RuntimeError: CuPy is required for GPU
horizontal interpolation`` -- while ``--preprocess-backend cpu`` walked
the same route to completion, and ``woof doctor --explain`` promised
that the whole preprocessing half runs without cupy.  A capability that
only a flag can reach is a workaround, not a fix (fixed-means-default).

The fixed contract:

* the three prep front doors default to ``auto``;
* ``auto`` resolves to the CPU backend when CUDA is unusable and prints
  ONE line saying so and why;
* ``cuda`` typed explicitly on an install with no cupy is a NAMED
  refusal at resolve time -- what is missing, the install line, and the
  flag that runs the same preparation on the CPU -- never a bare
  RuntimeError from the first kernel that went looking.
