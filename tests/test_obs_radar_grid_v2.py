"""radar-grid v2: velocity on each radar's reach window, and v1 still readable.

v1 stored every radar's velocity plane over the whole analysis domain.  A
radar sees a disc ~250 km across and a continental grid is ~5000 km
across, so at 49 bytes per cell per radar that layout is 715 GB for a
160-radar CONUS analysis and ~99% of it zeros.  v2 stores each plane on
that radar's reach window with the window's origin beside it, which is
~8.9 GB for the same network -- the difference between needing a
supercomputer's memory and fitting on rentable hardware.

Nothing else changes.  Every field, unit and meaning is v1's; reflectivity
is not windowed at all, because it merges across radars into one field the
whole network contributed to and was never the problem.

What this file pins:

* v1 files STILL READ.  Receipts recorded the sha256 of v1 files, and a
  receipt whose file can no longer be opened is a dead receipt.  This is
  the property a schema bump is most likely to break and the one it can
  least afford to.
* a v2 file carries bit-identical observations to the v1 file written from
  the same merge -- checked field by field through the whole-domain view,
  with a guard that the windows really were smaller than the domain;
* the adapter produces bit-identical LETKF batches from either;
* fail closed: a window that under-covers its radar, or falls off the
  grid, is refused by the writer and by the reader.
