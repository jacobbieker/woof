"""The chunk sizing and degradation path, on the device it exists for.

The CPU-side arithmetic and driver are pinned in
``tests/test_letkf_chunk_sizing.py``; this module asserts the parts that
only mean something with a card present: the free-memory reading, the
ceiling holding on a real analysis, and the degradation path fired by the
device stack's own exception classes rather than by look-alikes.

    And the degraded answer is checked to ROUNDING, not to the byte.
    The host-side twin of this test asserts bitwise equality and is right
    to: numpy's batched eigensolve and matmuls are per-matrix loops.  The
    device's are not -- cuBLAS and the batched eigensolver choose work
    partitionings from the batch extent -- so re-solving the same span at
    a smaller chunk reorders each gridpoint's sums.  Measured here on an
    RTX 3090 (sm_86, cupy 14.1.1, float64): 2.2e-16 absolute at chunk 16,
    rising to 3.1e-15 at chunk 1, on increments of order one.  The
    tolerance below is 1e-12, four orders above the worst measurement and
    still nine orders below any increment this filter produces, so it
    admits reordering and nothing else.  If this ever needs loosening,
    the degradation path has become an accuracy path and the loosening is
    the bug report.
