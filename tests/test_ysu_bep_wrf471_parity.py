"""YSU's flag_bep arm (sf_urban_physics 2/3) against WRF v4.7.1.

``tools/urban_wrf471_oracle/run_ysu_bep.F90`` calls ``bl_ysu_run`` from the
byte-unmodified ``phys/physics_mmm/bl_ysu.F90`` at MMM-physics
``20240626-MPASv8.2`` with ``flag_bep = .true.`` on the 24 columns of the
shipped v4.6.1 YSU fixture, each carrying a BEP forcing set shaped like the one
``module_sf_noahdrv.F:1679-1720`` hands the PBL.  This module runs
``launch_ysu(..., bep=..., frc_urb2d=...)`` (``ysu_column_bep``) on the same
inputs and pins the measured distance.

That ``bl_ysu.F90`` differs from the v4.6.1 copy the non-BEP kernel was
transcribed from by exactly one line (``we(i) = 0.`` at :605, which the
kernel's zero-initialised ``we`` already is): every flag_bep expression is
identical in the two tags.

**The numbers are a measurement, asserted for equality** (the
``tests/test_ysu_wrf461_parity.py`` convention): the BEP arm inherits the
non-BEP kernel's CUDA-libm residue (expf/powf/cbrtf are CUDA's in ysu.cu, not
glibc's), so it is not bitwise, and a change in either direction must be
stated in a commit.

Reference arm.  WRF's own driver always passes ``ctopo = ctopo2 = 1``
(``module_bl_ysu.F:404``) and in that arm :1313 removes the urban fraction of
the surface drag.  ``ysu.cu`` carries the ctopo-absent form of ``ad(1)``, so
its BEP arm spells that removal on ``fric`` directly; it is graded against the
ctopo arm (what WRF does), and the WRF-against-WRF distance to the ctopo-absent
call (where WRF removes nothing) is pinned too, to show the arm matters.

Which WRF.  woof carries ONE declared divergence in this arm
(``tests/test_ysu_bep_rural_drag.py``): :1313 removes only the urban
fraction of YSU's own drag while the BEP couple already folds the rural drag
into ``a_u_bep``, so WRF counts the rural surface drag twice; ``ysu.cu``
removes the whole of YSU's own drag.  The port is graded against
``ysu_bep_fix/columns``, WRF built by
``tools/urban_wrf471_oracle/build_ysu_bep_fix.sh`` with exactly that one
change (the ``frc_urb1d(i)*`` factor dropped from :1313).  The stock build,
``ysu_bep/columns``, still reproduces byte for byte from the same script and
stays here as the record of what WRF does: the two differ in the u and v
tendencies of the columns that are not wholly urban and nowhere else.
