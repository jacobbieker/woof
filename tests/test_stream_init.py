"""``--stream-init``: the flag, and the pricing rule ``auto`` decides on.

Everything here runs with no card.  That is not a convenience -- it is the
point of the split between :func:`_stream_init_pricing` (arithmetic over
three integers) and :func:`_free_device_bytes` (the only part that needs a
device).  The rule that decides whether a 16 GB card can hold a prepared
domain must be testable on a machine that does not have one, or it is a rule
nobody can check until it has already refused a forecast.

The instrument is tested in BOTH directions, per the house rule: a domain
that fits must choose resident, a domain that does not must choose store, and
the boundary between them must sit where the constants say it does rather
