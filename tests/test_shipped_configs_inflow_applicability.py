"""No shipped config may seed inflow turbulence it cannot run.

``inflow_perturbation`` takes its vertical extent from the PARENT's
diagnosed PBLH, so a parent running ``bl_pbl_physics = 0`` has nothing
to define it with and the generator refuses.  That is the mechanism's
applicability boundary and it is ratified as G4 in
``docs/superpowers/specs/P6-LES-DECISIONS-RATIFIED-2026-08-05.md``: ON at
the first LES domain under a PARAMETERIZED-turbulence parent, OFF below
it, because a PBL-off parent is itself LES and its RESOLVED eddies
already ARE the child's inflow turbulence.

The refusal was real and it worked -- G4 records it killing the G5 LES
smoke twelve seconds after the tree reached the card.  What did not work
is WHERE it lives: at ``NestCoupler`` construction, downstream of a
fetch, two preparations and a whole prepared tree, for a fact that was
legible in the TOML the whole time.  So a config shipped tripping it
(``les_tornado_100m_dodgecity_20160524.toml``, whose d04 sits under a
PBL-off d03) and nothing in either tree noticed.

This file is the durable half of that fix: the sweep is the test, and
the config edit is one instance of it.  Everything here is CPU-only.
