"""The receipt must carry the gate's evidence, not ``null``.

CROSS-LANE FIXTURE LAW.  Every existing supervisor test feeds ``_analyse``
a HAND-BUILT report with a nested ``"ingestion"`` key, and they all pass.
The shipped producer -- :func:`woof.cycle.engine.build_replay_parent_engine`
-- returns the FLAT ``verify_ingestion`` block instead, so
``report.get("ingestion")`` was ``None`` on every real run: the gate never
ran inside the supervisor and the receipt said ``"ingestion": null`` about
the most important gate in the system.  That is exactly how the evidence
looked missing to a reader.

So these tests drive the supervisor with the OTHER side's REAL writer
output.  They are behaviourally red on revert: the receipt's ``ingestion``
is ``None`` and the assertion on the three hashes fails.  No ImportError
is doing the work here.
