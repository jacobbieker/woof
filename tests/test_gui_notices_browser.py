"""The notice line under the header says what just happened, on the page the person is looking at.

The defects this file holds shut:

- My forecasts put up "The page lost touch with the server." when a read
  of the forecasts folder failed and never took it down once the server
  answered again, so a page back in touch kept saying it was not. Its
  reads once cleared the whole line after every good answer, which also
  cleared the line a start had just left there.
- A read of the forecasts folder that failed after the person had left My
  forecasts put that same line on the page they had gone to, where nothing
  takes it down.
- Queue it on Review set "Queued in place 1. ..." and then opened My
  forecasts, and drawing that page cleared the line before anyone saw it.
  The same happened to the line that says a queued forecast waits for its
  start to be published, the only place that says so when it is queued,
  and to "Started. Opening the Watching page." after Start. The start's
  line is now set once the page it opens is drawn, and My forecasts' own
  reads must leave it there.

The page runs in headless Chrome (or Edge) against the real page server;
the engine is a stand-in, so no forecast runs.
