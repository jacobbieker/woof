"""The ASOS surface adapter, against the real seam and the real filter.

Three authorities are exercised and none is imitated:

* the RECORD is the real ``rw_asos`` writer's own output over a subset of
  a real archived IEM fetch (``tests/fixtures/asos_surface_real``, see its
  README for the provenance chain), and when ``WOOF_RW_ASOS`` names a
  binary the decode is re-run against the committed CSV and compared:
  the reader is tested against the other lane's writer, never against a
  fixture its own lane typed;
* the GRID is a real WRF Lambert projection over the stations, so
  placement goes through the same ``mass_index``/``inside`` authority the
  radar path binds to;
* the FILTER is the real :func:`woof.da.letkf.analyze`, because the open
  question the scout left, does a k = 0-only batch behave under the
  vertical stencil, is only answerable by running it.

Everything here is CPU/numpy.
