"""A streamed ``[tiles]`` domain consumes Davies forcing on the BOUND clock.

Task #219.  Every production driver-forced root binds a ``DomainClock`` to
its external LBC mirror (``woof.core.model.build_experiment``,
``woof.prepared_domain_tree_forecast``, ``woof.offline_child_run``), which
switches Davies consumers to WRF's post-increment ``dtbc`` recurrence
(``dt .. T_bdy``).  ``woof.core.streaming.make_tile_hook`` converts every
tile buffer to ``attach_streaming_lateral_boundaries``, and until this task
that conversion silently DROPPED the binding: the buffers fell back to the
retired ``elapsed - interval.start`` path (``0 .. T-dt``) and the streamed
run consumed its lateral boundaries one timestep late.  Measured on the
offline child at t+15 min: 41 of 76 wrfout fields differed, W by
0.0043 m/s against a 0.174 m/s field, constant one-step phase error.

WHY THE EXISTING GATE MISSED IT: ``tilestream/test_join.py`` binds no clock,
so BOTH its arms took the retired path and agreed.  These tests bind the
production clock through the PRODUCTION builder
(``streaming.standalone_domain_builder`` -- the exact object
``woof.offline_child_run`` and ``woof go``'s d01 step with), so the blind
configuration can never again be the only coverage:

* ``test_clock_bound_streamed_matches_resident`` is the red-on-revert
  regression: bit-identity with the clock bound on both arms.
* ``test_unbound_arms_still_agree`` pins the legacy compatibility path
  (direct era5/gfs routes without a DomainClock) to bit-identity, so the
  fix provably did not move the unbound semantics.
* ``test_dropped_binding_is_visible`` is the tripwire: the defect's exact
  shape (bound resident, unbound streamed) MUST differ, which proves this
  instrument can see the defect class at all (a zero-tendency forcing
  would quietly disarm both tests above).
* ``test_streamed_refresh_publishes_driver_diagnostics`` is the second
  finding of the same investigation: ``StreamedDomain.refresh_state``
  copied only the carrier manifest, so output-only driver diagnostics
  (``OLR`` at every shipped rung) published as zeros through the
  ``state_frame`` route while the store held the sky the tiles computed.
