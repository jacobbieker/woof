"""A cancel and the job's own wrapper both publish result.json at once.

Seen on a Linux node: the manager's cancel and the wrapper it had just
signalled wrote the same "result.tmp"; the first replace took the other's
file and the cancel raised FileNotFoundError, so Stop failed.  The
interleaving is made here on purpose: the wrapper's write lands between the
manager's write and its replace.
