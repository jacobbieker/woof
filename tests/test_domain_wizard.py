"""``woof domain`` wizard gates: sizing fit, round trips, edge rejects.

The wizard owns no memory arithmetic and no projection math of its own,
so these tests bind its glue: emitted configs load through the REAL
experiment/case-data loaders, their estimator envelope fits the declared
card budget, the companion namelist.wps agrees with the [projection]
table through the real grid builders, and every documented refusal
(pole containment, bad cycle, missing budget) fails loudly with an
actionable message.  Worldwide contract: the projection is
auto-selected by |lat| (mercator < 25 <= lambert <= 60 < polar),
both hemispheres emit, and antimeridian-crossing footprints produce
wrap-aware (W > E) fetch boxes instead of refusals.

    Two BUDGETS in one command's output was the earlier mechanism. This
    is two PRICES: the wizard sized the HRRR 12/3 km ladder on a declared
    16 GiB card at a 13.73 GiB peak envelope, inside the 14.54 GiB budget
    it printed, and the `woof check` it then runs on its own output
    priced the same file at 14.72 GiB and refused it, exit 4. One
    command, one file, two prices, and a shipped door that refuses what
    it just wrote. Measured against the 2.7.5 wheel from PyPI as well as
    the branch, so it reached users.

    The mechanism was a guard that outlived its defect.
    ``estimate_experiment`` priced the legacy shortwave chunk workspace
    with ``resident_threads=0`` whenever the caller handed no device
    profile, which ``rrtmg_sw.sw_batch_column_chunk`` reads as "no
    device" and answers with the fixed no-device width. That answer
    equalled the reference profile's until c5f942ad128 (2026-09-15)
    retired the 2,048-column ceiling and made the width the device's own
    saturation width. `woof check` fills an absent profile from
    ``card_local_memory_profile``; the estimator's own legacy branch did
    not, so the two halves of one command stopped agreeing.

    THE SECOND MECHANISM, and the reason this test now reads the printed
    numbers rather than the exit code alone. An exit code of 0 says only
    that the two prices landed on the same side of the budget. They were
    still two: the loop sized the ladder at the producer's own 3,600 s
    boundary cadence and printed `peak envelope 13.74 GiB`, and the check
    read the emitted file, found no `cadence` key in the `[fetch]` table
    that producer's fetch does not take, fell back to the 21,600 s
    constant and printed `forecast needs 13.69 GiB` -- for a file whose
    own emitted namelist.wps says `interval_seconds = 3600`. The schedule
    read now answers the producer's published cadence when the file
    carries no other one, so both doors price the file at the cadence it
    will be prepared with and the command prints one number.

    Asserted as the PROPERTY, not the number, and to the BYTE: an
    estimate for a declared card is the same estimate whether or not the
    caller spells the reference profile out, and the estimate at the
    cadence the emitting loop sized against is the same estimate as at
    the cadence the verifying read returns, because those are what the
    verifier does. Two non-vacuity assertions keep the equalities from
    holding for want of a difference to find.

    ``ra_physics`` only when a split key was ABSENT.  The aggregate
    radiation option states the split keys as -1 and the pair in the
    combined key, so that read called a fully RTE+RRTMGP suite
    "radiation off" the first time the wizard offered one.  The premise
    is now asked of ``radiation_scheme_ids``, which is the reader every
    door uses, so the two cannot disagree again.
