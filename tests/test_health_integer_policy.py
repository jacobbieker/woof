"""Every integer field a routed scheme collects must carry a device policy.

``StateHealthValidator._refresh`` classifies each collected descriptor by
dtype.  float32 is checked; int32 is checked only if the field name carries an
explicit range policy, or skipped only if it carries a documented exclusion;
anything else raises.  That refusal is deliberate -- an integer field silently
admitted to a float32 gate would be compared against reinterpreted bit
patterns -- but it is also a *launch* failure, not a compile failure, and it
fires at ``require_healthy(phase="initialized-or-restored")``, i.e. after
static, after ingest, after the device state is built and before step one.

MYNN found that edge.  ``surface.ktop_plume`` is int32 and was in neither set,
so a MYNN 5/5 forecast died at initialization on *every* domain, single or
nested -- observed on the real d01 geometry through ``python -m woof.cli run``
before this file existed.

So the tests here are about the *policy*, not about MYNN.  They rebuild the
real production inventory on the host for every routed PBL / surface-layer /
LSM combination and classify it through the shipped
``woof.core.health.gpu_integer_policy``.  A future scheme that adds an int32
field with no policy fails here, at ``pytest`` time, instead of at minute one
of somebody's forecast.

NO DEVICE IS OPENED
-------------------
``woof.core.state`` and ``woof.core.physics`` are bound to NumPy for the
inventory tests, and the arrays they produce are asserted to be
``numpy.ndarray``.  The device tests are marked ``gpu``.

Noah-MP had the identical defect in two fields, ``surface.isnowxy`` and
``surface.pgsxy``, found by this sweep rather than by a forecast.  Both now
carry range policies read off the pinned WSL WRF tree, and the second half of
this file is their evidence.

#: checkout.  Pinned so a sweep that silently shrank cannot pass by
#: measuring less.  Re-measured 2026-07-30: the WRF-owned MYNN/RUC and
#: MYNN/Noah-MP pairings increase the admitted matrix from 19 to 21.
#:
#: Re-measured again 2026-07-30 for the v1.3.1 wave: 21 -> 33.  The
#: combination lane made WRF v4.6.1's own PBL/surface-layer table the
#: admission authority and it admits three pairings ArWen used to refuse
#: under the (too broad) "MYNN half suite" story:
#:
#:   (bl_pbl=0, sf_sfclay=5)   PBL off with MYNN surface
#:   (bl_pbl=5, sf_sfclay=1)   MYNN PBL with revised MM5 surface
#:   (bl_pbl=5, sf_sfclay=91)  MYNN PBL with classic MM5 surface
#:
#: Each is legal for all four routed land-surface values {0, 2, 3, 4},
#: so the admitted set grows by exactly 3 x 4 = 12.  The complement is
#: unchanged and still accounts for the whole 4 x 4 x 3 = 48 product:
#: 11 refusals with the surface layer off (its one admitted member is
#: the all-off (0, 0, 0)), plus the 4 remaining WRF-fatal
#: (bl_pbl=1, sf_sfclay=5) rows -- 15 refused, 33 admitted.
#:
#: Re-measured 2026-08-03: 33 -> 41, because the gray-zone lane made
#: Shin-Hong (``bl_pbl_physics=11``) routable and never re-measured this
#: pin.  It is lane bookkeeping and not a release-line movement: 33 is
#: IDENTICAL at ``cf159eb2`` (the shipped 1.5.1), ``cfcfa9a9`` (the
#: pre-merge lane tip that added the route) and ``61488333`` (the merge).
#: The whole +8 is scheme 11's own admitted slice, and nothing else moved:
#:
#:   sfclay {1, 91} x lsm {0, 2, 3, 4} x pbl 11  ->  8 admitted
#:   sfclay {0, 5}  x lsm {0, 2, 3, 4} x pbl 11  ->  8 refused
#:
#: Shin-Hong inherits YSU's surface-layer pairing exactly, which is the
#: point: WRF v4.6.1's own table admits it with the revised and classic
#: MM5 surface layers and refuses it with the surface layer off and with
#: MYNN's, and the refusal names that authority verbatim ("WRF v4.6.1
#: PBL/surface-layer compatibility ... WRF v4.6.1 refuses this pairing").
#: pbl=1 measures the same 8 admitted / 8 refused split at this checkout.
#:
#: Measured whole rather than as a delta, the sweep is now the
#: 4 x 4 x 5 = 80 product of the routed selectors:
#:
#:   admitted 41 = 13 (pbl 0) + 8 (pbl 1) + 12 (pbl 5) + 8 (pbl 11)
#:                  + 0 (SASE)
#:   refused  39 =  3        + 8        + 4        + 8        + 16
#:
#: The "4 x 4 x 3 = 48" above was already one axis behind before this
#: lane: SASE's routed ``pbl900`` selector had made the product 64.  The
#: 33 it explained stayed correct anyway, because SASE is admitted with
#: no surface-layer value on this probe's reference config (it wants
#: km_opt=0, which ``_config`` does not set), so it contributed 16
#: refusals and zero admissions.  Scheme 11 is the first PBL addition
#: since that actually lands in the admitted set.
#:
#: MYJ RE-MEASURE, 2026-08-09 (lane/port-myj).  This port routes TWO new
#: selectors at once -- sf_sfclay_physics=2 and bl_pbl_physics=2 -- so the
#: product goes 4 x 4 x 5 = 80 to 5 x 4 x 6 = 120, and the admitted count
#: is re-measured, not projected:
#:
#:   admitted 45 = 13 (pbl 0) + 8 (pbl 1) + 4 (pbl 2) + 12 (pbl 5)
#:                  + 8 (pbl 11) + 0 (SASE)
#:
#: MYJ's own 4 is one per land-surface value at the single surface layer
#: it admits, which is what a PAIRED scheme looks like on this axis:
#: every other PBL here spreads over two or three surface layers, and MYJ
#: over exactly one (module_physics_init.F:3770-3772).  The 4 new
#: sfclay=2 cells under the other PBLs are all refused by
#: validate_myj_pairing, which is the reverse half of the same law.

#:
#: **Empty, and it has to stay a measurement rather than a waiver.**
#:
#: It previously held ``surface.isnowxy`` and ``surface.pgsxy``, on the

#: ``d66e442`` with ``phys/noahmp`` initialized at ``848f54ad``, and it is the
