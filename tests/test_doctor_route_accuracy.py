"""``woof doctor`` may not report a component ``ok`` it never exercised.

Two findings from the 2026-08-14 reachability audit share one root:

* ``grib2_inventory`` and ``grib2_dump`` are staged by ``woof
  fetch-bridges``, probe-executed by doctor, and printed ``ok`` -- on a
  box where ``woof-mapped-inspect`` dies with ``NotADirectoryError:
  [WinError 267]`` because ``mapped_source._build_grib2_tools()`` shells
  ``cargo build`` into a directory a wheel does not contain and never
  looks at the staged copies.  Two true statements about the FILES, and
  a false one about the ROUTE.
* ``rw_mrms``, ``rw_stage4`` and ``rw_asos`` are resolved and refused by
  ``woof/obs/frontdoor.py`` and are in NO bundle, so doctor -- which
  audited exactly the bundled set -- printed a fully green estate on a
  box where all three observation front doors were absent.

The rule these tests hold: where a check cannot exercise something, it
says ``untested`` and its detail opens with "not tested".  Never ``ok``,
and never silence.
