"""The AI-GEFS mirror's re-encoded archive prepares, and nothing else does.

The AWS mirror serves part of the AI-GEFS archive under another GRIB
writer's octets.  From 2026-01-11 00Z to 2026-04-08 06Z every message
carries PDT 0 (no ensemble octets), master table 4, local table 0 and
generating process 255; from 2026-04-08 12Z to 2026-04-24 12Z the
ensemble octets survive (PDT 1/11) but the generating process is 255.
Before these declarations the mapping pinned PDT 1 on every selector,
so a whole PDT 0 cycle matched nothing ("0 of 177 GRIB message(s) ...
match this mapping's selectors"), and the member verifier refused both
forms before any decode.

The fixtures are whole production envelopes of those cycles (provenance
and SHA-256 in the corpus README): the 100 m wind pair of the 2026-01-20
00Z mem000 and mem001 sfc f000, which are the same bytes in both members
because nothing in them names a member, the mem000 file's mean-sea-level
pressure record (centre 7 where its neighbours carry 74), and the 100 m
wind pair of 2026-04-10 00Z, whose perturbationNumber survived.  Every
fact is read through the real Rust inventory and both mapped engines.
