"""The duplicated staggered face of a periodic domain equals face 0.

An x-staggered array on a doubly periodic domain carries ``nx + 1`` slots
for ``nx`` distinct faces: the last one IS the first one, wrapped.  Every
consumer that destaggers to cell centres reads
``0.5*(u[..., nx-1] + u[..., nx])`` for the last mass column, so a
duplicate slot that stops being written does not crash and does not go
non-finite -- it quietly makes the domain's last column read a wind from
whenever the slot was last touched.  A 4-GPU fork carried exactly that
defect, and the question of whether mainline shares it (task #143) was
answered by a 1,200-measurement probe on node 3: mainline is CLEAN, the
identity holds at exactly 0.0 in FP32 while the slot itself travelled up
to 2.03 m/s.

That was a probe against an installed 1.8.7 wheel and it left with the
run.  This is the mainline pin, in the shape the probe used:

* the face arrays are found BY STRUCTURE -- every ``cupy.ndarray`` on the
  state whose trailing extents are ``(ny, nx+1)`` or ``(ny+1, nx)`` -- so
  an array a later lane adds to ``DomainState`` is covered the day it
  lands, rather than the day someone remembers to extend a hand-list;
* the identity is asserted EXACTLY, not to a tolerance, because the
  duplicate slot is computed from the same wrapped mass-point indices as
  face 0 and any difference at all is a different code path;
* a counterfactual says how far the slot moved, so a frozen field cannot
  pass as a held identity;
* and a poison control proves the assert can fire, run after the
  integration so the detector is exercised on evolved arrays.
