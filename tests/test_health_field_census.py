"""The health-descriptor ceiling, measured rather than projected.

``woof.core.health.collect_state_fields`` auto-walks ``driver.fields``, so
every admitted scheme adds descriptors against a fixed ``MAX_HEALTH_FIELDS``.
The cap is enforced INSIDE ``collect_state_fields``, which a forecast first
calls on a synchronized boundary -- after allocation, after ingest, after the
run has started.  So a configuration over the cap is not a configuration that
fails to launch; it is a configuration that dies mid-forecast.

Nobody was measuring it.  What existed were two projections, each obtained by
multiplying a single-domain delta by four (~196, and ~707 of 1024 "about 69%").
Both measure a quantity that does not exist: the cap is applied per
``DomainState`` (``model.py`` builds one ``StateHealthValidator`` per domain,
passing no ``extra_tables``), and the ROOT and a CHILD are structurally
different inventories, so neither one times four is anything.  The tests below
instantiate the real four-domain configuration and count.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL
---------------------------
A ceiling nobody measures is one a user discovers mid-forecast.  The sweep
here is the measurement, and it re-runs on every suite invocation, so a scheme
admitted next month is counted whether or not its author thinks about this
file.

TWO TIERS, AND WHY THE `slow` REFUSAL WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE WRONG NUMBER
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This paragraph used to read "It is deliberately NOT marked ``slow``: a gate
that is routinely deselected is the situation this task was created to end.
It costs about 65 s."  The instinct is correct and is preserved.  The number
was not: the 2026-08-13 test-estate audit measured the file at **541 s**, and
a re-measurement on this branch at **461 s** -- eight times its own
documented cost, on the most expensive file in the battery, because nothing
in the project measured test cost and the fast/slow split was maintained
from stale prose.

So the ceiling gate is still never deselected.  It runs on every merge, in
Tier A, over the neighbourhood of the recorded peak: the three COUPLED axes
(LSM x PBL x surface layer) swept in full against each other, the three
independent axes swept one at a time, about 92 combinations for **25 s**,
re-deriving the 632 peak instead of reading it back.

The exhaustive 2,560-combination sweep is Tier B, marked ``slow``, and runs
at the cut.  It is what finds a peak that has moved somewhere Tier A does not
look.  Neither arm is a substitute for the other and both are named as such
in each test.

  A one-axis-at-a-time reduction was implemented first and REJECTED by
  measurement: it predicts 527 on mp18-lsm0-pbl0-sfclay0-cu0-km1 against the
  real 632 on mp18-lsm3-pbl5-sfclay5-cu1-km1, because LSM, PBL and surface
  layer interact through the WRF pairing table (RUC retains MYNN's
  fractional sea-ice result for the post-LSM blend, worth 31 descriptors
  that none of the three carries alone).  A fast gate that is quietly 105
  descriptors optimistic is worse than a slow one.

NO DEVICE IS OPENED
-------------------
The sweep runs in a fresh subprocess, which is what lets the census bind
``cupy`` to NumPy before any woof module can capture a device handle -- and
which incidentally exercises the shipped CLI rather than a re-implementation of
it.  This module imports no cupy, directly or in a subprocess.

#: Peak per-domain descriptor count over the whole selectable cross-product.
#: Re-measured 2026-07-26, the first measurement since b682ef3 made the census
#: unrunnable: ``woof/core/mynn_pbl_gpu.py`` built three
#: ``cp.ReductionKernel`` objects at module import, and the census's
#: fail-closed host backend has no such symbol, so every run of this file
#: errored out and 601 was a number nobody could reproduce.  The kernels
#: are now built on first use and the
#: sweep runs again.  601 -> 570 was a DROP, and it was not an improvement in
#: the inventory: Noah-MP left the SELECTABLE set.  ``woof/physics_compat.py``
#: refused ``sf_surface_physics=4`` above the host-era 352-column ceiling, and
#: d01 is 50,000 columns, so every one of the 240 ``lsm4`` points in the
#: cross-product carried that refusal and no ``lsm4`` row was measured at
#: all.  The four ``lsm4`` rows that had held the peak were gone.
#:
#: Re-derived independently 2026-07-27 before this number was written down,
#: because a predicted measurement is not a measurement.  With the 352-column
#: ceiling the sweep returned 230 measured rows and 730 refusals against a
#: 960-point cross-product (5 x 4 x 3 x 4 x 2 x 2), all 240 ``lsm4``
#: refusals naming ``Noah-MP column budget (sf_surface_physics=4,
#: columns=50000)``, and a control run with
#: ``WOOF_NOAHMP_EXPERT_COLUMN_BUDGET=360000`` returned 290 rows, 670
#: refusals, and 601 at root 229 on exactly the old four-way tie -- proof
#: that the 570 peak was the old peak made unreachable, not shrunk.
#:
#: 2026-07-27, LATER THE SAME DAY: the slab orchestration's timing runs
#: moved ``NOAHMP_MEASURED_COLUMN_CEILING`` to its measured 360,000 (see
#: woof/physics_compat.py), so Noah-MP is selectable on every domain of
#: this case again and the control's prediction became the measurement:
#: the re-run sweep returns 290 measured rows, 670 refusals, **601 at root
#: 229 on exactly the old four-way tie**, and NO refusal anywhere in the
#: report names the column budget (the 180 remaining ``lsm4`` refusals are
#: 60 MYNN/Noah-MP pair, 60 MYNN half-suite, 40 LSM-without-surface-layer
#: and 20 km_opt=4/pbl0, every one predating the budget).
#
#: Re-measured 2026-07-30 after the WRF-owned MYNN/RUC and MYNN/Noah-MP
#: pairings became selectable: 396 measured rows, 756 refusals, and 632 at
#: root 260.  The 31-descriptor increase is RUC's retained MYNN fractional
#: sea-ice surface-layer result, which is required for WRF's post-LSM blend.
#:
#: Re-measured again 2026-07-30 after the complete WRF v4.6.1 pairing
#: table replaced the reciprocal half-suite and PBL-off diffusion gates:
#: 792 measured rows, 360 refusals, and the same 632/root-260 peak.  The

#: is pbl5 (MYNN), so km_opt=3 is not selectable here -- for exactly the
#: reason km_opt=2 never was.  The measured peak did NOT move: still 632,

    """Why 570 became 601 again, as a gate rather than as a comment.

    From 573939c to the slab orchestration, ``validate_run_config`` handed
    the readiness authority ``columns=nx*ny`` and the authority refused
    ``sf_surface_physics=4`` above the host-era 352-column ceiling, so
    every ``lsm4`` combination was out of the selectable set at d01's
    50,000 columns and the peak read 570.  On 2026-07-27 the ceiling moved
    to the slab path's measured 360,000 (woof/physics_compat.py), every
    domain of this case fits under it, and the peak went back up to 601 --
    the outcome the previous revision of this test named as correct, and
    the number its ``WOOF_NOAHMP_EXPERT_COLUMN_BUDGET=360000`` control
    had already measured.

    Pinned three ways, because each one on its own could be true for the
    wrong reason: the ``lsm4`` slice is measured again and at its recorded
    size; NO refusal anywhere in the report names the column budget (this
    case has no domain wider than the measured ceiling, so a budget refusal
    here would mean the ceiling and the measurement drifted apart); and the
    ``lsm4`` refusals that remain are exactly the pre-budget reasons, so
    the rise is Noah-MP returning and not some validator quietly loosening.
    If a wider case ever enters this census, the budget rail is expected to
    speak again -- for the width nothing has measured, not for this one.

    Re-pinned 2026-07-30: 60 -> 72.  The v1.1 any-combo registry expansion
    made mp_physics=18 selectable in the lsm4 slice; the re-run census
    measures a uniform 12 rows per MP across {0, 1, 6, 8, 10, 18} where
    the 2026-07-27 census had five MP values, and the worst-count peak is
    unchanged at 601 (pinned by the test above).

    Re-pinned later on 2026-07-30: 72 -> 96.  The WRF-owned MYNN/Noah-MP
    pairing adds four rows per MP (cu 0/1 x km_opt 1/4) and retires exactly
    the corresponding 24 pairing refusals.  The remaining 192 refusals are
    the unchanged surface-layer-off, MYNN half-suite, and PBL-off diffusion
    gates.

    Re-pinned for Lane C: 96 -> 192 measured and 192 -> 96 refused.
    WRF's complete 12-cell PBL/surface-layer table admits MYNN PBL with
    revised/classic MM5 surface layers and PBL-off with every represented
    surface layer, while vertical_diffusion_2 retires the km_opt=4/PBL-off
    rail.  The 96 remaining lsm4 refusals are exactly 72 WRF-fatal pairing
    rows and 24 WOOF structural surface-layer-off rows.

    Re-pinned for the LES lane, 2026-08-02: every count below is EXACTLY
    1.5x its previous value -- rows 792 -> 1188, rejected 360 -> 540, the
    lsm4 slice 192 -> 288, lsm4 refusals 96 -> 144 -- and nothing else
    moved.  ``selectable_scalar_values`` PROBES validate_run_config rather
    than transcribing it, precisely so it tracks the validator; the
    validator now admits km_opt=3, so the turbulence axis went from
    {1, 4} to {1, 3, 4} and every slice grew by exactly one third of its
    new size.  The lsm4 slice measures a uniform 96 rows per km_opt value.

    km_opt=2 is deliberately absent: the probe replaces one scalar on the
    REFERENCE config, which runs bl_pbl_physics=1 (YSU), and km_opt=2 is
    admitted only with the PBL off.  So the census sees three turbulence
    options here, not four, and would see km_opt=2 only on a PBL-off
    reference.

    Re-pinned on the 1.5 integration line: three independent movements
    land at once, and every count is their exact product.  The LES lane's
    x1.5 (turbulence axis {1, 4} -> {1, 3, 4}) and the mp=28 route's x7/6
    (microphysics axis grew from 6 to 7 selectable schemes -- the mp28
    lane never re-measured this census, so its movement surfaces here)
    give rows 792 -> 1386 and WRF-side rejections 360 -> 630; the SASE
    closure adds 448 rejections of its own (32 per (km_opt, mp) cell x 2
    x 7), all km_opt refusals, and zero measured rows.  lsm4: 224 rows
    (112 per km_opt value), 112 WRF-scheme refusals (Lane C's 96 carried
    across the axis growth), 112 SASE refusals.

    Re-pinned 2026-08-03 for the gray-zone lane: Shin-Hong
    (``bl_pbl_physics=11``) became routable and this census was never
    re-run, so the pins were stale rather than wrong -- 1386 is IDENTICAL
    at ``cf159eb2`` (the shipped 1.5.1), ``cfcfa9a9`` (the pre-merge lane
    tip that added the route) and ``61488333`` (the merge).  Scheme 11
    adds ONE pbl value to the sweep and every count below is that value's
    own slice, measured and not projected:

        rows        1386 -> 1722   (+336)
        rejected    1302 -> 1638   (+336)
        lsm4 rows    336 ->  420   ( +84)
        lsm4 WRF-scheme refusals
                     168 ->  252   ( +84)

    224 is exactly sfclay {1, 91} x lsm {0, 2, 3, 4} x km_opt {1, 4} x
    7 microphysics x cu {0, 1}, and the 224 refusals are the same product
    over the sfclay values WRF v4.6.1's table refuses with this scheme,
    {0, 5}.  Shin-Hong takes YSU's surface-layer pairing exactly, so its
    slice is the SAME SIZE as YSU's at every cut: the measured census
    reads 224 rows and 224 refusals for pbl=1 as well, and 56 of each in
    the lsm4 slice.  The whole sweep is now the 7 x 4 x 5 x 4 x 2 x 2 =
    2240 product, and 1148 + 1092 = 2240 accounts for all of it.

    MYJ RE-PIN, 2026-08-09 (lane/port-myj).  This port routes TWO new
    selectors -- sf_sfclay_physics=2 (Eta similarity) and bl_pbl_physics=2
    (MYJ) -- so it widens BOTH swept axes at once, the first change here to
    do that.  The cross-product goes 5 sfclay x 6 pbl x 4 lsm x 2 km_opt x
    7 mp x 2 cu = 3360, and 1260 + 2100 = 3360 accounts for all of it.
    Every number below was measured by
    `python tools/health_field_census.py --json configs/real74_4dom.toml`
    on this tree, and each delta is accounted for exactly:

        rows        1148 -> 1260  (+112)
        rejected    1092 -> 2100  (+1008)
        lsm4 rows    280 ->  308   (+28)
        lsm4 WRF-scheme refusals
                     168 ->  392  (+224)
        SASE refusals
                     448 ->  560  (+112), of which 112 are the MYJ
                                  pairing law rather than km_opt

    +112 rows is exactly MYJ's own slice: sfclay {2} x lsm {0,2,3,4} x
    km_opt {1,4} x 7 mp x cu {0,1}.  MYJ is the FIRST scheme here whose
    slice is smaller than YSU's, and the reason is the pairing: WRF admits
    YSU with two surface layers and MYJ with exactly one
    (module_physics_init.F:3770-3772), so MYJ measures 112 rows where YSU
    measures 224.  The +1008 refusals are 448 (MYJ with a surface layer it
    refuses) plus 560 (the Eta layer with a PBL it refuses) -- the pairing
    law, counted from both sides.  SASE's extra 112 are the 
    sfclay=2 x pbl=900 cells, which now hit validate_myj_pairing before
    they ever reach the km_opt check, so the "every SASE refusal names
    km_opt" assertion below is scoped to the cells where that is still
    true instead of being deleted.

    What did NOT move, again, is the point: the worst selectable
    descriptor count is unchanged at 632 of 1024.  MYJ adds nine 2-D
    surface fields and two 3-D columns under its own selectors, and the
    widest configuration is still someone else's.

    THE KM_OPT AXIS IS TWO VALUES, NOT THREE, ON THIS LINE.  The census
    probes validate_run_config for the selectable set rather than
    transcribing one, and the 1.7 validator refuses km_opt=3 unless
    bl_pbl_physics=0.  The reference config this sweep is built from runs
    a PBL, so km_opt=3 is genuinely not selectable here and the probe
    reports it accurately.  Every count below is therefore the 1.5.2 line's
    two-thirds where km_opt multiplies -- and the two numbers that do NOT
    multiply by it, the 632 peak and the 608 widest pbl11 row, are
    unchanged, which is the claim this file exists to hold.

    SASE is untouched in kind and scales in count with the axis: 448
    rejections, 112 of them in the lsm4 slice, zero measured rows.  The one thing worth checking beyond arithmetic is the
    ceiling, and scheme 11 does not approach it -- the widest pbl=11 row
    measures 608 descriptors against the unchanged 632 peak, so the peak,
    the peak set and the 392 of 1024 headroom all stay exactly where they
    were.

    What did NOT move is the point: the worst selectable descriptor count
    is unchanged at 632 of 1024.  A mixing option joining or leaving the
    selectable set ties the existing peak instead of moving it, which is
    what "km_opt does not change the inventory" has always claimed and is
    now measured across two values again.

    Re-pinned 2026-08-09 for the Milbrandt-Yau lane: mp_physics=9 became
    routable, so the microphysics axis is 8 values instead of 7 and the
    whole sweep is now 8 x 4 x 5 x 4 x 2 x 2 = 2560, with 1312 + 1248
    accounting for all of it.  Scheme 9 adds exactly ONE microphysics
    value and every count below is that value's own slice, measured:

        rows        1148 -> 1312   (+164)
        rejected    1092 -> 1248   (+156)
        sase rej     448 ->  512    (+64)
        lsm4 rows    280 ->  320    (+40)
        lsm4 WRF-scheme refusals
                     168 ->  192    (+24)
        lsm4 SASE refusals
                     112 ->  128    (+16)

    Its slice is the SAME SIZE as every other scheme's at every cut,
    which is the point: 164 rows like mp 0/1/6/8/10/18/28, not a
    partial one.  It was partial for one measurement -- 82 rows -- while
    woof/core/kf.py refused Kain-Fritsch with mp=9, and that refusal was
    a real gap rather than a WRF fact (Registry.EM_COMMON:3025 declares
    qi and qs, so F_QI/F_QS are both true and KF_eta_CPS has its branch).
    Fixing the contract rather than pinning the halved number is why the
    slice is whole here.  The ceiling is untouched: the widest mp=9 row
    measures 420 descriptors against the unchanged 632 peak.

    1.9 INTEGRATION RE-PIN.  The two blocks above are each a lane's own
    measurement against 1.8.7, and neither is the number once both land:
    MYJ widens the PBL and surface-layer axes while Milbrandt-Yau widens
    the microphysics axis, so the movements MULTIPLY and adding the two
    deltas would under-count by 428 rows.  That intermediate sweep was
    5 sfclay x 6 pbl x 4 lsm x 2 km_opt x 8 mp x 2 cu = 3840, with
    1440 + 2400 accounting for all of it.

    P3 then adds the NINTH microphysics value, and WDM6 the TENTH.
    Neither touches a PBL, surface-layer, land-surface, cumulus or
    km_opt axis, so both movements are one more value on one axis.  The
    sweep is
    5 sfclay x 6 pbl x 4 lsm x 2 km_opt x 10 mp x 2 cu = 4800, and
    1800 + 3000 = 4800 accounts for all of it.  Every number below was
    re-measured by
    `python tools/health_field_census.py --json configs/real74_4dom.toml`
    on the merged tree, and each one is the per-microphysics-value rate
    carried across two more values:

        rows        1260 -> 1440 -> 1620 -> 1800  (180 per mp value)
        rejected    2100 -> 2400 -> 2700 -> 3000  (300 per mp value)
        lsm4 rows    308 ->  352 ->  396 ->  440  ( 44 per mp value)
        lsm4 WRF-scheme refusals
                     392 ->  448 ->  504 ->  560  ( 56 per mp value)
        SASE refusals
                     560 ->  640 ->  720 ->  800  ( 80 per mp value), of
                                   which 160 are the MYJ pairing law
                                   rather than km_opt

    The per-value rates are asserted, not assumed: the measured census
    reports exactly 180 rows and 300 refusals for EVERY one of the ten
    microphysics values, mp=50 and mp=16 included, so each new scheme's
    slice is a full one.

    The ceiling is untouched by any of the four lanes: the peak is
    still 632 of 1024 at mp18-lsm3-pbl5-sfclay5-cu1-km1.  Neither MYJ's
    surface fields, nor Milbrandt-Yau's twelve transported moments, nor
    P3's rime pair and previous-step carriers, nor WDM6's three
    transported numbers produce the widest configuration.

    9d8055e26, lane/europe-uw-pbl, adds WRF v4.7.1's UW PBL selector 9
    to the routed PBL axis. It must join this census because the census
    measures every routed state inventory, including newer WRF component
    ports. The axis grows from six to seven values, not by a Thompson or
    MYNN generation choice. UW adds 480 measured rows and 320 refusals;
