"""``NT_CALL_ORDER`` is checked against the source, not only against itself.

WHY THIS EXISTS (review). ``check_order`` compares OBSERVED launches
against the DECLARED sequence, which catches a launcher that runs the
stages wrongly. It cannot catch a *declaration* that is wrong, because the
declaration is the reference. That is the same structure as every
hand-maintained list this port has been bitten by, and three members were
missing from work counts before anyone noticed: the assembler,
``cu_ntiedtke_post_run``, and ``cu_ntiedtke_run``'s post-conversion. All
three surfaced by walking the sequence, none by reading the list.

TWO INDEPENDENT CROSS-CHECKS, from artifacts that already exist:

1. **Source order.** ``cumastrn`` and ``cu_ntiedtke_run`` are straight-line
   code, so source order IS call order. The ownership manifest maps every
   live line to the stage that performs it, so a stage owning lines
   strictly before another's must precede it.

2. **Dataflow.** No stage may read an array before some stage has written
   it, unless that array is a declared input or seed. A missing stage shows
   up here as its consumer's inputs having no producer -- which is exactly
   how the post-conversion was found, by hand, before this test existed.

The two fail independently: (1) catches a reordering, (2) catches an
omission.
