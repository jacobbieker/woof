"""The install guide says what each pip artifact actually carries.

pyproject's package data puts the staged native tools
(``woof/libexec/bridges``) into the wheel, and setup.py tags a wheel that
carries them for its one platform.  The guide's pip paragraph still said
a pip wheel contains no compiled Rust, beside a paragraph of the same
page saying the platform wheels carry them.
