"""The queue's card lines belong to processes, not to numbers: handed over, kept and removed by identity.

The defects this file holds shut:

- A started forecast's OWNER line was handed to its wrapper's PID with no
  check that the PID was still the wrapper, and a run that had already
  ended was released by a bare PID check.
- The queue removed an ended run's line by PID alone, so another claim that
  happened to carry the same number (another tag, another time) went with
  it and two programs could start on one card.
- A start that failed left the queue's line in the OWNER file.
- A page server that stopped between claiming the card and handing its line
  to the run's wrapper left the line for good, since no record named it:
  harmless while no process held its number, and holding the card for
  whichever process was given that number next.  A line of the server's
  tag whose process had ended stayed the same way.
- A claim recorded before its line was written carried no time, so the
  sweep after that server stopped removed every line of its tag under its
  number: the live line of a run another page server had started, once
  that run was given the same number.
- A start the engine had accepted whose commands.log line or job record
  could not be written was put back in the queue and started a second time
  once the card was free, its card line was let go while it ran, and Start
  said the start had failed.
