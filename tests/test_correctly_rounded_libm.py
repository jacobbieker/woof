"""``exp_cr``/``log_cr`` give the correctly rounded double on every host.

The point of the module under test is that its answers do not depend on whose
C library the interpreter is linked against, so the assertions here are
absolute values -- the correctly rounded binary64 result, spelled in hex so a
one-ulp move is visible in the text of the diff -- and not a comparison
against :mod:`math`.  Comparing against :mod:`math` is what the module exists
to stop doing.

Provenance of the expected values: computed at 300 bits with ``mpmath`` and
pasted here.  ``mpmath`` is not a declared dependency of this project, so the
cross-check against it is a separate test that skips when it is absent; the
pinned table is what runs everywhere.
