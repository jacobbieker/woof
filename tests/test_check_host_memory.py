"""``woof check`` prices the forcing decode's HOST RAM, and says INCOMPLETE.

THE DEFECT, reproduced on the published 2.6.0 wheel and on 2.6.5.  A user
ran a three-domain ERA5 forecast, `woof run` printed the single word
``Terminated`` and nothing else, and the `woof check` they ran afterwards
had said this:

    woof input preflight: PASS
      BINDING PHASE: the forecast is the memory-binding phase at 23.06 GiB
                     peak envelope; it fits the 31.50 GiB budget with
                     8.44 GiB to spare
      alloc_fits_vram_budget:        not measured
      alloc_measured_le_estimate:    not measured
      alloc_estimate_le_vram_budget: PASS
    $ echo $?
    0

Two things are wrong with that page and both are here.

FIRST, EVERY FIGURE ON IT IS DEVICE MEMORY.  ``IngestMemoryEstimate``
opens by saying so -- "Itemized device memory for the preprocessing phase
of one TREE" -- and the phase it prices decodes the forcing to float64 on
the SOURCE grid, 204 two-dimensional fields per valid time for ERA5, and
holds two copies of every one of them at once while the case is prepared
(the decoder's arrays under ``_decode_era5_forcing_partials_resolved``
and the frozen snapshot's copies under ``_decode_era5_gribs_resolved``,
both ``@lru_cache``).  On a global 0.25 degree field over eight valid times
that is 25.25 GiB of RAM that no door in this product had ever weighed.
A host allocation that does not fit is refused by the kernel or reaped by
a watchdog, which kills the process from OUTSIDE: no traceback, nothing
for woof to print, one word from the shell.

SECOND, ONE OF THREE GATES IS NOT A VERDICT.  ``evaluate_alloc_gates`` is
scrupulous -- ``None`` for every leg it could not evaluate, and its own
docstring says "a missing measurement can never report a pass".  The
report then dropped the ``None`` legs and took ``all()`` over what was
left, and ``all([True])`` is ``all([True, True, True])``.  The memory
section printed no verdict word of its own at all, so the only one on the
page came from ``woof/ingest/preflight.py`` about nineteen CPU file, time
and table checks, none of which is about memory.

THE CONTROL IS THE OTHER HALF of both: a chain whose legs were all
measured still reads PASS, and a decode that fits still exits 0.

The data is stubbed and the logic is not: these tests drive the real
``woof check`` front door, the real handoff between its two halves and
the real arithmetic, with a stand-in for the decoded catalog that only a
multi-gigabyte GRIB could otherwise supply.
