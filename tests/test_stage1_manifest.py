"""The release battery's stage-1 curated list, kept accurate in the repository.

``tools/battery/stage1_files.txt`` is the list the battery's stage-1 leg
runs.  Until task #122 it existed only as a ``$stage1`` array inside the
per-assembly scratchpad queue scripts, propagated by copy from one
assembly to the next: a lost scratchpad silently lost every amendment
ever made to it, and nothing anywhere failed when it did.

This suite is the gate on the file that replaced that.  It checks the
mechanical properties the queue scripts depend on -- every path resolves,
nothing is listed twice, every entry is a repository-relative test file --
and it pins the two entries whose absence caused a real miss, so a
"tidy-up" that drops one of them has to argue with a named incident
rather than with a bare list.
