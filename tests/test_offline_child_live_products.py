"""A downscaled child draws every frame as it lands, and a stop stops it.

The breakage these pin: the draw-as-it-lands render was armed on the
run-plan route only.  A downscaled child forwarded its committed frames
to the first-frame render alone, so the analysis frame was drawn early
and every other frame waited for the forecast to end: in a 250 m child
f001 landed at 10:40 and was drawn at 13:16, and both children measured
emitted 0 ``live_products_ready`` events while their parent emitted 12.

A stand-in renderer writes what the real one writes (a picture in the
render layout and a ``render-georef.json``), so the queue, the finalize
skip and the stop are pinned without spending a real render; the real
render is proved on a real child separately.
