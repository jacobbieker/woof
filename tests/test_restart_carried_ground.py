"""A nest carried by a moving parent keeps its ring rain across a restart.

When a following parent moves, a nest that rides inside it at the same
parent-relative placement is rebuilt on new ground: its accumulators shift
in index space and interior rain lands in its specified-zone ring.  The
checkpoint lists only the grids that moved themselves in
``moved_grid_ids``, so the restore read the carried nest as "never moved"
and the ring migration zeroed that rain (a 9/3/1 km vortex-following run
resumed at hour three with 71 east-edge d03 RAINNC cells at zero where the
unbroken run held 6.6 to 70.4 mm).
