    repo path cannot be silently downgraded to "must be somebody else's

    substring the CLAIM is about -- that still appears in the cited lines.
    Existence is not enough; a drifted citation resolves to a line that
    exists and says something else.

    WHY THIS TEST EXISTS.  The checker was written, never wired to anything,
    and rotted: run for the first time on 2026-08-01 it reported 90 failures,
    ~30 of them ``RESOLVED`` rows for citations the registry had not carried

    ``dyn_em/module_initialize_real.F`` and ``phys/module_physics_init.F``,
    so every one of the ten mp=28 citations failed. A checker nobody runs
    catches nothing, and its own tables become a second thing to be wrong.

    IT FOUND REAL DEFECTS, AND THEY WERE PUBLISHED RATHER THAN SUPPRESSED.
    Two YSU warnings cited ``kernels/ysu.cu`` lines that did not say what
    the warning says, and sat in the checker's ``DRIFTED`` table as OPEN
    rows, each carrying the anchor its claim is about so ``check`` would
    fail the moment the cited range contained it.  Both are fixed in the

    is anchored in ``RESOLVED``, and the bare ``:1315`` the scanner had
    attributed to the kernel is spelled ``bl_ysu.F90:1315``, the WRF line
    it always meant.  ``DRIFTED`` is empty, and the set is pinned below so

    # 2.  It required a claim that had become FALSE.  "No forecast has ever

    # What is still true, and is what this now requires, is the NARROWER
    # claim: no REAL-DATA and no NESTED forecast has been compared, and

    Every other gate on this row compares one written-down number against
    another written-down number: registry against docs, registry against the
    gate's declared bound, registry against the fixture deck on disk.  All of
    those stay green while the whole set drifts away from what the port
    actually computes, because a transcription is only as current as the last
    person who retyped it -- and this row's entire accuracy rests on the
    numbers being the real ones.  So this runs the nineteen fixtures through
    the shipped adapter on the device and rebuilds the published partition
    from the result.

    Three things are asserted, and the first two are the ones a stale
    transcription breaks:

    * a fixture the registry calls CLEAN must clear the gate on every field
      today -- otherwise the option is publishing a clean claim it no longer
      earns, which is the exact overclaim ``implemented-unverified`` exists to
      prevent;
    * a fixture the registry lists as a residual must still miss, on exactly
      the fields published, at exactly the published values;
    * the values are compared at the precision they are published to
      (``%.3e``), because that is the precision at which they are quoted in
      ``docs/public/PHYSICS.md``, ``PROVENANCE.md`` and the registry alike.

    Exact comparison is legitimate rather than flaky: the measurement was
    repeated three times end to end on this device and all 19x16 values were
    BIT-identical across repeats, so there is no run-to-run jitter for a
    tolerance to absorb.  If that ever stops being true the right response is
    to record the spread, not to widen this.
