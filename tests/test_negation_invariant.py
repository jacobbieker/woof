"""The resolved-scale disclaimer stays negated, and the guard can see it fail.

``tools/check_negation_invariant.py`` is only worth shipping if it changes
its verdict when the negation is removed.  So the essential tests here
are the three mutants: each deletes one negation from a scratch copy of
``README.md`` -- the mutants are built in ``tmp_path`` and never written
back to the tree -- and the checker must return FAIL where the unmutated
copy returns PASS.  A checker whose verdict does not move for any one of
them is non-discriminating for that failure mode and is not adopted.

M1 is the reason the guard enforces two scopes.  Its sentence still holds
an earlier negation ("not as a resolved-tornado claim"), so a purely
sentence-scoped checker keeps passing after the deletion; only the
line-scoped half sees it.
