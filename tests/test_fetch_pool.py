"""The bounded-concurrency transfer pool behind every multi-file fetch.

Pure CPU: jobs are callables, no network.  What is pinned here is the
contract the fetch routes rely on:

* admission is in submission order, on the caller's thread, so manifest
  publication keeps its exact serial semantics;
* concurrency is bounded by the worker count AND by the per-host
  politeness caps (NOMADS is capped harder than everyone else);
* one failed file fails the whole request closed, re-raising the
  original refusal so its message still names the file;
* the receipt records files, bytes, workers, wall and the effective
  speedup against the serial model (the sum of per-file seconds).
