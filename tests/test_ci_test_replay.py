"""``tools/ci_test_replay.py`` builds a venv the job it replays would have.

THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES, scratch-proven at the 2.5.0 cut and never
committed.  The publish workflow's ``test`` job runs on ``setup-python``
3.11, whose environment carries setuptools -- ensurepip bundled it through
3.11.  ``python -m venv`` on 3.12+ carries pip and nothing else (PEP 632
took setuptools out), and two of the job's own test files measure what the
wheel would contain by driving setuptools directly.  Those files REFUSE by
design when setuptools is absent, because a silent skip of a packaging gate
reports green.

So on any 3.12+ interpreter the replay failed on its own venv while the job
it claims to replay was fine: the verdict described the harness, not the
tree.  A harness that can only be trusted on one interpreter minor is a
harness nobody can point at a public snapshot.
