"""F1: what ``[render]`` may promise, on the interpreters wheels exist for.

MEASURED against the index, 2026-08-17 -- ``pypi.org/pypi/wrf-rust/0.2.39``
publishes 26 artifacts::

    wrf_rust-0.2.39-cp310-cp310-{macosx_10_12_x86_64,macosx_11_0_arm64,
        manylinux_2_17_aarch64,manylinux_2_17_x86_64,win_amd64}.whl
    ... cp311 ... cp312 ... cp313 ... cp314 (the same five each)
    wrf_rust-0.2.39.tar.gz

cp314 wheels on ALL FIVE platforms, so the gap this file used to pin --
0.2.38 publishing no cp314 wheel, pip falling back to an sdist whose pyo3
caps at 3.13, and the whole ``pip install 'recast-woof[gpu-cu13,render]'``
resolution dying with it -- is closed at the source.  What replaces the
environment marker is the FLOOR: the extra resolves 0.2.39 or newer, which
is the oldest release with a wheel for every interpreter woof supports.

Two things are pinned here, and the second is the reason the file survives
its own fix:

* the 0.2.39 reality -- no marker, an install floor that names why it is
  where it is, and no shipped sentence claiming a 3.14 gap that no longer
  exists;
* the MECHANISM that named the gap.  A ceiling is a fact about the index,
  and the index moves: 0.2.39 publishes nothing for 3.15.  So doctor still
  reports a marker-excluded science core as ``excluded`` with a named
  reason rather than ``missing`` with a pip line that installs nothing --
  exercised here against a hypothetical future ceiling, because the whole
  cost of the 2026-08-17 outage was that this path did not exist.
