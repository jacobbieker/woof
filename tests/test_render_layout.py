"""The rendered-output directory layout -- domain / product / valid day.

The defect: every PNG a run drew landed in ONE directory.  A three-nest
run of the rust catalog at hourly output puts five figures of files
there, of every product and every valid time, and the only way to find
one is to read filenames.  The field report that opened this was
"thousands of frames of all sorts of timestamps and plot types in one
directory".

The layout that replaces it is the 2026-08-06 project ruling (case folder ->
domain -> product subfolders) with the reporter's timestamp request
slotted into it as the leaf grouping:

    <--out>/<domain-token>/<product>/<valid-day>/<filename>.png

It is the DEFAULT, not a flag.  ``--layout flat`` is retained only so a
consumer written against the old flat directory has somewhere to stand
while it is updated; nothing in the product selects it.

These tests pin three things a script can rely on: the path is a pure
function of (domain, product, valid time) so it can be predicted without
globbing; the flat spelling is byte-for-byte the v2.4.1 spelling; and
every in-tree reader of these directories (``--pair``, the early-render
publisher) finds files in both layouts.
