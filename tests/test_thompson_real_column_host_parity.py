"""mp_physics=28 on real model columns: the port's own kernels, compiled for
the host, against WRF v4.6.1's own Fortran, process rate by process rate.

The breakage each gate prevents, named:

1. ``test_rate_readback_anchors_match_the_kernels`` -- the harness reads
   every process rate out of the production kernels by inserting readback
   calls at one anchor line per kernel, next to local variables it names
   (tools/thompson_real_column_parity/port_rates.py): the three aerosol
   units for mp=28 and the classic kernels of thompson.cu for mp=8.  A
   kernel edit that moves an anchor or renames a rate variable breaks the
   harness, and with it the only process-by-process check of either port
   against WRF on real columns.  Pure text; runs everywhere.

2. ``test_the_fixture_covers_every_repaired_regime`` -- the committed
   fixture was cut per regime from WRF's own checkpoint streams
   (tools/thompson_real_column_parity/make_fixture.py).  A re-cut that
   loses a regime would leave the repair that lives there unguarded while
   gate 3 stays green.  Pure data; runs everywhere.

3. ``test_real_columns_against_wrf461`` -- the fixture
   ``tests/data/thompson_real_columns_wrf461.npz`` holds 42 saved real-data
   model columns and the answers unmodified WRF v4.6.1 gave for them
   (gfortran 13.3, glibc 2.39).  The port's production adapter runs on the
   same float32 inputs through the host backend, and every process rate,
   the final state, reflectivity and surface precipitation are compared.

   What it pins: the cells where a quantity differs from WRF by more than
   1e-2 relative and neither rounding rule explains the gap (the port's own
   response to a one-unit nudge of every input, or four float32 units of
   the largest value the cell held; plus the two named rules for the rates
   rounding itself decides, see fixture_check.py).  Every process rate and
   every final-state quantity must have none.  (Until the no-micro column
   exit and the terminal vapour floor were repaired the final vapour was
   pinned at four such cells: G, WRF floors vapour at 1.E-10 at every level
   of a column with microphysics (:3974) and the port left a level at
   exactly zero at zero.)  Undoing any of the twelve repairs
   of 2026-09-23 fails this gate: measured for the entry rewrite (the echo
   then differs by 9.4 dB, and ice nucleation in four cells) and the cloud
   fallout gate (cloud water and droplet number in two cells), and the
   port as it stood before the repairs fails it on 20 rates and 10
   final-state quantities, its echo 9.4 dB from WRF.  Reflectivity is
   held to 0.01 dB.

   Where it runs: a POSIX box with a C++ compiler and the staged Thompson
   table set, or the Windows desktop through WSL with the same.  It skips,
   naming the missing piece, where either is absent -- the hosted CI runners
   carry no ``freezeH2O.dat`` (254 MB, not packaged).

4. ``test_real_columns_against_wrf461_mp8`` -- the same 42 columns with the
   answers WRF's same module gives them as classic Thompson
   (``tests/data/thompson_real_columns_wrf461_mp8.npz``, written by
   ``make_fixture.py --mp8``), graded through ``woof.core.microphysics.
   _apply_thompson``.  mp=8 runs the shared ``thompson.cu`` kernels, and
   before this gate nothing compared its process rates with WRF's.  It pins,
   per rate and per final-state quantity, the cells beyond 1e-2 that no
   rounding rule explains, EXACTLY: a count that grows is a new difference
   from WRF, and a count that shrinks is a repair that must retire its pin
   here.  Every count it recorded when it was committed (f382c8825) was
   retired by the repair that closed it, so the pins are empty and the
   echo is held to 0.05 dB (see ``PINNED_RATE_CELLS_MP8``).
