"""The Python side's word-match on the reader's refusals is held to them.

``woof/ingest/wrf_soil_recovery.py`` decides WHICH REMEDY a user is
given by matching words inside the refusal the Rust reader returned:
``_LAYER_REFUSAL_MARKS`` means the declaration is wrong, and
``_CONVERSION_REFUSAL_MARK`` means both files are right and the
arithmetic between them is not.  Everything else means the wrong pair of
files was found.

That match is a hand transcription of another crate's sentences and
nothing pinned the pair.  Either side could be reworded alone: reword
the Rust and a user with a wrong declaration is told to go and find
files they already have, which is what a field report recorded;
reword the Python marks and the same thing happens silently.

The pairing is read out of the Rust SOURCE rather than out of a built
binary, deliberately.  The strings are compile-time literals, so the
source is the same evidence the binary would give, and a test that
needed ``cargo`` would skip on every machine that has no toolchain --
which is every machine this most needs to run on.  What the source
cannot show is whether the crate builds, and that is not this file's
question.

WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS

* every refusal in the reader is accounted for, so a new one cannot
  appear unclassified;
* exactly the three refusals about the declared layer set carry a layer
  mark;
* exactly the one refusal about the conversion carries the conversion
  mark, and no refusal carries both, because the remedies are chosen in
  order and two marks on one sentence would make that order the thing
  deciding a user's answer.
