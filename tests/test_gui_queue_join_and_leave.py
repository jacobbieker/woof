"""A forecast joins the queue, leaves it, or is refused, and the answer says what happened.

The defects this file holds shut:

- Remove answered "Removed from the queue" while a folder it could not
  delete kept its queued marker, so the scheduler's walk of the forecasts
  folder (or a restart of the page server) put the forecast back in line
  and it started.  A marker Remove could not delete was reported as a
  success the same way.
- A queued forecast the scheduler started before the reply was written was
  answered with HTTP 500 ("'t1' is not in list"): the reply read its place
  back from the line after the start had taken it out.
- A disk that filled while a new forecast's files were written, before
  its start or its place in line, answered with the page server's generic
  HTTP 500 and left the folder behind, so the same name was refused as a
  run that already exists once there was room again.  The event page's
  button did the same.  A line that could not be saved after the marker
  was written left the marker for the scheduler's walk to start.
