"""``woof domain --source`` is the source registry, not a hand-held list.

The 2026-08-17 model battery ran ten init sources end to end and found the
wizard door open for three of them: ``woof domain --source`` accepted
``{gfs, hrrr, era5}``, so every other battery TOML was hand-assembled from a
``--root-dx 3`` emission with the boundary cadence typed in by a person.  A
source with a runnable profile and no way to plan a domain for it is
engine-proven, not shipped.

These tests bind the closure, and they are deliberately written so that not
one of them names a model in an assertion about mechanism:

* every registered runnable source plans, and its emitted ``namelist.wps``
  carries the cadence its REGISTRY ROW declares;
* a regional source refuses an out-of-coverage plan AT PLAN TIME, naming the
  corner, the source index it maps to and the window -- the ICON-EU failure
  the battery could only get out of a preparation traceback;
* a row nobody has written code for still plans (the arbitrary acceptance
  test: a synthetic registry row goes through the whole door);
* a registered row with no runnable route refuses by name rather than by
  argparse's "invalid choice".
