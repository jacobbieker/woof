"""THE ARMING TEST: three bound roads, one carrier inventory, on the card.

Bundle-07 review, finding 1 (CRITICAL, #219-not-structurally-closed).  The
ship refusal the review placed on the store-direct prepared-cache route
stands "until arm-3 of the clock test is green on the release line", and
this file is that test.

WHAT THE OTHER GATES DO NOT COVER.  ``tests/test_streaming_clock_bind.py``
proves the state-backed streamed road consumes the bound ``dtbc``
recurrence, but it reaches that road through
``streaming.standalone_domain_builder`` -- which always has a resident
``DomainState`` to derive the binding from.  ``store_domain_builder`` has
none: it calls ``attach(None, ...)``, and the lazy ``domain_clock()`` behind
``make_tile_hook`` returned ``None`` there, latched ``converted[...]``
permanently, and ran every buffer of the forecast on the retired
``elapsed - interval.start`` recurrence.  That is the road the LARGEST
domains take, and the one least likely to have a resident control beside it.
``tests/test_streaming.py`` pins the POLICY (the refusal, the source shape,
the state-less hook binding without a card); nothing anywhere ran the three
roads against each other with real forcing on real tiles.

THE SHAPE, exactly as the review specified it:

* a small specified-boundary case with NONZERO boundary tendencies,
* ``warmup=0`` (production primes carriers directly),
* ``nbuffers=2`` with MORE TILES THAN BUFFERS, so buffers really do change
  tiles and every conversion is re-checked rather than latched once,
* six steps, which crosses one boundary-interval seam,
* THREE BOUND ARMS -- resident, state-backed streamed, store-direct --
  whose carrier inventories must be BYTE-IDENTICAL,
* every converted tile's attachment clock asserted to BE the node's clock
  object, per launch, not merely non-None,
* plus a FOURTH, legacy-elapsed arm that must DIFFER, which is what proves
  the forcing in this fixture is strong enough to expose a dropped binding.
  Without it the three greens above could all be the same zero.
