"""The FTZ claim census covers the tree, and it can be made to fail.

The mutations below drive the ways a census goes stale: a claim sentence
nobody registered, a registered one removed, reworded, copied or moved to
another file, a token that contradicts the receipt, a hash edited by hand,
and a stated total that disagrees with the records.  A census gate that
survives any of them is decoration.

Lines added or removed above a claim must NOT fail it.  A row added to
CHANGELOG.md moves every claim below it and changes none of them; while the
line number was part of a site's key that failed the gate, so every branch
that added a row rewrote the census and two such branches conflicted in it.
