"""A memory refusal names only ways out that are not refused again.

When the smallest layout of a ladder does not fit the card, the wizard
names the levers that would move the refusal: a lighter physics suite, a
shallower ladder, a larger card.  Each named lever has to be one the same
door then accepts.  A suite that is cheaper than the refused one but
still over the same budget is not a way out: following it reproduces the
refusal that named it.
