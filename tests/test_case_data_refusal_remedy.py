"""The ``[case_data]`` refusals must carry a remedy, and ``--explain``
must add substance rather than repeat the refusal.

Measured on this tree through the shipped CLI before the fix.  Both
refusals printed the SAME text with and without ``--explain``, and
neither named a way out:

  no table::

    woof static: experiment config <path> carries no [case_data] table;
    the experiment runtime requires declared inputs (forcing, vtable,
    wps_namelist, geog_root, and policies).

  keys missing from a table that IS there::

    woof static: [case_data] of <path> is missing required key(s)
    ['wps_namelist', 'geog_root', 'sfcp_to_sfcp']: every input path and
    policy is declared, never implicit.

A reader who has just been told which keys are required still does not
know what to write in them, which command writes them, or -- the case
that matters most, because it is the one a wizard emission actually
lands in -- that their config is not missing a table at all and belongs
on the other route.  Both messages were unlayered ``ValueError``s, so
the flag this product puts on every subcommand added exactly nothing.

Every test here fails against the tree as it stood at ``e8c05bdc0``.
