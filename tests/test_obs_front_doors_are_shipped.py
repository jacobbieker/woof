"""A front door a refusal names must be one the pipeline actually ships.

The ``rw_mpas_convert`` precedent, one wave later: ``rw_mrms``,
``rw_stage4``, ``rw_asos`` and ``rw_goes`` were written, tested,
committed, and resolved out of ``~/.woof/bridges`` by
:mod:`woof.obs.frontdoor` -- and none of them was in
:data:`woof.bridge_assets.BUNDLED_ARTIFACTS`, so ``woof
fetch-bridges``, the command their own refusals led with, staged a
complete bundle and the refusal repeated verbatim.  Committed is not
shipped.

Every test here is a property of the SHIPPING path, not of the source
tree: what the bundle table declares, what the release workflow builds,
what the stamp contract can prove, and whether a refusal names a remedy
that can supply the thing it is refusing about.
