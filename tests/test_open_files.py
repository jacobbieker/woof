"""The open-file budget a preparation asks for before it starts.

The defect these cover, measured on the shipped 1.4.1 build (RTX 4080,
Ubuntu 24.04, soft RLIMIT_NOFILE 1024, hard 1048576): a 120 h GFS
series is 41 forcing times x 24 decoded arrays = 984 descriptors held
at once, the process peaked at 1023, and preprocessing died with

    rw-wps --source gfs: [Errno 24] Too many open files: '.../decoded/f000'

The identical command with the soft limit raised to the hard limit
completed at rc 0.  So the route the README calls Supported had a hard
ceiling on forecast length, and it announced itself as an IO fault
against a path that had already been read successfully.
