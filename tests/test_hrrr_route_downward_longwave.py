"""The HRRR route's downward longwave is COMPUTED, not a seeded constant.

Provenance, and why this file exists at all.

v1.7.1's headline fix was a surface-dewpoint collapse: a shipped real
case ran ``ra_sw_physics = 1`` (Dudhia shortwave) with
``ra_lw_physics = 0`` (longwave OFF).  ``woof/core/dudhia.py`` returns
``glw=fields["glw"]`` -- the seeded field, echoed back untouched -- so
the downward longwave for the whole run was whatever
:func:`woof.core.physics.initialize_physics` had seeded, which for the
HRRR route is its ``glw=300.0`` default.  Shortwave heated the surface
by day; at night the surface radiated into a frozen 300 W/m2 and skin
temperature cratered.  The replay evidence had one unmistakable
signature: **exactly one distinct GLW value across the entire run**.

1.7.1 fixed the gfs/era5 doors and added the load guard.  It could not
fix HRRR, because every full-radiation profile the HRRR route admits is
an mp8 suite and the root preparer staged no microphysics tables for
those -- so the route's default stayed asymmetric and 1.7.1 shipped an
auto-declaration in its place.  1.8 staged the tables and flipped the
default (``woof.hrrr_route_inputs.ROUTE_DEFAULT_PHYSICS_PROFILE``).

So this file asserts the FIXED signature -- many distinct GLW values,
varying in space and in time, produced by a radiation solver -- and it
asserts the BROKEN one still reproduces on the suite that had it,
because a detector that cannot fire is not evidence.  Both arms run on
a real card through the real driver; nothing here is a mock.

#: ``glw`` default through 1.8.7, and therefore the HRRR route's entire
#: downward longwave for the life of a longwave-off run.  A PAST value,
#: kept because it is what the v1.7.1 replay evidence reported and what
#: the detector below is calibrated against.  There is no live default
#: at all now -- ``glw`` has none, and an undeclared longwave-off run is
#: REFUSED rather than seeded, which
#: :func:`test_an_undeclared_downward_longwave_is_refused_not_seeded`
#: measures on the card.
#: The harness seeds a different value on purpose, so that "frozen" is
#: proven as *equal to whatever was seeded* rather than as equal to any
#: one constant; a test that only ever saw 300.0 could not tell a
#: passthrough from a coincidence.
RETIRED_SEEDED_GLW = 300.0

#: A pre-dawn window over the reporting user's latitude band.  Local

#: THE discriminator, and it is not variance.
#:
#: Downward longwave over a fixed thermodynamic column is genuinely
#: near-constant -- it is set by the atmosphere's temperature and
#: humidity profile, not by the sun -- so "GLW changed a lot" is a weak
#: reading of a real solver and a first attempt at this test nearly
#: mistook a correct one for a broken one.  What separates computed from
#: seeded without ambiguity is INDEPENDENCE: run the identical column
#: twice with two different seeds.  A passthrough returns each seed
#: verbatim, so its two answers differ by exactly the seed difference.
#: A solver ignores them both and returns the same physics twice.

    This is the 1.7.1 configuration as a production route actually

    came out at 300.0 W/m2 -- a plausible clear-sky value, one distinct
    number for the whole run, in every wrfout and in Noah's energy
    budget, which is why the dewpoint collapse read as weather.

    There is no seed now, of any value.  ``glw`` has NO DEFAULT, and
    this pairing -- no longwave scheme, Noah reading GLW every surface
    step -- is exactly the class ``_resolve_initial_glw`` refuses rather

    accurate zero: a zero sky is still not a sky, and a run that wants a
    fixed one now has to say so at the call site.  The refusal names the
    selector, what reads GLW, and the three ways out.

    the absence of one.  The declared arm below is what still proves the
