"""The assembled Noah-MP column slab against the scalar authority, bitwise.

:mod:`woof.core.noahmp_column_slab` owns no arithmetic -- every value it
returns is produced by a slab module that carries its own bitwise gate.  What
it owns is the *hand-offs*, and a wrong hand-off (BARE_FLUX reading the entry
QSFC instead of VEGE_FLUX's, PHASECHANGE reading the entry STC instead of
TSNOSOI's, WATER reading ENERGY's DZSNSO instead of the prefix's) produces a
plausible number that every per-leaf oracle in the tree still blesses.  The
only gate that can see it is the whole call: :func:`woof.core.noahmp_sflx
.sflx` driven per column on the host -- the routine the unmodified-WRF
whole-column fixture pins -- against :func:`evaluate_sflx_slab` on the same
columns, **every output field, bitwise**.

The columns are the four ``noahmp-sflx.csv`` cases crossed with forcing
variants, so the slab carries vegetated and bare tiles, day and night, deep
snowpack and none, frozen and unfrozen soil **in one call** -- the mixed
population a real nest hands the orchestration, where a compaction defect
(VEGE_FLUX's gather/scatter) actually has room to misroute.

Two negative controls, because a comparison that has never failed proves
nothing: one input field rolled onto the neighbouring column, and two soil
parameter slabs transposed.  Both must be *visible* -- rejected by the field
comparison or by the balance aborts, either of which is a detection.
