"""The frame header carries a machine-independent identity.

The breakage this names: a canonical frame header quotes, per field, the
sha256 of that field's array bytes AND the absolute paths the arrays came
from.  Two boxes decoding the same published bytes therefore produce two
different header digests, for two reasons that are both facts about the
box and not about the decode:

1. the input paths differ (a checkout, a staging tree, a drive letter);
2. a field produced through a TRANSCENDENTAL takes its last bits from
   the box's libm.  Measured 2026-08-20, same bytes on the Windows
   desktop (UCRT) and a development machine (glibc): on the netCDF sample
   committed beside the crate goldens, 35 of 38 arrays are identical to
   the bit and the three the two ``exp``-based humidity derivations
   produce are at most 3 ULP apart -- 4.1e-16 relative; on the Lambert
   case, all four wind components move, because the grid-relative wind
   rotation is ``sin``/``cos``.

So a golden recorded on one box fails on another while every decoded
number is right.  The remedy is a second, DECLARED digest that both
engines emit beside the raw one: input paths reduced to basenames, and
each libm-dependent field's array digest replaced by ``libm:<name>``.
The raw digest keeps its meaning -- what THIS box measured -- and the
portable one is what a golden may assert.
