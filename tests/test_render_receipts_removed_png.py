"""A picture removed after it was published does not block the next render.

Breakage this prevents: every render publication re-verifies the pictures of
every earlier invocation in the folder, and one earlier PNG removed by hand
made each later publication fail with "Render receipt names no regular PNG
inside its output directory", after the new pictures were already drawn.
