"""Arm 2's instrument, pinned against the rows it must reproduce.

`TC-INTENSITY.md:3178` records a table this campaign already acted on --
it is the evidence that Kain-Fritsch buys its 62% pressure recovery by
destroying the outer rainbands, and therefore the reason New Tiedtke was
ported at all.  The table was produced ad hoc; no script in
``tools/tc-intensity-diagnostics/`` emitted it.

``annulus_condensate.py`` is that script, written for Phase 5's arm 2.
Its correctness claim is not "the code looks right" -- it is that the
same code reproduces all three published rows from the three runs that
produced them, and these tests are that claim.

WHY THIS MATTERS MORE THAN A UNIT TEST OF THE ARITHMETIC.  Two things in
the metric were NOT recoverable from the prose and had to be recovered by
validation:

  * which species count as "precipitating condensate" (rain + snow +
    graupel, excluding cloud water and cloud ice); and
  * what "banded area" thresholds against -- an absolute cut-off in kg/m2
    cannot reproduce the rows at all, because the published fractions are
    near-equal across schemes (13.7 / 14.7 / 14.9%) while the means differ
    2.3x.  It is TWICE THE ANNULUS MEAN, a relative measure.

A wrong choice on either would have produced a plausible number for the
New Tiedtke run and no way to notice.  Phase 5's arm 2 fails the phase on
its own, so the instrument had to be graded before the run it grades.
