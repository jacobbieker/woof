# tests/test_small_step_lateral_wrap.py
"""The small-step uv kernels must obey the configured lateral boundary.

What was wrong
--------------
``small_step_init_uv`` and ``small_step_finish_uv`` build WRF's ``muu``/
``muus`` and ``muv``/``muvs`` inline -- the column mass carried to a u/v
face as the mean of the two mass cells that share it, which
``small_step_prep`` multiplies into the acoustic perturbation
(module_small_step_em.F:225-228) and ``small_step_finish`` divides back out
(:96-98).  WRF builds that pair in ``calc_mu_uv``
(module_big_step_utilities_em.F:59-115 for x, :118-174 for y) and picks the
off-domain neighbour from ``config_flags%periodic_x``/``periodic_y``::

    west face i = ids:   im = its   ; periodic_x -> its-1
    east face i = ide:   im = ite-1 ; periodic_x -> ite

The periodic branch reads the halo cell the period fill has loaded from the
opposite edge; the non-periodic branch names the boundary cell twice, so the
boundary face carries that cell's own mass.  WOOF wrapped unconditionally
(``i % nx`` / ``(i-1+nx) % nx``, and the j equivalent) regardless of
``open_x``/``open_y``/``specified``/``nested``, so on every non-periodic
domain the west boundary face took its mass from the EAST-most mass column
and the east face from the west-most -- a physical coupling of the two
boundaries, present at both ends of every acoustic rung of every RK stage.
These were the last two sites where a wrapped index SURVIVED on a
non-periodic domain.  Every other boundary-sensitive kernel already takes
the flag (``slow_pgf`` skips the boundary face, ``advance_mu_th`` and
``stage_fluxes`` clamp, the advection family and ``smag2d`` narrow); the one
remaining ``i % nx`` -- ``advance_uv``'s -- is dead at the boundary either
way, because its spec_zone guard never reaches the boundary face under
specified/nested and ``acoustic.py`` overwrites both boundary face sets from
their saved pre-substep values under open boundaries
(``openbc_upp_faces``/``openbc_vpp_faces``).

What this file pins
-------------------
* :func:`test_uv_kernels_match_wrf_calc_mu_uv` -- the ORACLE.  An FP32 NumPy
  mirror of the two kernels' arithmetic (every ``rn_*`` op is one
  round-to-nearest FP32 binary operation, which is exactly what NumPy does
  on float32 arrays, and neither side contracts) is compared bit-for-bit for
  a periodic, a specified and an open config, with and without map factors.
  The periodic rows are the wrap; the non-periodic rows are the clamp.
* :func:`test_periodic_uv_is_exactly_the_wrap` -- the bit-identity gate for
  every existing periodic run: the kernel under a periodic config must equal
  the same kernel with the flags forced to the wrap, AND must differ from
  the same kernel with the flags forced to the clamp.  A test whose two
  branches cannot be told apart proves nothing, so the second half is what
  makes the first half mean something.
* :func:`test_one_step_does_not_couple_the_opposite_edge` -- the NEGATIVE
  CONTROL, and the one that fails on the unpatched kernel.  One mass column
  at the west edge of a 96-cell-wide domain is bumped by 25 Pa and the
  domain is stepped ONCE; nothing in the eastern 8 columns may move.  A step
  reaches 16 cells (``tilestream.harness.halo_radius``), so 88 cells of
  separation is five influence cones: only a wrap can carry the signal.
  Measured at 684bcd5 (the unpatched kernel), 96x64x24, dt=3 s, over all
  76 device arrays the state owns -- far-edge arrays that moved (and cells
  within them), x axis / y axis::

      periodic    33 (261174) / 33 (392525)   <- MUST couple
      specified    1 (21)     /  1 (20)       <- must not
      open        34 (143108) / 34 (210667)   <- must not

  With the fix the two lower rows are 0 arrays and the periodic row is
  unchanged.  The specified row is small because the spec-zone epilogue
  overwrites the boundary-face u the wrap corrupted; what survives is the
  stage mass flux ``rk_ru``/``rk_rv``, one float32 ULP in each of those 21
  and 20 cells.  The PERIODIC row is the positive control -- there the far
  edge MUST move, which is what proves the probe can see coupling at all.
