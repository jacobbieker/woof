"""The ledger auditor must FAIL on the ledgers it exists to catch.

``tools/relocation_ledger_audit.py`` is the evidence instrument for a
moving-nest run: it turns "the run looked clean" into a re-derivable
statement about the artifact.  An auditor that passes everything is
worse than none, so every invariant it claims gets a ledger here that
violates exactly that one invariant and nothing else.

Two of these cases are the auditor's own bugs, kept as tests because
each was a real wrong answer first:

* the placement chain must be walked in LEDGER-TIME order with the
  containment slide before the mover consultation at a shared instant
  (relocation_runner.on_period_begin, commit 6802bb4d).  Walking the
  mover's rows alone reads every slide as a break;
* a centroid lives in the mover's-parent frame, and a slide moves that
  frame.  Comparing across a slide without translating reads a
  stationary storm as a jump of ratio x slide cells -- the same frame
  confusion commit 1f46814c fixed inside the runner.
