"""Which per-toolchain row a GPU parity table reads, after A146.

The MYNN tables keep one row per (compute capability, NVRTC major.minor)
that reads differently from the table's default (the sm_86 and sm_89
reading).  Before A146 an unlisted toolchain fell back to the default
silently.  That is wrong on Blackwell: NVRTC compiled every float division
by a compile-time constant there as a multiply by the rounded reciprocal
(tools/literal_division_census.py: compute_100 and compute_120, every NVRTC
measured, 12.9 to 13.4), the kernels now spell those divisions
``__fdiv_rn``, and the sm_120 rows were re-recorded after the fix under
NVRTC 13.4 (A167 then measured 12.9.86 reading them word for word and
keyed it to the same rows).  No other architecture's row and nothing
recorded before the fix describes a Blackwell compile under another NVRTC.

So on those architectures a toolchain with no row does not fall back:
an architecture with a row under some other NVRTC FAILS naming this
compiler (it is unmeasured, the Shin-Hong table's rule), and an
architecture with no row at all SKIPS naming itself (a gate that fails for
the card and not the code prevents no breakage; the release card stage
names the skip in its receipt).  Everywhere else the default row stands.

"Those architectures" are every compute capability of major 10 or above,
not a list of the parts someone measured (A167).  The list read only
compute_100 and compute_120, so a B300 (10.3), a Thor (11.0) or a GB10
(12.1) fell through to the sm_86/89 default row as if it were Ampere or
Ada.  MEASURED 2026-10-01 on a development machine, CPU only, x / 3.0f and x / 60.0f under
-ftz=true: NVRTC 12.9.86 and 13.4.92 both compile them as a multiply by the
rounded reciprocal for every compute_100, 101, 103, 110, 120 and 121 they
accept (12.9.86 has no compute_110, 13.4.92 no compute_101), and keep
div.rn for compute_75 through compute_90.
