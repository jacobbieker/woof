"""The RUC column with its four arithmetic leaves on the card.

Batching ``LSMRUC``'s ``DO i`` (see ``tests/test_ruc_column_batching.py``)
took the host column from 1.711 to 0.479 ms warm and from 3.261 to 1.254 over
snow, and left it **flat**.  That flatness is the point: what remains is
genuine per-element work, and ``cProfile`` over the batched call names it --
``ruc_soil_properties`` 45%, ``ruc_soil_moisture_step`` 16%,
``_ruc_phase_partition`` 11%, ``ruc_soil_temperature_step`` 11%,
``_ruc_vilka`` 5%.  Every one of those sits inside ``ruc_soil_step`` or
``ruc_snow_soil_step``, both of which have had oracle-matched CUDA leaves for
weeks with nothing able to launch them at width.

Batching is what made them reachable.  ``ruc_surface_temperature_step`` now
takes a ``leaves`` mapping, and ``woof.core.ruc_gpu.RUC_SFCTMP_DEVICE_LEAVES``
is the device set.  This file is the evidence that using it does not change
the answer.

The gates, in the order they matter:

1. the CUDA and host result dataclasses agree field for field and in order,
   which is what makes the host-facing wrapper a rename-free transfer rather
   than a mapping nobody checks;
2. the device leaves reproduce the host leaves **bitwise** on a whole
   ``sfctmp`` call -- max ULP is reported, not assumed;
3. a six-step driver trajectory with the device leaves is bitwise against
   the same trajectory on the host, warm and snow-covered, with water and
   sea-ice columns present; and
4. the per-column cost across the published widths, so "is it still flat"
   is answered with a number.

Every comparison is paired in-process against the same tree.  A device run
compared against a recorded digest would also pass if both had drifted.
