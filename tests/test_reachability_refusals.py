"""Refusals that used to be tracebacks, false statements, or absent.

Four rows of the 2.3.2 reachability audit, each a different way for a
shipped feature to be unreachable, and each guarded here against the
exact defect that was measured.

**A refusal must never state something false.**  The DA nowcast one-command
path downloaded two NEXRAD Level-II volumes and then died with
``woof domain: --polygon local GeoJSON file does not exist:
danow_full\\case\\domain-box.geojson`` -- for a file that was on disk, 243
bytes, written by the survey stage one step earlier.  The cause was a
relative ``--out``: every stage runs as a subprocess with
``cwd=repo_root``, so the parent wrote the polygon under the CALLER's
working directory and ``woof domain`` looked for the same relative path
under ``site-packages``.  Two things are guarded: the path is absolute
before the survey spends a byte, and the message names the path the
process actually looked at plus the directory it resolved against, so a
`cd`-shaped bug identifies itself instead of sending the reader hunting.

**A refusal must arrive before the expensive work.**  The
``--domain-polygon`` existence check ran after the download, so "you named
a missing file" cost the user two radar volumes.

**A case that needs data nobody ships must say so.**  ``woof verify
real74_d01`` raised a twenty-line ``FileNotFoundError`` at exit 1, and
raised it INSTEAD of the clean CuPy refusal every other verify case
gives, because the missing namelist is reached before the first ``import
cupy``.

**A remedy must be reachable and must be true.**  The LES tornado case
modules ran a config audit before argparse, so ``--help`` itself failed;
the config they wanted is under ``configs/``, which is not a package and
is in no wheel; and the remedy they printed -- "pass the experiment .toml
that `woof domain` wrote" -- named a file the wizard does not emit and a
flag the module did not have.
