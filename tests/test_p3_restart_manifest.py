"""The DomainState attributes the P3 device adapter grows must be classified.

WHAT THIS PREVENTS, concretely and measured on 2026-08-29: the CUDA port's
``woof/core/p3.py::apply`` caches its device workspace as
``state._p3_workspace``.  ``woof/io/restart.py::classify_state_attr``
refuses any DomainState attribute it does not know -- by design, so new
state cannot silently skip the restart stream.  The two together meant the
FIRST mp=50 device step made the state unclassifiable, and every mp=50
forecast died with

    RestartManifestError: DomainState attribute '_p3_workspace' is not
    classified in the restart manifest

inside ``canonical_state_digest`` before it could write its first history
frame.  No checkpoint could be written either.

``tests/test_restart.py::test_every_domainstate_attribute_is_classified``
is parametrized with ``mp_physics=50`` and passed throughout, because its
shim state never calls ``p3.apply`` and therefore never grows the
attribute.  These tests close that gap from the other side: the CPU one
names the attributes by source, and the GPU one in
``tests/test_p3_restart_manifest_gpu.py`` runs a real step and classifies
what the run actually produced.

    for "this key is on one side only".  That sentinel reached the message

    refused, and the ``differences`` list is unchanged in length.
