"""A larger card must buy a larger domain, and a bound that binds must say so.

`_MAX_SCALE` was an undocumented ceiling on the wizard's scale bisection.  Its
sibling `_MIN_SCALE` carries a full rationale in the source ("the smallest
layout that still hosts the deepest ladder with full Davies/blend clearance");
`_MAX_SCALE` carried none, and was introduced in the wizard's first commit with
no justification.  At 8.0 it bound for every single-domain budget at or above
64 GiB, so 64, 96 and 180 GiB all emitted the identical 880x704 root while
reporting a comfortable fit -- a 180 GiB card sized like a 64 GiB one, with the
difference silently unused.

The bug was invisible from any single invocation.  Nothing in the wizard's
output distinguished "this is the largest grid your budget affords" from "this
is the largest grid I was willing to consider", which is why it survived until
someone ran the wizard twice at different budgets and compared.

Both properties are tested here: budgets buy grids, and saturation is audible.

    Restated in 2.5.0, because memory stopped being the only bound the
    fit answers to.  A 12 km root sized for a 64 GiB card spans more
    longitude than one crop of a global source can serve, and the fit
    now shrinks against that limit instead of emitting a layout its own
    emission would refuse.  Restated again in 2.7.3, which gave the
    POINT fit two bounds of its own -- the extent a centre with no
    extent is sized to, and the projection's polar envelope -- so the
    stall on this ladder is now request-shaped and arrives sooner.  So
    saturation is legitimate here -- what is not legitimate, and what
    this file exists for, is saturation nobody can see.  Every stall
    must therefore be REPORTED, and a bigger card must buy more grid up
    to the point where one does.

    Reported, not warned: the two request-shaped bounds are the DEFAULT
    sizing of a request that carries no extent, so they bind on the
    ordinary mid-latitude point on any card from about 16 GiB up, and a
    stderr ``warning:`` on the normal case is its own defect (it turned
    ``tests/test_go_chain.py`` red on the door's default emission).  The
    fit hands the bound to its caller in ``stop_out`` and the door
    states it as one line of plan summary; a source-shaped ceiling,
    which is not the normal case, keeps its warning.  Both are visible,
    which is the property this file is about.

    its 3 km nest keeps the root well short of every non-memory bound,
