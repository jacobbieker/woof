"""``woof doctor``'s verdict on the radar front door (``rw_nexrad``).

This line exists because the report used to pass without it.  ``rw_nexrad``
sat outside both audited sets -- it is not a GRIB bridge and not a render
engine -- so ``woof doctor`` printed a clean estate on installs where every
radar route was dead, and the first news a user got came from the launcher
refusing to print a plan.  A doctor that passes on a box that cannot do the
thing is worse than no doctor, which is what these tests pin.

Two failures are distinguished on purpose, because their remedies differ:

* **absent** -- nothing to point at; get one (bundle or build);
* **stale** -- a binary that exists, launches, and reports the wrong
  ``--abi`` contract.  Both the current and the superseded binary answer
  ``--version`` with the same ``rw_nexrad 0.1.0``, so version is not a
  discriminator and "point it at the other copy you have" is the one piece
  of advice guaranteed to waste a user's time.  The remedy must say
  *rebuild*.

Every branch is forced here rather than left to whatever this box has, and
none of them touches the GPU: this file must stay cheap on a contended card,
which is why it is separate from ``tests/test_doctor.py``.
