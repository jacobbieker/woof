"""The slabbed store builder refuses BEFORE it pins anything.

THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR
--------------------------
``tilestream.hoststore.check_allocatable`` is a fail-closed budget refusal
with three independent gates, and the class-based store path has always
called it (``hoststore.py``, ``PinnedStore``).
``tilestream.bigdomain.build_store_by_slabs`` is the newer road to the same
place and it never did: it allocated pinned arrays a slab at a time with
nothing between the request and the machine.

MEASURED, and this is why it is not a style point: a real store reached
**87.8 GiB of page-locked RAM in silence**, past the documented ceiling,
and starved every other lane on the box.  Pinned pages cannot be swapped, so
the failure mode is not a run that dies -- it is a machine that stops
serving anybody, which is what happened.

The same defect CLASS as the streaming front-door work this landed beside: a
newer engineering path that skips a guard the older path carries.

WHY "BEFORE" IS THE WHOLE ASSERTION.  A guard that fires while allocating
has already taken most of what it is refusing, and page-locked memory taken
is not given back until the process exits.  So these tests assert that ZERO
allocations happened, not merely that an exception was raised.

    names both functions, in the WRONG order, seventy lines above the code,
    and escapes a substring search today only because it happens to write
    them without their parentheses -- which is not a property anyone should
    have to preserve while editing a docstring.

    assertion wants the first of ALL of them.  Both builders allocate in two
    separate loops (carriers, then geography); a guard moved between them
