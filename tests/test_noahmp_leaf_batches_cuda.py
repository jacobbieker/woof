"""Every device leaf batch, against the host authority, on real paused calls.

The per-leaf CUDA tests in this tree drive each kernel from its own oracle CSV
through a hand-built flat row.  That gates the *arithmetic* and says nothing
about the packing the runtime actually uses, which is a different piece of code
and the one a whole-column conversion adds.  This file closes that gap for all
seven batched leaves at once:

1. run the four unmodified-WRF whole-column fixtures through ``sflx_steps``,
   the generator the runtime uses, and record every physical leaf call it
   pauses at, together with the answer the CPython leaf gives;
2. hand those same call tuples to the device batch; and
3. require every returned number to be bit identical.

A packer that reads the wrong keyword, writes the wrong slot, or transposes two
layers fails here and nowhere else.  ``test_the_batch_comparison_can_fail``
shows the comparison rejecting exactly those defects before any of it counts as
evidence.
