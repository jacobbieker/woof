"""ERA5's native model-level atmosphere is a registry ROW, not a route.

The hybrid closure taught both engines to read a GRIB2 Section-4 pv
coordinate ladder, materialize ``p = A + B*ps`` from it, and integrate
geopotential height hydrostatically up the resulting half levels.  That
is engine work and it is done.  What was still missing is the thing a
user actually needs: a NAME.  Until this row existed, initializing from
ERA5's 137 native model levels meant hand-authoring a mapping, a
composition, a donor mapping and a sealed manifest outside the product
and driving ``woof.mapped_direct`` by hand -- engine-proven, not
shipped.

These tests hold the arbitrary acceptance test at the place it is
easiest to break: the difference between "woof can decode ERA5 model
levels" and "``era5-l137`` is selectable like any other source" must be
table data -- three pinned JSON authorities plus one ``_adapter(...)``
row -- and never a runner, a module, or a branch that names this model.
