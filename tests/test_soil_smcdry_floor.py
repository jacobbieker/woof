"""The SMCDRY floor for sub-physical ERA5 land soil moisture.

The defect this pins: an ERA5 swvl value a hair below zero (GRIB packing,
interpolation undershoot) was admitted by the overshoot band and clipped
to EXACTLY 0.0 on a land point.  Noah's thermal conductivity divides by
SMC (TDFCND: ``xunfroz = sh2o/smc``, the ``ake`` divide,
``powf(smcmax/smc, bexp)``), so ONE such cell was NaN conductivity ->
NaN GRDFLX -> NaN HFX and the run died at step 0 blamed on the PBL
scheme.  The threshold was a hard zero: 1e-12 survived, 0.0 did not.

The fix floors each land layer below the soil category's SMCDRY (air-dry,
SOILPARM.TBL DRYSMC) to that SMCDRY.  WRF v4.6.1 real.exe instead resets
the whole column to the constant 0.005 when the TOP layer is below 0.005
(dyn_em/module_initialize_real.F:3363-3395); the divergence ledger lives
on woof.ingest.soil._floor_land_moisture_at_smcdry.
