"""Seam B: a spawn declaration is honored or refused, never dropped.

``woof.experiment.refuse_unrouted_spawn`` existed with zero production
callers -- the guard was written but never mounted, so every route that
neither RESERVES a dormant nest's VRAM nor WATCHES its trigger would
quietly integrate without the nest the user declared.  This pins the
mounting: one real refusal through a front door that is a pure
function, and a source audit over the rest, so a route added later
cannot skip the governance by accident.

The audit is deliberately a source scan rather than a call through each
front door: those routes need prepared caches, sealed manifests and
GPUs to reach their experiment, and the thing worth pinning is that the
guard is PRESENT at admission, which is exactly what the scan sees.
