"""Unit and correctness gates for :mod:`woof.da.letkf`.

The centrepiece is :func:`test_letkf_equals_dense_kalman_gain`, which checks
the batched transform against an independent, deliberately naive
implementation of the same mathematics by a completely different route: an
explicit dense Kalman gain, one gridpoint at a time, with the localised
observation set found by brute-force distance search over the whole domain
rather than by the module's index stencil.  The two share no code beyond
:func:`gaspari_cohn` itself, so agreement is evidence rather than tautology,
and the brute-force neighbour search validates the stencil construction as a
side effect.

That the two must agree is not an approximation.  By the Sherman-Morrison-
Woodbury identity,

    Xb [(R-1)I + Yb^T Rloc^-1 Yb]^-1 Yb^T Rloc^-1
      = Xb Yb^T [(R-1) Rloc + Yb Yb^T]^-1
      = Pb H^T (H Pb H^T + Rloc)^-1 = K,

so the LETKF mean increment IS the Kalman increment, exactly, and the ETKF
analysis covariance IS (I - KH) Pb.  A test that only checked "the RMSE went
down" would pass with a gain that was half the right size.
