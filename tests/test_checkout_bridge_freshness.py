"""A checkout's own bridge build, measured against the tree it serves.

Reported from the field against 2.7.4/2.7.5: after `git pull` the
binary at `tools/rustwx/target/release/rw_netcdf` was the previous
release's, and the first thing that said so was a decode failure inside
`woof run`.  Nothing on the resolution ladder had asked whether the
build was current: the contract marker (`BRIDGE_ABI_MARKERS`) only
answers when somebody remembers to change it, and it is identical
across 2.7.4, 2.7.5 and 2.7.6 while the Rust under it moved.

The judgement here is cargo's own and needs no cooperation from the
build that already happened: is any file the binary is compiled from
newer than the binary?  It is asked about one KIND OF FILE rather than
about one rung: a binary under this installation's own
`target/{release,debug}`, which is a checkout build whether the ladder
walked to it or `WOOF_RW_NETCDF` named it.  A wheel, a `libexec`
directory, a fetched bundle and an override naming a built copy
anywhere else have no sources here and are untouched by it.
