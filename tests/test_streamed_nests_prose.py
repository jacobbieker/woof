"""What the streaming-x-nesting seam actually does, pinned to the capability.

``refuse_streamed_nests`` is the last trace of a refusal that no longer
exists: it ignores nesting entirely and refuses only a moving ``[relocation]``
domain configured with ``tiles.store = 'device'``.  Several comment blocks
went on asserting a load-time refusal of ``[tiles] mode = 'on'`` over a
domain tree, and one of them named a second refusal -- an edge with BOTH
ends streamed in ``NestCoupler.force`` -- that no code has ever made.

These tests are written in the house style of the other source-pinning
gates: assert the presence of the SEAM, not merely the absence of a string,
so deleting the capability cannot make them pass.
