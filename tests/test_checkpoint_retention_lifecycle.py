"""Checkpoint retention judges each set by the domains its own header declares.

Breakage these prevent: once a live nest retired, every later checkpoint set
held fewer members than the largest set on disk, so none of them counted as
complete and retention stopped pruning for the rest of the run (nine sets
were left where one was kept).  The same rule let a torn new set, whose
children were written before its root, stand in for an older whole set of
the same size, and the whole set was removed.
