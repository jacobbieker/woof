"""What a runtime-spawned nest records as its own activation epoch.

A nest that activates LATE has always been a supported shape: a domain
may declare ``start_time`` and join the run hours in, and task #205 built
the machinery every consumer reads that epoch through -- the history
alarm, the REFL_10CM handoff, the schedule's activation bookkeeping and
the physics step counter that decides whether radiation is due.

A nest that is SPAWNED activates late too, and until this module's
subject was fixed it recorded no epoch at all.  ``active_experiment``
replaced the fired placement and nothing else, so the newborn's clock
resolved ``start_ticks = 0`` -- it claimed to have started with the
experiment.  Two shipped failures fell straight out of that one missing
number, and both are pinned below:

* its first history frame consumed a REFL_10CM stash no step of that
  domain had produced, and
* its first step was numbered as though it had been running since t = 0,
  so ``_radiation_step_due`` said radiation was not due and Noah then
  consumed a GLW buffer nothing had ever written.

The last two tests hold the other direction: the forcing-seam rule that
a CONFIG-scheduled delayed start must obey is not relaxed for it.
