"""The nocturnal-radiation guard and the wizard's nocturnally sane default.

Provenance: a wizard-emitted 48 h real case bound
``thompson-mp8-ysu-mm5-noah-validation-v1`` (ra_lw_physics 0,
ra_sw_physics 1).  Shortwave heated the surface by day; at night the
surface radiated with no downward longwave, skin temperature cratered
and 2 m dewpoints read in the 50s F inside a 70s airmass.  Two fixes,
both bound here:

* the wizard's real-case default is a certified full lw+sw profile
  (registry maturity read off the registry, never asserted);
* any real experiment whose window includes local night refuses to LOAD
  an undeclared shortwave-on/longwave-off pairing, at the one loader
  every front door shares, with the physics, the profile and both
  remedies named.

The instrument is tested in both directions (a night window trips, a
daylight window does not) because a guard that cannot pass is as wrong
as one that cannot fire.
