"""A card reading that decides something does not count this process's garbage as used.

Admission, tile planning and the ensemble pack are all sized from a free
figure read off the card. Arrays reachable only through a reference cycle
(a finished forecast's driver/state attachment is one) stay allocated until
the cyclic collector happens to run, and the default pool keeps the blocks
of earlier work cached; ``cudaMemGetInfo`` counts both as used. The release
gate's one-process GPU shard showed what that costs: after the two
member-sources ensemble tests, the native decline gate read 2.87 GiB free on
a card held to 15 GiB and its first member was refused, and in another run
its four-member native pack was admitted as two packs. Run alone, it passed.

Each test here builds that garbage on purpose, with the collector held off,
and checks every shared reading against a reading taken without it. A
control asserts the garbage really occupies the card first, so a test that
silently stopped making garbage cannot pass.
