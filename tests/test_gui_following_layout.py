"""A storm-following Customise runs the event's own layout, on this computer or on a Machines node.

The defects this file holds shut:

- The page carried the cyclone setup's options itself and a start ran
  whatever it was sent. The layout is now read from the storm wiki by its
  event and card size, as the event page's button runs it, and a box or
  grid of the page's own is refused rather than drawn and never run.
- A storm-following start could not run on a Machines node: the
  configuration and the Vtable and WPS namelist it names were written on
  this computer only, and the node's plan named files it never had.
- A storm-following plan named no pictures, and a configuration file's run
  draws none unless its plan says so, so the forecast finished with nothing
  to show. The event page's own start of the same layout drew none either.
- A layout whose nest has a fixed size had its nest grown to the card.
- Two tabs starting one name both answered 200, and the second plan
  replaced the first under a run already started.
- A queued Machines start could write into any folder it was pointed at;
  only the folder the queue hands over as starting is taken.
