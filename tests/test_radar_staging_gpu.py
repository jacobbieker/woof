"""Device staging of an observation batch's reach window, on a real card.

THE DEFECT.  ``woof.da.radar_assimilation.assimilate_radar_grid`` stages
every batch onto the device by rebuilding
:class:`~woof.da.letkf.GriddedObs` field by field, and the rebuild dropped
``window``.  ``woof.da.obs_radar`` builds velocity batches from a v2
reach-window document with window-sized arrays and the window that names
them, so on the accelerator those arrays reached the filter declaring no
window at all.  ``woof.da.letkf`` sizes every batch array against the
declaration it is given, so it raised ``LetkfError`` on a shape it had
itself produced, and a windowed document could not be assimilated on a
card.  The CPU arm never rebuilds a batch and was never affected, which is
exactly why a CPU leg cannot ask this question.

``tests/test_local_da_integration.py::test_accelerator_staging_preserves_observation_window``
pins the same contract on stage 1 with a stand-in device namespace whose
``asarray`` is numpy's.  A stand-in cannot show that the real transfer
preserves the declaration, and the transfer is the step that dropped it.

The two halves here are the two halves of the defect: that the staging
carries ``window`` across a real cupy transfer, and that the filter on the
card needs that declaration, so dropping it is what raised.
