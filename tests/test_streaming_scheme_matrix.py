"""Every composition the registry accepts can be STREAMED, or says why not.

THE DEFECT CLASS THIS EXISTS FOR
--------------------------------
``[tiles]`` streaming rebuilds a per-buffer twin of each physics adapter
(``woof.core.streaming._tile_scheme``).  An adapter it cannot rebuild stops
the run inside ``TiledRun.__init__`` -- after the prepared cache has been
restored, the domain built on the card and the tile buffers allocated.

That is exactly how the shipped DEFAULT suite shipped broken.
``RRTMGLegacyRadiation`` is a plain class whose constructor requires
``start_time``/``latitude_deg``/``longitude_deg``, the twin builder handled
only dataclasses and empty constructors, and so every ``[tiles]`` forecast
of the default physics selected ``StreamingRefused``.  Nothing caught it
because no test in the tree asked the question of the SHIPPED SCHEMES; the
twinning tests all used stand-ins that were dataclasses by construction.

So this suite asks the question of the registry itself, programmatically.
It enumerates ``woof/physics_registry_v2.json`` rather than naming suites,
so a scheme added to the registry tomorrow is audited the day it is added,
and a scheme added WITHOUT a tile constructor goes red here -- on CPU, in
the ordinary battery -- instead of an hour into somebody's forecast.

WHY THIS IS THE COMPLETE AUDIT, not merely the radiation one.  A physics
suite selects seven components, and only TWO of them install an adapter
OBJECT that a buffer must be given: ``PhysicsDriver.__init__`` assigns
``radiation_callable`` and ``cumulus_callable``
(``woof/core/physics.py:1827-1828``) and nothing else.  The other five --
microphysics, PBL, surface layer, land surface, turbulence -- are selected
by ``initialize_physics`` from the config, so a tile buffer built from the
domain's own ``cfg`` selects them identically, and their state travels as
ordinary carriers through the store.  The radiation and cumulus adapters are
handed over explicitly precisely BECAUSE they carry policy the config does
not replay (trace-gas overrides, ``column_chunk``, ``o3input``).
:func:`test_the_twinned_slots_are_still_exactly_two` holds that fact, so
this audit's scope cannot silently narrow.
