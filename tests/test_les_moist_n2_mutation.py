"""The moist-N2 mutation control: wiring, isolation, and that it bites.

CPU-only.  No device is opened: the build variant is checked as a SOURCE
assembly and a cache-key property, and that the mutation actually changes
the answer is measured on the float64 mirror, which is the same branch
under the same predicate.

The control exists because the LES completion program spec §3.3 says a
scratch build with the saturated BN2 switch forced to the dry branch must
move the committed cloud-layer metrics, and that **if it does not, the
instrument is rejected, not the engine passed**.  An instrument that
cannot fail cannot pass anything.

The failure mode these tests are really aimed at is the quiet one.
``load_module`` is ``lru_cache``d on the module name alone, so a control
arm wired through it would be handed the ORIGINAL, UNMUTATED module and
would report -- truthfully, and catastrophically -- that the mutation
changes nothing.  That is a false clean bill of health for the
instrument, so the cache-key discrimination is tested directly rather than
assumed from reading the loader.
