"""``LSMRUC``'s ``DO i`` is a batching, and batching it must not move a bit.

``woof.core.ruc.ruc_land_surface_step`` was transcribed the way WRF is
written: a Python ``for i in range(ncolumn)`` calling
:func:`~woof.core.ruc.ruc_surface_temperature_step` once per column with
one-element arrays.  ``sfctmp`` and every leaf under it are already written
over a column axis, so that loop paid ``sfctmp``'s fixed per-call cost once
per column -- 360,000 times for a production nest.  Measured on the reference
box before the conversion: 1.687 ms/column at 48 columns and 1.724 at 24,576.

The prologue, the water and sea-ice arms and the epilogue now run over the
whole column axis, and ``SFCTMP`` is called ONCE for all land columns.  This
file is what says that did not change the answer.

The claims are deliberately configuration-independent, because a recorded
digest is a property of one fixture on one box:

* **partition invariance** -- one call over N columns equals the
  concatenation of calls over any disjoint split of the same columns.  This
  is the strongest available statement that the batch is not coupling
  columns, and it needs no reference implementation to compare against.
* **order independence** -- permuting the columns permutes the answer and
  changes nothing else.
* **the two batchings agree** -- ``ilnb_chain=True`` still dispatches one
  column at a time (the chain is a genuine sequential dependence), so on a
  grid where no column's ``ilnb`` is ever read the chained and batched paths
  must be bitwise equal.  That is a paired host authority, in-process,
  against the same tree.

Each carries a falsification that is shown to fail.

    0.479 at 24,576 warm; 1.322 and 1.254 snow-covered.  Against 1.711 and
    3.261 before, that is 3.6x warm and 2.6x over snow -- and a spread of
    1.13x and 1.06x, so the cost is **still flat**.

    Flatness surviving the conversion is the finding, not a disappointment:
    it says the residue is genuine per-element work rather than per-call
    overhead, and it is the per-element Python loops inside
    ``ruc_soil_properties``, ``ruc_soil_moisture_step``,
    ``_ruc_phase_partition``, ``ruc_soil_temperature_step`` and
    ``_ruc_vilka`` -- every one of which has a CUDA leaf already.

    The bound is loose because the absolute number belongs to the host.  What
    makes flatness a measurement rather than an assertion is the control.
