"""A staged bridge that is not this release's binary never reaches a door.

The defect these bind, measured on 2026-09-01 against the published
2.6.1: ``~/.woof/bridges`` held ``rw_mpas_mesh.exe`` stamped
``c8883473...`` (the v2.5.3 tag, staged in August), the wheel's own pins
declared 2,679,808 B stamped ``8b9f89f1...``, ``woof doctor`` printed
the mismatch as a BROKEN line -- and every door's resolution ladder went
on handing the August binary to the routes, because nothing between the
ladder and the door read the verdict.  The mesh door's gradient
predicate then came back false against a binary with no gradient meter
in it, and ten gates in the hex battery reported skipped rather than
failed.

What is bound here is the shape of the answer, not one artifact:

* a STAGED artifact whose bytes are not the pinned ones is refreshed
  (default) or refused BY NAME (offline), at the ladder;
* an environment override, an in-tree build and both ``libexec`` rungs
  are never judged, because none of them is the rung a ``pip install
  -U`` leaves behind;
* a matching artifact resolves exactly as before, and touches nothing;
* ``woof doctor`` reports the same verdict the doors act on, and
  reporting it never fetches or refuses.

Nothing here fabricates a hash: every pin is computed from bytes these
tests just wrote, and every refresh stages a real zip built here.
