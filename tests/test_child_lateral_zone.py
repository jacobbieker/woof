"""A downscaled child's lateral zone is sized for its parent, not for itself.

The defect: ``woof downscale`` copied the parent's root-domain lateral
settings into every derived child -- spec_bdy_width 5, spec_zone 1,
relax_zone 4 -- and those count CHILD cells.  At ratio 12 or 20 the whole
zone was 1.25 km or 0.75 km, narrower than one 3 km parent cell, and
``w`` was never relaxed, only copied onto the boundary from the first
interior row.  The children made their own storms on their edges.  The
derived zone's time scale is set in seconds (one child cell crossed at
20 m/s), which the 2 h arms chose over the parent's own 150 s.

These are the CPU halves of the fix: the derived configuration, the
coefficient law, the identity bookkeeping and the tile planning rule that
a zone wider than a tile halo needs.  The GPU halves (the kernel's side
mask and the w relaxation) are in tests/test_child_edge_relaxation_gpu.py.
