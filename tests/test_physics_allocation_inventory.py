"""Can a physics scheme allocate its working set outside the arena again?

This is the ratchet that ``tests/test_mynn_pbl_scratch.py`` opened, and it
exists because MYNN got all the way to a production-width timing measurement
while allocating **54,595 bytes per column in 484 pool allocations per step**
that no part of the preflight knew about.  At the 360,000 columns of a d04
nest that is 18,743.8 MiB per step against an estimate that did not move at
all.  The failure mode is not slowness.  It is that ``run_alloc_preflight``
returns a comfortable headroom number for a configuration that will run the
card out of memory, on hardware with no ECC, where the observed symptom of
running out is corrupted output rather than an exception.

WHY IT IS A SEPARATE FILE
-------------------------
Every gate here reads source with :mod:`ast` and opens no device.  It used to
live in ``tests/test_mynn_pbl_scratch.py``, whose ``_carried_hash`` helper
imports cupy -- and ``tests/conftest.py`` marks a WHOLE module ``gpu`` when any
non-test function in it imports cupy, deliberately, because which tests call a
helper is not decidable from the AST.  So a purely static, fully deterministic
gate was skipped on every ``GPUWM_NO_LOCAL_GPU=1`` run, which is every routine
run on this machine.

That is not hypothetical.  At ``cb72667`` the ratchet was red in two places at
once and no CPU run could report either:

* four ``noahmp_*_gpu.py`` modules were committed with allocation sites and
  never entered below (``92216d0`` and earlier -- the triage note in
  ``docs/tree_triage_2026-07-26.md`` names them); and
* ``woof/core/ruc_gpu.py`` grew ``ruc_tanhf_glibc`` at ``dd0df4e``, a
  fourteenth site in a module recorded with thirteen -- which is the *count
  increase* this ratchet exists to catch, and which was invisible even to a
  GPU run, because the module-set assertion fired first and stopped the test
  before the counts were compared.

Both are fixed below: the file no longer needs a device, and the two
assertions now report together instead of one masking the other.

WHAT THE INVENTORY MEANS
------------------------
It is a debt register, not a waiver.  ``mynn_pbl_gpu``'s solver draws its
working set from ``MynnPblScratch`` and its row records only the DMP
sibling's four mixscalars buffers; everything else is
recorded at the count it has today and fails on any increase.  The distinction
that decides whether a recorded row is acceptable is the one YSU's entry
states: **an allocation the preflight knows about is a cost; an allocation it
does not is a hazard** -- and the property that separates MYNN's hazard from
every row below is whether the allocation scales with the nest.  For the
Noah-MP leaf batches that property is gated, not asserted, by
:func:`test_the_noahmp_leaf_batch_transients_are_bounded_by_the_column_batch`.

    The four modules are on the forecast's own path -- ``DEVICE_LEAF_BATCH``
    is what ``LEAF_BATCH_EVALUATOR`` resolves to unless
    ``WOOF_NOAHMP_HOST_LEAVES=1`` is set -- so "it is only a fixture" is not
    available as a defence, the way it is for ``noahmp_leaves_gpu`` and
    ``noahmp_fluxprep_gpu``, which nothing under ``gpuwm/`` imports.

    What IS available is that none of them can grow with the nest.  Two facts
    together give that, and both are checked here rather than believed:

    1. every allocation's shape is ``len(calls)`` times a fixed per-column
       stride, with no grid dimension anywhere in it; and
    2. ``noahmp_runtime.noahmp_lsm_step`` flushes its staging list at
       ``COLUMN_BATCH``, so ``len(calls)`` is bounded by that constant and not
       by ``nx*ny``.

    Both are read out of the source rather than imported.  ``noahmp_runtime``
    imports all eight leaf batches at module scope and several of those import
    cupy, so importing it here would put a device back into a file whose whole
    purpose is not to need one.

    At ``COLUMN_BATCH`` the four together are 620 B per staged column, or
    1.21 MiB.  MYNN's unpriced set, which is why any of this exists, was
    18,743.8 MiB at d04.  That is the whole difference between the two
    findings, and it is the reason the four rows above were entered rather
    than reported as a defect.

    The two ``*_slab.py`` packers are checked for the same shape property and
    are NOT covered by (2): nothing under ``gpuwm/`` imports them yet, so they
    are on no forecast path and inherit no bound.  Whatever eventually calls
    them has to carry one -- see the note beside their inventory rows for what
    an unbounded slab costs at d04.
