"""The single-layer UCM wired end to end through the physics driver.

The column, Noah and Noah-MP oracles prove the kernel against WRF; this
proves the wiring: ``sf_urban_physics = 1`` builds through
``initialize_physics``, the driver runs its surface step with the real
``woof.core.urban_ucm`` on the city columns, and nothing reaches a column
that is not a city.  Against the same driver at ``sf_urban_physics = 0``,
after three surface steps:

* every field on the non-urban columns is byte-identical (the UCM and its
  hand-over touch urban columns only, and every scheme between them is
  column-local);
* the city columns' skin temperature, fluxes and 2 m temperature moved;
* the urban state advanced from its cold start, and the surface-driver
  overrides published the UCM's own U10/V10/PSIM/PSIH/GZ1OZ0/AKMS and
  AKHS = CHS on the city columns, as module_surface_driver.F:3001-3021 does.
