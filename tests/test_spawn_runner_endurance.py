"""What the spawn runner costs over a 384-hour forecast.

Both defects here are invisible on a two-hour test and fatal on a long
one, which is why they need tests that COUNT rather than tests that
assert an outcome:

* the receipts file was re-serialised WHOLE on every leg boundary, so
  the bytes a run writes to it grow as the square of its length -- and
  the in-memory ledger it was serialising from grew without bound;
* the leg walk asked for a boundary every history interval for the whole
  run whenever any retired slot could still re-arm, so a 384 h run with
  a re-armable slot rebuilt its entire schedule ~4,600 times to discover
  ~4,600 times that a cooldown had not elapsed.

The instrument rule applies: each test measures the cost directly (bytes
written, entries retained, boundaries requested) rather than asserting
that a run "feels" cheaper, and each has a control that shows the meter
moves when the work is genuinely there.
