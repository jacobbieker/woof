"""Downward longwave has a source, or the run refuses to start.

THE DEFECT THIS FILE CLOSES.

``woof.core.physics.initialize_physics`` defaulted ``glw=300.0`` through
1.8.7, and ``woof/core/dudhia.py`` -- shortwave only -- returns
``glw=fields["glw"]``, the array it was handed, unchanged, on every
radiation call.  No production call site ever passed ``glw=``.  So every
run with ``ra_lw_physics = 0`` integrated a downward longwave of exactly
300.0 W m-2, everywhere, forever: a number with no relationship to
temperature, humidity or cloud, and one that looks entirely plausible in
a wrfout GLW row.

Radiative equilibrium at 300 W m-2 is 269.7 K.  A Gulf-coast October
night runs near 410 W m-2, or 291.6 K.  That ~105 W m-2 deficit is what
produced the shipped user report of 2 m dewpoints collapsing tens of
degrees below the airmass overnight.

WHAT WRF v4.6.1 DOES, read out of the source rather than remembered
(``phys/module_radiation_driver.F`` in the pinned reference bundle):

* ``radiation_driver`` returns at ``:1068`` only when BOTH streams are
  off, so ``ra_lw_physics = 0`` with ``ra_sw_physics > 0`` reaches
  ``lwrad_select`` at ``:1839``.  That select has cases for RRTM,
  Goddard, GFDL, CAM, RRTMG, RRTMG-fast, RRTMK, Held-Suarez and
  Fu-Liou-Gu -- and NO ``CASE (0)``.  It falls to ``CASE DEFAULT`` at
  ``:2245`` and calls ``wrf_error_fatal('The longwave option does not
  exist: lw_physics = 0')``.  Longwave-only is fatal too:
  ``swrad_select``'s ``CASE (0)`` at ``:2827`` calls ``wrf_error_fatal``
  for every ``lw_physics`` except Held-Suarez (``:2831-2835``), the one
  idealised case it excepts.
* With both streams off the driver returns early and ``GLW`` keeps its
  Registry-allocated 0.0 W m-2, which the land surface then consumes.

So woof refusing the shortwave-only pairing is WRF-conformant, and
woof's declared constant is a documented divergence from WRF's 0.0 in
the both-off case -- because zero downward longwave is not a physical
atmosphere either.

Every test here runs the real ``initialize_physics`` on a real card.
