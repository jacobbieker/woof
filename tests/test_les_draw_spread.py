"""The engine-side draw aggregator, pinned to the oracle's published one.

CPU-only.  ``woof/verify/draw_spread.py`` exists because the oracle's
``moist_spread.py`` cannot aggregate engine receipts -- it indexes
``wrfout_sha256`` unconditionally -- and patching the oracle's instrument
so it can also score the engine it exists to check is what
``INSTRUMENT-HISTORY.md`` forbids.

That leaves two independent reductions of the same statistic, which is
worse than one shared one unless they are pinned together.  These tests
pin them: the engine's aggregator is run over the ORACLE's own committed
multi-draw receipts, with the oracle's own metric and identity lists, and
must reproduce the oracle's published aggregate JSON exactly -- the
capped-moist reference family (n = 4 once the campaign completed) and
the n = 2 qv-12 fallback, both banked.

Nothing here cuts a band.  Neither aggregator can.
