"""Device acceptance gate for the Grell-Freitas shallow scheme kernel.

Same bar as tests/test_gf_shallow_parity.py: bitwise identity with the WRF
v4.6.1 per-case capture (gf-shallow-levels.csv / gf-shallow-surface.csv, 18
cases) with fzu PINNED from that capture, exactly as the CPU suite pins it.

WHY IT IS PINNED, AND WHAT CHANGED AT 2.7.0.  Through 2.6.5 gfk_tgamma was
WOOF's earlier gamma, which returned glibc 2.39's tgammaf words, so the
kernel and this gate could run the chain unpinned, the notch past the CPU
suite.  That gamma is replaced, and gfk_tgamma is now WOOF's own
CORRECTLY ROUNDED gamma,
which glibc's is not on 39.44 per cent of [0.25, 36].  The shallow arm is
the worst-exposed one: beta = 2.5 makes all three gamma calls live, and the
xkshal = (xaa0-aa1)/mbdt cancellation turns a last-bit fzu change into
8.4e-3 relative in the shallow mass flux.  So fzu is pinned here, the
divergence is recorded in docs/gf_gamma_known_delta.md, and gamma itself is
graded against a 113-bit oracle in
tests/test_gf_gamma_correctly_rounded.py.

OWNER RULING, and the ledger entry this file carries
----------------------------------------------------
WRF's k22 trigger (module_cu_gf_sh.F:373) is
``k22(i) = maxloc(HEO_CUP(i,2:kbmax(i)), 1)`` -- a MAXLOC over an array
SECTION whose result WRF uses as an absolute level index without adding
the section offset, leaving k22 one level BELOW the argmax wherever the
argmax sits above level 2.  The kernel's SHIPPED default is the CORRECTED
indexing (k22 IS the argmax); the WRF-faithful off-by-one lives behind the
``k22_wrf_faithful`` launch argument, which this parity suite sets to 1.

The measured delta between the two modes over the committed fixture
(test_the_corrected_k22_ledger_entry):

* k22_0 moves on exactly 3 of 18 cases -- case 6 (15 -> 16), case 13
  (8 -> 9, the witness the CPU suite pins), case 16 (9 -> 10);
* all three columns are REJECTED under both modes with identical ierr
  (3, 5, 3), so ZERO tendency words differ at the scheme boundary and
  zero words at the GFDRV boundary (tests/test_gf_gfdrv_cuda.py holds the
  driver half of the same claim);
* every converged column has its heo_cup argmax at level 2, where the two
  indexings coincide through the max(2, k22) floor.

So on this fixture the correction is diagnostically visible and
numerically free; the flag exists for the soundings where it would not be.
