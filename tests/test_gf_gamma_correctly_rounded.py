"""The gamma gate, after the earlier gamma was replaced.

WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.  Through ArWen 2.6.5 ``gfk_tgamma``
was WOOF's earlier gamma, which returned the same words as glibc 2.39's
``tgammaf``, and it was graded against
``woof/data/gf/oracle/gf-libm-tgammaf.csv``, a recording of what glibc
2.39 returns.  That gamma, like its replacement, was this project's own
work under the project's licence.  It carried glibc's rounding errors, and
at 2.6.6 it was replaced by a correctly rounded gamma; the earlier one is
gone.

The kernel now computes the CORRECTLY ROUNDED float32 gamma, so "matches one
binary" no longer describes the contract and grading against it would be
grading against a bug.  This file grades the contract that replaced it:
**the mathematically correct answer**, from a 113-bit oracle.  That is a
strictly stronger check -- any reviewer with any arbitrary-precision library
can regenerate the reference, whereas ``gf-libm-tgammaf.csv`` can only be
regenerated on x86-64 glibc 2.39.

It also PINS THE DIVERGENCE.  gfortran binds WRF's F2008 ``gamma()``
intrinsic to glibc's ``tgammaf``, so WOOF no longer reproduces WRF's ``fzu``
bit for bit.  ``docs/gf_gamma_known_delta.md`` is the record; the tests below
are what stop it drifting.

HOW A REVIEWER RUNS IT
----------------------
Everything except the two ``@pytest.mark.gpu`` tests runs with no GPU, no
CuPy and no compiler::

    pytest tests/test_gf_gamma_correctly_rounded.py -v

The host-compiled kernel arm builds its own copy of the harness when one
is not already built, so it needs a C++ toolchain but no manual step.  To
build the harness by hand anyway -- which is what the parity tool loads::

    cd tools/gf_wrf461_oracle && bash build.sh          # or, minimally:
    g++ -O2 -std=c++17 -ffp-contract=off -fno-unsafe-math-optimizations \
        -I ../../woof/core/kernels -shared -fPIC gf_host_harness.cpp \
        -o gf_host_harness.so -lm

To regenerate the reference fixtures from scratch (glibc-independent)::

    gcc -O2 -o /tmp/crg tools/gf_wrf461_oracle/gf_crgamma_dump.c -lm -lquadmath
    cut -d, -f1 woof/data/gf/oracle/gf-libm-tgammaf.csv | /tmp/crg /dev/stdin
