"""The capability gates, measured from outside.

``tests/conftest.py`` asks, once per session, whether the staged Rust
estate can do the thing the gated cases need, and skips those cases with
the command that stages it.  Two properties of that arrangement are not
visible from inside a normal run, and both were defects:

* a probe that RAISES takes collection down, and with it every test in
  the session that has nothing to do with the artifact.  ``WOOF_RW_NETCDF``
  naming a path that no longer exists does exactly that:
  ``woof.netcdf_bridge.find_netcdf_bin`` refuses a missing override on
  purpose, so a stale override collected nothing at all; and
* a gate written at function granularity skips the parametrizations that
  never open the artifact.  Three parametrized cases refuse their input in
  Python, before any bridge is reached, and those are the refusal tests --
  the class least worth switching off for want of a binary.

Both are measured here by running pytest in a subprocess, which is the
only way to see a collection-time verdict at all.

    Each of these functions parametrizes one refusal over several
    inputs.  Some are refused before the bridge's own operation is
    reached and pass against a staged estate too old for the rest; a
    function-level gate skipped those too, which is coverage lost to a
    binary the case never opens, and what it lost was refusal tests.
    Measured on the Linux CPU box with its ordinary staged estate: six
    such cases went from passing to skipped, and came back.

    The subprocess runs in THIS box's environment, unmodified, and the
    case recognises three estates:

    * the capability is PRESENT: the gate does not fire, there is no
      split to see, and the case skips itself;
    * the artifact is present but STALE: the gate fires, the unaffected
      refusal cases must run, and the artifact-opening control must be
      skipped by the gate.  This is the estate the gate exists for;
    * the artifact is ABSENT altogether (a fresh clone, or a wheel
      install that has not run ``tools/stage_wheel_bridges.py``): the
      file's own ``backend()``/``native()`` helper refuses the
      unaffected cases before the gate is the question, so the split is
      not observable and the case skips itself.

    The second and third are told apart by comparing the sibling's skip
    reason with the gate's own reason, which this process already holds
    as ``gap``: a skip that IS the gate's reason is the defect this case
    exists for, and a skip with any other reason is the file's helper.
    Guessing from the wording would not do: the helper's reason on the
    bare estate embeds the same staging command the gate's does, because
    both come from the bridge remedy text.
