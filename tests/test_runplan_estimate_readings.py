"""One plan, one card, one figure: the estimate document is the same
number on every reading and on every surface that prices it.

THE DEFECT.  ``woof run-plan --estimate`` quoted one resident plan
three different figures on one idle RTX 4090 -- 1,162,304,164,
1,163,352,740 and 1,166,498,468 bytes -- while the direct
``estimate_experiment`` call answered 1,353,931,428 every time.  Two
things were wrong, at two lines.

The readings moved because the device probe SAMPLED the card's bare
CUDA context as an NVML ``memory.used`` delta either side of its own
context, a card-wide figure in whole MiB: one probe printed 395 MiB
with every other field of the probe identical across readings, and two
earlier receipts of the same plan sit exactly 3 and 4 MiB below it.
That reading went into ``non_pool_device_bytes`` and from there into
``peak_envelope_bytes``, so the document was a sample.  The context is
now priced from the card's shader census, which is what the run door's
own ``Machine`` has always priced.

The fence disagreed because the document prices the card in the
machine and the direct call it was compared with priced the reference
card: the two were about different devices.  The document now states
every device term it priced on (``device_profile``,
``device_total_bytes``) and the cadence, and the fence prices the
direct call on exactly those.

A THIRD SURFACE, found by the same fence: ``woof check`` on a machine
whose card answers the probe but whose kernels do not compile (a CuPy
wheel without CUDA headers) took its CPU-only route and priced the
reference card, so one file on one RTX 4090 read 1,353,931,428 bytes
from ``woof check --json`` and 1,205,295,780 from ``run-plan
--estimate``.  That route now reads the card through the same probe
and prices its census, saying beside the figure that the kernels were
not compiled here; a machine with no readable card keeps the reference
figure and says so.

CPU-only.  The probe is pinned at its subprocess seam or run in a bare
interpreter against a shadow ``cupy``; no test here touches a card.
