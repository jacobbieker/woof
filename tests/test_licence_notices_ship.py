"""The licence layer, pinned the way every other claim in this repository is.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS
--------------------------
The 2.7.0 licence lane found two present breaches of PERMISSIVE licences --
NumPy's BSD-3-Clause and MPAS's -- in a tree that already carried a careful
NOTICE, a licenses/ directory and a 670 KB binary-form notice.  Neither was
found by the licence census, because the census sorted third-party code into
"vendored crate" and "pip dependency" and both of these are neither: they are
FIRST-PARTY CRATES THAT PORT THIRD-PARTY CODE INTO THEMSELVES.
``static-fields`` ports four NumPy SIMD kernels; ``rw-mpas`` is 44,768 lines
of MPAS-Atmosphere v8.4.1.  Both ship compiled, in the release bundles and in
platform wheels, and until 2.7.0 neither appeared in any notice.

Nothing checked any of it.  Before this file, ``grep -rIln 'licenses/' tests/``
returned one unrelated hit: no test asserted that ``licenses/*`` exists, that
it reaches a wheel, that the nineteen per-file notice headers survive an edit,
that the kernel notice's file lists still match the tree, or that the
binary-form notice's two copies still agree.  In a project whose discipline is
"pin it or it drifts", the licence layer was the one thing unpinned.

WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS
----------------------
1.  Every text in ``licenses/`` is non-empty and is NAMED in the root NOTICE,
    and every ``licenses/...`` path the NOTICE names exists.  A text nothing
    points at, and a pointer at nothing, are both failures.
2.  Both distributions declare ``licenses/*`` in ``license-files``, and the
    kernel-directory notice is named in package-data.  This is the only route
    by which a ``pip install`` user receives any of it.
3.  The binary-form notice's two copies are byte-identical and the bundle copy
    sits under a directory ``build_bridge_bundle`` actually walks.
4.  The nineteen files that carry a per-file notice still carry it.
5.  The Arm scope list in ``woof/core/kernels/LICENSE-third-party.txt`` is
    DERIVED FROM THE TREE, not typed: the sixteen files are exactly the ones
    that reproduce Arm's coefficient tables.  The FDLIBM list is pinned, and a
    kernel that starts defining an FDLIBM routine without joining it fails.
6.  Every first-party crate carrying a third-party licence marker, and every
    upstream Fortran project a first-party crate cites, is named in the NOTICE.
    This is the check that would have caught NumPy and MPAS.
7.  The earlier Grell-Freitas gamma replaced at 2.7.0 stays deleted, and so
    do the two glibc-only libm fragments removed at the same release.
8.  No shipped licence text, kernel header or document describes the
    Grell-Freitas gamma in ``glibc_flt32.cuh`` as a transcription, as LGPL,
    as FSF copyright or as glibc's work.  Both gammas, the earlier one and
    the current one, are this project's own work (ruling of 2026-09-12); an
    earlier development record said otherwise and was wrong, and the claim
    came back into the tree three times from that record before this pin.
9.  The two generated notices survive their own generators.  The terminal
    section's generator, which every version bump runs, replaces that
    section and nothing after it; and the Zarr reader's notice reproduces
    the binary notice as it is now, resolved from the lock as it is now.

It reads text.  No CUDA, no compiler, no network, no device.
