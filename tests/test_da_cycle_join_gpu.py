"""A cycling leg boundary is a restart: measured, array for array.

The DA driver rebuilds every trajectory's model at every leg and joins
one leg to the next.  The join used to be a host copy of the serialised
atmosphere and a clock placed by arithmetic, which carried nothing the
physics driver owns -- soil, surface, precipitation accumulators, held
tendencies, the radiation carriers -- so all of it restarted from the
prepared background at every analysis.  The join is now the restart
owner's own checkpoint set.

These cells hold that as a measurement on the card, on the same
hand-built tree the driver assembles (the synthetic parent and nest of
``tests/test_da_nested_forecast_gpu.py``): the checkpoint a continuous
run writes at its end has to equal, member for member and byte for
byte, the checkpoint a run split into two legs and joined through the
owner writes at the same instant.  The retired join is kept beside it
as the red arm, so the comparison cannot pass by comparing nothing.
