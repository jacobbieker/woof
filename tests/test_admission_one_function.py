"""One admission per run, on every route, and the advisories around it.

Each test here pins a place where two surfaces answered one question
twice.  The headline is ``woof run``'s tree route: it was the last door
that priced its ``[tiles]`` admission from the run's own memory ledger,
at build time, after the whole case had been fetched -- while
``woof check`` priced the same tree from
:func:`woof.core.preflight.admission_estimate` before anything was
spent.  MEASURED on the 12/3 km moving-nest cyclone tree, the two
estimates differ by hundreds of megabytes, so there is a band of budgets
in which the review admitted the tree and the run then refused it.

The rest are the advisories the 2.7.3 reviews recorded against the same
seam: a catalog spawned once per plan review, a machine built twice, a
moving subtree the build pass stopped knowing about, a budget the cyclone
door quoted unwithheld, and a dead render's working stores.
