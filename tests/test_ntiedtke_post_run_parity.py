"""``cu_ntiedtke_post_run`` graded at ``max_ulp == 0`` -- the eight fields.

THE FIELDS PHASE 1 IS GRADED ON. ``nt-levels.csv`` carries eight tendency
columns -- ``rthcuten rqvcuten rqccuten rqicuten rucuten rvcuten raincv
pratec`` -- and until this slice existed every one of them traced to
NOTHING in the tree: ``cu_ntiedtke_run`` produces ``pt``/``pqv``/``pqc``/
``pqi``/``pu``/``pv`` and ``zprecc``, and no component turned those into
what the model consumes. The gap was visible in the oracle's own header the
whole time and was found by a gate driven off that header
(``test_ntiedtke_output_provenance.py``), not by anyone reading the list.

TWO VERTICAL CONVENTIONS IN ONE STATEMENT, and this is the only slice in
the port where that is true. ``exner/qv/qc/qi/t/u/v`` are the driver's
untouched WRF-order inputs -- k = 1 the SURFACE -- and they are the
reference state the tendency is measured against. ``tf/qvf/qcf/qif/uf/vf``
carry ``cu_ntiedtke_run``'s answer in SCHEME order, k = 1 the model TOP.
The routine pairs them by flipping.

The fixture records each array at its OWN index rather than pre-pairing
them, so the flip stays the port's job -- exactly as it is the routine's
job. Pairing them in the fixture would hide a flip error in the one capture
built to expose it, and ``test_the_flip_is_load_bearing`` below is what
turns that from an argument into a measurement.
