"""`--series` needs the native engine, and the door that builds it says so.

`--series` renders a whole timeline into ONE renderer store so multi-hour
windowed products can be differenced across frames (`qpf_6h` is F012 minus
F006).  The matplotlib arm has none of that machinery: it renders one file at
a time out of a catalog of five per-file instantaneous products, so
``woof/render.py`` refuses the pair at argument resolution.  Nothing a reader
meets first said why.

The Plot history guide is this lane's door onto that command.  It builds
``render ... --series --engine rust`` (``tools/arwen-tui/src/guide.rs``, the
``Kind::Render`` arm of :func:`Guide::request`), and the command it builds is
shown for review and copying before anything runs, so the engine requirement
belongs in the help beside it.

A declaration only counts where the reader can actually read it.  The guide's
help pane does not scroll (``main.rs`` renders it as a plain wrapped
``Paragraph`` with no scroll offset, unlike the help dialog), and the
workspace refuses to draw below 65 x 20, so anything that wraps past the
bottom of that pane is unreachable: no key pages to it and no resize is
offered.  :func:`test_the_plot_history_help_reaches_the_reader_at_65_by_20`
measures the help against that pane.  Its Rust twin,
``guide::tests::the_plot_history_help_reaches_the_reader_at_the_smallest_supported_terminal``,
renders the real dialog through ratatui at 65 x 20 and reads the screen back;
this one repeats the measurement in the portable suite so a wording edit is
caught without a Rust toolchain.

The mechanism behind the requirement does not fit that pane in six rows, so
it is recorded in ``CHANGELOG.md`` instead of in the help, and
:func:`test_the_changelog_keeps_the_mechanism_the_pane_cannot_hold` holds it
there: shortening the help is only safe while the tree still says somewhere
why the native engine is the one that can draw a timeline.

Asserted here on the guide and this repository's changelog alone, because
they are the only sites in reach.  The refusal text at woof/render.py:2338
still names the mechanism and neither the breakage nor the way out, and the
`--series` argparse help at woof/render.py:2530-2531 still names no engine;
that file belongs to the lane editing it and is out of bounds here, so both
are handed back untouched.  docs/public/CLI-OPTIONS.md:1114 is generated from
that argparse help by `python -m tools.build_cli_options_doc` and is never
hand-edited, so it follows render.py:2531 and nothing is to be done there by
hand.  docs/public/CLI-USER-MANUAL.md:463, :476, :483 and its render option
table at :488-498, and docs/public/TUI-USER-MANUAL.md:258, still describe
`--series` with no engine named and are outside this lane's paths; they are
handed back with those line numbers.  No case here asserts on any of them: a
test this lane cannot turn green does not belong in this lane.
