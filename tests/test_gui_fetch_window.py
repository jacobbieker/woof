"""New forecast's source check asks about the download the run makes, and one source's answer is only its row.

Picking the offered 3 h length turned the whole source list into a 500.  For AIFS, AIGFS and AIGEFS, whose files
come every 6 hours, the row's check asked the fetch's lead resolver about a 3-hour window, which it refuses, inside
the request, and one row's exception failed every row, GFS included; the fit for the same draft answered 500 too.
No run asks for that window: `woof domain` writes the download rounded up to whole 6-hour steps, hours 0 and 6
(woof.domain_wizard.fetch_window).  The check now asks about that same download.
