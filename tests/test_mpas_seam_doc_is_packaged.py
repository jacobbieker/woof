"""``docs/mpas-seam.md`` ships, because an external engine pins it.

The state this file closes, measured against the published 2.5.x wheels:
woof hex verifies the physics seam it builds against by hashing sixteen
engine files by SHA-256, keyed on their REPOSITORY paths, and it runs
that one key set against two roots -- a woof source checkout, and
``site-packages`` (the directory ``importlib.util.find_spec("woof")``'s
origin sits two levels under).  Fifteen of the sixteen resolve under
both, because they live inside the ``woof`` package and a wheel carries
that package whole.  ``docs/mpas-seam.md`` -- the document that STATES
the seam contract those fifteen implement -- resolved under the checkout
only, because no distribution placed it anywhere at all.  Its verifier
reported it ``absent`` on every installed engine, and the remedy it
printed told the reader to clone the repository beside the wheel they
had just installed.

Where the file lands is the whole point and is not incidental.  A
consumer running one manifest against two roots needs the SAME key to
resolve under both, so the installed copy has to sit at
``<site-packages>/docs/mpas-seam.md``.  ``woof/docs/mpas-seam.md``
would work only for a consumer willing to carry a second key for one
document, which is how a pin quietly grows a special case.  That is the
same reasoning ``configs`` shipped under
(``tests/test_configs_are_packaged.py``), and this file measures the
agreement rather than leaving it to a coincidence of two declarations.

The measurement asks setuptools' own ``build_py`` what the declaration
selects, exactly as the configs gate does, so what it reports is what a
wheel would really contain.  The wheel-level test opens a built wheel.
