"""``woof doctor`` + the shared bridge-resolution mechanism.

The wheel ships no compiled Rust, so a wheel user's estate is: cupy?
render extra? bridges built and findable? tables packaged? data roots
set?  Doctor must name each gap WITH its exact remedy, and ingest's
bridge resolution must honor the same env-var/default-dir mechanism
doctor describes.  Everything here is CPU-only and read-only.
