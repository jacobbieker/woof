"""Certified Noah profiles must remain byte-identical to their capture.

RE-PINNED 2026-09-17 (lane/2.7.6-pin-gates) ON ONE CARD.  The fixture was
captured on 2026-07-30 (d63e2e2fc) against the certified v1.1.2 commit as
one change's before/after harness and nothing ran it before a cut; on
a development machine's RTX 4090 (compute capability 8.9, driver 610.57.04) at fc639c51f
its reading is: field_inventory_sha256 MOVED for all four profiles
(77a004176d274621b918e5f083b67a4c1a819d9cba605797d4b419ef099ae9a9 to
217f1bd3fadfab1669ee802cdbe4bd4202bf329014b971e2ccfc16ccf4db568b: the
state the harness hashes gained fields since July), and sha256 MOVED for
all four (wsm6_dudhia f4fafb37 to 590e09e8, thompson_dudhia to e7a7d684,
morrison_rte to 5ce45b7d, nssl2_rte to 1a6e4d09).  The trajectories step
the dycore, and every stepped run's bits moved by construction at the EOS
spelling 6b11e4c99 (2026-09-03, readings in its message) and again at the
Omega column kernel fc639c51f (readings under tests/data/receipts/
omega-column-scan/), and the phase-2 step pin shows the same builders give
different bits on an RTX 5070 Ti and an RTX 4090 (25 of 27 entries,
tests/data/receipts/pin-gates/), so a whole-trajectory digest is a property
of the card as well.  The fixture therefore records the card it describes,
this test skips with the reason on any other card, and a digest that moves
on the recorded card means a change to one of these four compositions
shipped without a reading: the fixer records one and re-pins by running
tools/certified_surface_identity.py on that card.
