"""A cross-scheme microphysics nest edge off a STREAMED parent, on the CPU.

This lived behind a refusal: ``_coupled_parent_field`` raised rather than
run, on the argument that ``launch_microphysics_edge_field`` reads
parent species the coupler could not enumerate and would therefore map the
parent's air AT ATTACH TIME into the edge.  The species list was never
missing -- ``microphysics_transition`` already declares it as the kernel's
own input set -- so the fix is the windowed pull the non-transition arm two
lines below already does, over that list instead of over one field plus
``mup``.  These are the CPU contracts for it.

Why not ``tests/test_nest_coupler.py``: that module is uncollectable
without cupy on a CPU box (its ``from woof.core.dycore import
_boundary_forced`` pulls ``woof/core/dycore.py``, which imports cupy at
module scope), so a test placed there would never run in the CPU gate.
``woof.core.nest``, ``woof.core.microphysics_transition`` and
``woof.core.streaming`` all import cleanly without it.
