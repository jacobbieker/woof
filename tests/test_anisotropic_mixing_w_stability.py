# tests/test_anisotropic_mixing_w_stability.py
"""Measured: per-axis mixing lengths can amplify the 2dx mode in w.

WRF hands ``horizontal_diffusion_w_2`` the VERTICAL exchange coefficient
(``dyn_em/module_diffusion_em.F:3003``, dummy spelled ``xkmv`` at
``:3524``), and with ``mix_isotropic = 0`` ``smag_km`` both builds AND
caps that coefficient on the vertical length scale (``:1890-1900``)::

    xkmv = min( c_s^2 * dz^2 * |S| ,  mix_upper_bound * dz^2 / dt )

The operator that consumes it then differences over the HORIZONTAL
spacing.  Nothing in the chain compares the coefficient against that
spacing, so the largest ratio the operator can be handed is
``mix_upper_bound * (dz_max/dx)^2`` -- independent of ``dt``, because the
cap carries ``1/dt`` and the ratio carries ``dt``.  An explicit Laplacian
multiplies a 2-grid-interval mode by ``1 - 4*K*dt/dx^2`` per step, so
past 1/4 the sign flips and past 1/2 the mode grows: the diffusion
amplifies exactly the structure it exists to remove.

This file MEASURES that, rather than modelling it.  Seed a 2dx/2dy
checkerboard in ``w``, run the model's own once-per-step held-tendency
builder, apply the increment the dycore would apply over one ``dt``, and
read the checkerboard's amplification straight off the result.  The pin
is that the isotropic-length configuration never amplifies; the control
is that the per-axis one does, at the same grid, so the instrument is
known to be able to fail.

The closed form of the same statement, and the load-time advisory built
on it, are in ``tests/test_anisotropic_mixing_advisory.py`` -- separately,
because those are CPU and this is not.

Generic throughout: the criterion is grid geometry, not a case.
