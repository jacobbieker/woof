"""WP-11a: the front door for ``mp_physics=28`` (Thompson aerosol-aware).

Before this package landed, eight validated CUDA translation units and a
complete adapter existed and NO USER COULD REACH ANY OF THEM.  Three
independent gates refused the selector:

* ``woof/config.py`` -- ``mp_physics not in (0, 1, 6, 8, 10, 18)`` raised;
* ``woof/core/microphysics.py`` -- ``apply`` refused, and ``_dispatch_scheme``
  fell through to the NSSL arm, so even a widened ``apply`` would have run
  the wrong scheme;
* ``woof/core/refl.py`` -- ``compute_refl_10cm`` raised, so the one
  user-facing product field the fixtures reach 52 dBZ on was unreachable.

Two configuration fields the scope pin talks about did not exist at all:
``RunConfig`` had no ``aer_init_opt`` and no ``wif_input_opt``, so there was
nothing a user could set and, more importantly, nothing that could REFUSE.
A scope pin that cannot be violated is not a scope pin.

Every test below fails on the pre-WP-11a tree.  The mechanism of each
failure is stated in its docstring, because "this test is new" and "this
test caught something" are different claims.

WHAT THIS MODULE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT TEST
-------------------------------------------
The mp=28 numerics.  ``tests/test_thompson_aerosol_adapter.py`` owns the G3
oracle gate against all 19 WRF column fixtures and publishes its residuals;
duplicating a weaker version of that here would only create a second, laxer
authority.  What this module tests is that the scheme is REACHABLE, that it
is reachable only in configurations WOOF can actually honour, and that the
one thing it must never do -- change a field mp=28 does not own -- it does
not do.

#: reflectivity that is a smooth function of the rain moments and of
#: nothing else.  So this is not a reflectivity defect: it is the rain
#: residual WP-09 declared, expressed in dB.  The gate is stated separately
#: instead of raising the global one, so a regression anywhere else stays
#: caught at 2.0e-04.
#:
#: RETIRED BY WP-13a, AND KEPT AS AN EMPTY DICT ON PURPOSE.  Restoring WRF's
#: level-wise :3237-vs-:3568 sedimentation density took aero-reduces-to-

#: 7.736e-03 this carve-out was sized for) to 3.242e-05 dB, so EVERY fixture
#: in the deck now clears the flat 2.0e-04 dB gate and the exemption buys

    ``refl_dbz`` column WRF's own ``calc_refl10cm`` wrote into each fixture,

    1. THE CLAMP IS BITWISE.  Every level where WRF reports its -35 dBZ
       floor (``refl_10cm(i,k,j) = MAX(-35., dBZ(k))``,
       module_mp_thompson.F:1461) must be exactly -35.0 here -- RE-MEASURED

       it.)  A port that computed dBZ correctly but clamped at, say,
       -35.0000001 would pass a tolerance test and fail this one.
    2. THE SIGNAL AGREES.  The 102 levels with real returns must agree to
       :data:`_REFL_DBZ_GATE`.  ``_REFL_DBZ_INHERITED_GATE`` is now EMPTY --
       WP-13a closed the one fixture that needed it -- so this is the flat
       gate on every fixture, with no exception at all.
    3. THE COMPARISON IS NOT VACUOUS.  The fixtures must actually contain

def test_the_reflectivity_residual_is_the_declared_rain_residual_in_db():
    """Attribution, DERIVED from WRF's own moment algebra, not a pinned level.

    ``aero-reduces-to-classic`` USED TO BE the one fixture whose dBZ column
    missed the 2.0e-04 dB gate (see "WHAT WP-13a CHANGED" below -- it now
    clears it with a 6x margin), and the claim this test owns is that its
    residual, then and now, is the DECLARED rain-moment residual seen through
    ``calc_refl10cm`` -- not an independent reflectivity defect wearing an
    "inherited" label.

    THE DERIVATION (module_mp_thompson.F, all in ``calc_refl10cm``):

        :5915   ze_rain = N0_r * crg(4) * ilamr**cre(4)
        :5770   N0_r    = nr * org2 * lamr**cre(2)
        :5768   lamr    = (am_r*crg(3)*org2*nr/rr)**obmr,  obmr = 1/bm_r (:721)

    with ``mu_r = 0`` (:103), so ``cre(2) = mu_r + 1 = 1`` and
    ``cre(4) = bm_r*2 + mu_r + 1 = 7`` (:706, :708) and ``bm_r = 3``.
    Substituting:

        ze_rain  =  const * nr * lamr**(1 - 7)
                 =  const * nr * (nr/rr)**(-2)
                 =  const * rr**2 / nr                     EXACTLY

    so to first order the reflectivity-factor error is
    ``eps_Z = 2*eps_rr - eps_nr`` and the dB residual is
    ``10*log10(1 + 2*eps_qr - eps_nr)``, SIGNED.  Rain is the only
    contributor here: ``qs`` and ``qg`` are bitwise equal to WRF at every
    level of this column, so ``ze_snow`` and ``ze_graupel`` (:5980) cancel out
    of the difference exactly.

    WHAT WP-13a CHANGED, AND WHY THE ASSERTIONS INVERT.  This fixture no
    longer misses the 2.0e-04 dB gate at all.  Restoring WRF's level-wise
    :3237-vs-:3568 sedimentation density took the worst |dBZ - WRF| on this
    column from 5.283e-04 dB to 3.242e-05 dB -- a 16x margin INSIDE the flat
    gate -- which is why ``_REFL_DB_BOUNDS`` in
    tests/test_thompson_aerosol_adapter.py and
    :data:`_REFL_DBZ_INHERITED_GATE` in this file were both retired.  So the
    old assertions "the worst level's rain residual is above the G3 gate" and
    "2.0e-04 dB < worst < 1.0e-03 dB" are now FALSE and are replaced by their
    closure counterparts rather than relaxed.

    AND THE MECHANISM CLAIM HAD TO CHANGE UNITS WITH IT.  At 5e-04 dB the
    linearisation above was tested as a RATIO to 5%.  At 3e-05 dB it cannot
    be: the residual is now within a few float32 ulps of the dBZ value itself
    (1.9e-06 dB near -25 dBZ), and the old docstring's claim that ze_snow and
    ze_graupel "cancel out of the difference exactly" because qs and qg are
    bitwise equal is only true to first order -- calc_refl10cm also reads the
    temperature, and temp_k on this column differs by 1.393e-07 relative.  So
    the claim asserted below is the one that survives at this magnitude and is
    still falsifiable: at EVERY non-floor level the measured dB residual
    exceeds the rain-moment prediction by no more than 2.0e-05 dB, i.e. no
    level carries an independent reflectivity error bigger than a tenth of the
    gate.  A genuine reflectivity defect would break it; float32 dBZ rounding
    cannot.

    RE-MEASURED after the 1.4.1 merge (RTX 5090, cupy 14.1.1), predicted vs
    measured dB.  Every number below MOVED TOWARDS ZERO; the previous
    measurement is in parentheses where it differs materially:

        0-based level 0   -1.448e-07  vs  +5.722e-06
        0-based level 1   +0.000e+00  vs  +6.676e-06
        0-based level 2   -1.371e-06  vs  +6.676e-06
        0-based level 3   -2.965e-07  vs  +8.583e-06
        0-based level 4   -4.559e-07  vs  +6.914e-06
        0-based level 5   +1.801e-06  vs  +9.537e-06   <- worst
                          (was +2.631e-05  vs  +3.242e-05)

    So the worst |dBZ - WRF| on this column is now 9.537e-06 dB, a 21x
    margin inside the flat 2.0e-04 dB gate, and the rain-moment prediction
    is below the float32 dBZ ulp at EVERY non-floor level.  Assertion 4
    below records that as a closure.

    #    this column's biggest rain residual by far (3.155e-03) and WRF puts

    #    the dB carve-out did.  It used to read "the prediction is above the
    #    dBZ ulp at exactly one level, and that level is ALSO the worst
    #    level".  The 1.4.1 merge inherited the mp=8 lane's two sedimentation
    #    reconciliations (5e4af4e3, cb765336) into the frozen kernel this
    #    port shares for rain fallout, level 5's nr residual went 5.700e-06
    #    -> 4.146e-07, and the rain-moment prediction with it: 2.631e-05 dB
    #    -> 1.801e-06 dB.  There is now NO non-floor level where the
    #    prediction is resolvable against float32 dBZ at all.
    #
    #    That is a closure, not a loss of evidence, and it is asserted as
    #    one: the attribution above (assertion 2 -- the worst dB level is the
    #    worst rain-residual level) still holds and is still falsifiable, and
    #    a regression that re-grows the rain residual makes the prediction
    #    resolvable again and fails HERE.
