"""The spectral score door reads its gridded planes in Rust, not netCDF4.

``woof spectral score`` / ``run`` opens a forecast history file and pulls a
whole gridded plane out of it -- a decode, on the bare default of a shipped
door.  Until the 2026-08-18 boundary audit (finding F2) it did that with
``netCDF4.Dataset``, which is the C library, while every other field read in
the estate had already moved to ``rw_netcdf``.

These tests pin the flip, in :mod:`woof.downscale`'s shape: FIELD values come
through :mod:`woof.netcdf_bridge`, and the door never reaches a Python NetCDF
library to get them.  The concrete breakage they prevent: two decoders reading
the same wrfout, so a spectral receipt could disagree with the renderer and the
verifier about what the model actually wrote, with nothing in the receipt
saying which library produced the numbers.
