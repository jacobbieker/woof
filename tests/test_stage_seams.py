"""The pipeline's three stages, each reachable and each usable alone.

A collaborator running WOOF inside his own pipeline reported the defect
this file is the gate for: he wants to pull his own data, author his own
namelist, run OUR preprocessing on HIS inputs, then run OUR simulation
alone with nothing fetching and nothing plotting.  ``woof go`` welded
those stages shut -- the capability was all present, but the only
supported way in was the whole chain.

So these are DOOR tests, in the project's sense: a headline feature owns
a permanent test that the front door exists, that a worked example
reaches it, and that the seam is a real boundary rather than a private
call.  Four properties:

1. **Reachability.**  ``woof prep`` and ``woof sim`` are on the real
   command surface, take ``--help``, and dispatch.
2. **One implementation, two spellings.**  ``woof prep`` adopts
   :mod:`woof.source_cli`'s parser rather than restating it, so the
   subcommand and the standalone ``rw-wps`` script cannot drift.
3. **The seam is a boundary.**  ``woof sim --print-command`` emits the
   exact runner line a third party can run themselves, composed from
   digests read off the bundle's own artifacts.
4. **``go`` is a composition, not a second route.**  The command ``go``
   composes for its forecast stage is byte-identical to the one ``woof
   sim`` composes for the same prepared tree -- on the single-domain arm
   AND the tree arm.  If those ever diverge, ``go`` has stopped being an
   orchestration of the stages and become a parallel implementation,
   which is the exact failure the unbundling was for.

And one negative property that is the user's own words made
machine-checkable: running the simulation stage must not import the
fetch machinery.  "no data pulling" is not a promise in prose here, it
is an assertion about ``sys.modules`` in a fresh interpreter.

    The stage reaching dispatch without :mod:`woof.fetch` in

    that module is the forcing-data download machinery, and the
    simulation stage must not be able to reach it even by accident.
    ``woof go``'s relay helper imports it for its ``sha256_file``,
    which is exactly why this seam carries its own digest helper
    instead of borrowing that one.

    ``urllib.request`` is deliberately NOT asserted absent, and the
    accuracy matters: :mod:`woof.table_assets`, which the single-domain
    runner imports for its Thompson-table check, imports it at module
    scope.  That is a pre-existing property of the runner, it predates
    this seam, and claiming otherwise here would be a test that passes
    by describing something else.  What the network claim rests on is
    the behavioural test below.

    The probe drives :mod:`woof.stage_cli` rather than
    :mod:`woof.cli`, because the aggregate CLI imports every
    subcommand's registrar at module scope and so pulls the download
    stack in for ``woof version`` too.  That is the aggregator's
    property, not this stage's; the stage is the unit a third party
