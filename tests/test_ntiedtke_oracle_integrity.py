"""The shipped New Tiedtke oracle must match its own recorded digests.

``tools/ntiedtke_wrf461_oracle/build.sh`` WRITES ``oracle-sha256sums.txt``
but does not check it -- it cannot, because the CSVs are that build's
outputs and pinning an output against itself is circular.  The real byte
pin is on the WRF SOURCE, and build.sh does verify that (three files, by
sha256, refusing to run otherwise).

What was missing is an integrity check on the SHIPPED artefact.  The CSVs
travel from the build directory into ``woof/data/ntiedtke/oracle/`` by
hand, and that copy is exactly where a fixture regeneration can go half
done -- MEASURED once already: after a case-table retune, 7 of 12 recorded
digests did not match the files beside them, because the copy took
``nt-*.csv`` and left the digest file behind.  Every parity test in the
suite would still have passed, because they grade the mirror and the
kernel against whatever CSVs are present.

So this is the gate that notices.  It is CPU-only and reads nothing but
the data directory.
