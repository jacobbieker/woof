"""What the landmask/soil-category reconciler is allowed to read.

``dyn_em/module_initialize_real.F:3608-3650`` decides a column whose land
mask disagrees with its soil category from its soil temperature, then its
SST, and aborts on ``mismatch_landmask_ivgtyp`` with neither.  woof
transcribes all three arms (tests/test_ruc_shoreline_soil_category.py); what
this file covers is the step BEFORE them -- finding the evidence in a met
field mapping whose spellings differ per source.

A land column whose soil map says water never needs that evidence: real.exe
matches it to silty clay loam first (``:3108-3131``), keeping its land-use
category, and so does the rulebook.  The evidence tests below therefore
drive the final pass directly, on a column the match has not settled.

That lookup has failed twice, and both times the soil column was present in
the mapping the reconciler was handed:

* 2026-08-06, native HRRR: the chain did not know ``SOILT`` and a nested
  1 km preparation aborted on 38 shoreline columns;
* 2026-08-08, nested GFS: the chain did not know ``GFS_ST000010`` and a
  3 km child aborted on 73 inland-water columns, which made nested-GFS
  preparation impossible for essentially any CONUS child holding a
  reservoir or a river.

Both fixes were a name added to an inline chain at one call site.  These
tests hold the replacement -- ONE table in ``woof/ingest/soil.py``, read by
every call site -- and, just as hard, hold the final pass's refusal: a column
that reaches it with no evidence must still abort, because the third arm is
correct and fail-open there would fabricate a soil column.
