"""The per-source physics menu, and the refusals that read it.

The design ruling, 2026-08-20: "why cant every model have multiple unique
working default".  Every registered source gets its OWN default and its
own set of suites that actually run on it, and both are COMPUTED from
the admissibility rules that already refuse -- never a hand-kept table
one repo to the left.

The failure this closes was met while driving the GUI: a suite that runs
shortwave with longwave off met a night window, the refusal's remedy
named a Kain-Fritsch suite, and the HRRR route then refused that suite
for ``cu_physics = 1`` because a 3 km grid resolves its own convection.
A remedy that leads to the next refusal names nothing.
