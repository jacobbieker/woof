"""A point request is sized to a domain, not to whatever the card holds.

``--point`` carries a centre and no extent, so the fit has to choose one.
Until 2.7.3 the only thing that chose was memory: the scale bisection grew
the root until the envelope met the budget.  That produced two failures at
once on the door the desktop's forecast request uses.

* With streaming on -- ``--tiles auto``, the desktop's default -- memory
  never binds, because the card holds one tile and not the domain.  A
  card with about 7 GiB free sized a 12 km root of 2326 x 1860 mass
  points: 27,912 x 22,320 km, wider than the Earth's circumference at
  mid-latitudes, wrapped around the projection pole.  A mid-latitude
  point was then REFUSED at plan review for reaching a pole, which the
  reader was told to fix by drawing a smaller area -- advice that does
  not apply to a request that drew nothing.
* Resident fits reached the same place more slowly: a 180 GiB budget
  sized 26,952 km on the same ladder.

The fit now carries two bounds of its own, both properties of the REQUEST
rather than of the card, and both of which SHRINK the domain instead of
refusing it: a maximum extent (:data:`POINT_FIT_MAX_EXTENT_KM`), and the
projection's own polar envelope.

What stays a refusal is the case a smaller domain cannot fix: an area the
user DREW that reaches the pole, and a point so close to one that even the
minimum layout contains it.  Those two keep their wording, which the
desktop maps to its own sentence.

And the cap is a QUIET default.  Its first version announced itself with a
``warning:`` on stderr, which is a claim that something unusual happened --
but a mid-latitude point on any card from about 16 GiB up is the ordinary
request, so the warning fired on essentially every one of them and turned
``tests/test_go_chain.py`` red on the door's own default emission.  The
bound is now stated once, as a plain fact, in the plan summary on stdout
(:func:`woof.domain_wizard.point_fit_cap_note`), where the reader is
already being told what was sized.  stderr is left for the requests that
really are unusual: the two refusals above.
