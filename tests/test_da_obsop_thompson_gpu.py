"""GPU gate: the Thompson (mp_physics=8) reflectivity route of H_Z(x).

Deliberately its own file, and gpu-marked, structured exactly like the
NSSL gate (``test_da_obsop_nssl_gpu.py``): ``woof.da.obsop``'s CPU test
module imports no CuPy on purpose, and classic Thompson has no float64
column mirror -- the host path names a refusal (tested in
``test_da_obsop.py``), so the ONLY executable H_Z(x) on ``mp_physics=8``
is the CUDA route.  Until this file existed, that route's warrant was
"it is the same ``core.refl`` call the product makes" -- true by
construction, receipted nowhere.  What this file pins:

- the device path genuinely dispatches ``mp_physics=8`` to the product's
  own Thompson ``calc_refl10cm`` port, bit-for-bit against a direct
  ``launch_refl10cm_thompson`` on the same state -- the operator is the
  product authority, not a lookalike;
- the -35 dBZ clear-air floor of the 1/6/8/10 family (NSSL's is 0);
- the classic graupel-number shadow, on both sides of the line it sits
  on.  That shadow is a REBUILT scratch slot (``woof/io/restart.py``:
  per-call work buffer, never serialized, finalized and consumed by
  REFL_10CM), so a DA caller evaluating H_Z between steps cannot read it
  off a checkpoint.  It does not have to: the wrapper DIAGNOSES the
  moment from qg, T, p and qv at the entry of every call, and between
  steps that diagnosis IS the moment, so the operator derives it.  The
  product-side authority still refuses without it, because its caller
  is inside the microphysics call and does hold the evolved one.  This
  file pins both, because a fix that demoted the refusal instead of
  deriving the field would pass a test that only pinned one.
