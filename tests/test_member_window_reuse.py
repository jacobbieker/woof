"""Reusing an ensemble member's fetch folder for another window prepares that window.

Breakage this prevents: a member fetch for leads f000/f006 was staged and
prepared; fetching the same member into the same folder for a longer or
shorter window and preparing again stopped with "The selected member
receipt has a different file count. Use a clean output directory.",
although every requested file was on disk and verified.  The staged tree
was keyed only by member and cycle, so the earlier window's receipt stood
in for the new one.  Each lead list now stages under its own folder, the
earlier tree and its input list stay exactly as they were, and a reused
tree is still byte-checked against its receipt.
