"""A sub-hourly grid's closing frame is judged by its own render's exit code.

Breakage these prevent: a render that fails partway can leave an
unfinished picture under a staging name in the scratch, and publishing
what the scratch held published that PNG as one of the frame's pictures.
On a 15-minute grid the closing frame was drawn alone and again, for its
rainfall windows, in a second pass into the same scratch whose exit code
was dropped.  It is now drawn in one pass beside every frame of its
hour; what that pass leaves is published whole only when it exited 0,
and otherwise only where a render receipt names it.
