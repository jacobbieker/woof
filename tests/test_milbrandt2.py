"""Milbrandt-Yau (WRF ``mp_physics = 9``) column smoke on the device.

WHAT IS TESTED: the SHIPPED seams -- ``DomainState`` allocation,
``initialize_physics``, ``woof.core.microphysics.apply`` and
``dycore.step`` -- asserted for finiteness, non-negativity, a physical
temperature band, moment-versus-mass consistency, and a column water
budget that must close against the precipitation the same call reports.
The budget runs three seeding layouts, and its docstring names the exact
source/sink terms each one resolves and the measured margin it resolves
them by; terms that are zero on all three columns are named as NOT
covered.  The last test is the mutation control: it stubs the scheme out
and proves the smoke's change detection then fails, so a passing smoke is
evidence about the port rather than about the harness.

WHAT IS NOT TESTED: anything comparing this port to the WRF v4.6.1
Fortran.  There is no ULP table, no column oracle and no matched forecast
trajectory for mp=9.  The declaration-only half of the suite is
``tests/test_milbrandt2_contract.py``.

    Column-integrated total water (vapour plus every condensate, mass

    WHAT THIS COVERS, EXACTLY.  A source/sink term at
    module_mp_milbrandt2mom.F:2708-2718 is detectable here only if it is
    NON-ZERO on the column being run -- conservation says nothing about a
    term that never fires.  So the test runs three seeding layouts, and
    each one asserts (below) that it actually drove the family it exists
    for rather than assuming it:

      ``cold``      the historical disjoint fixture.  Liquid is warm,
                    frozen is cold, no level carries both, so the whole
                    cloud/rain-frozen collection family is IDENTICALLY
                    ZERO here and only deposition and ice->snow
                    autoconversion move anything.
      ``riming``    supercooled cloud and rain co-located with snow,
                    graupel, hail and ice, so the collection family
                    (QCLcs, QCLcg, QCLch, QCLrs, QCLrg, QCLrh and the
                    Dxxx-routed products at :2713-2718) is live.
      ``melting``   snow, graupel and hail above the freezing level, so
                    QMLsr, QMLgr and QMLhr are live.

    THE GATE IS A MEASURED PIN, NOT A ROUND NUMBER.  Each layout's bound
    sits between its own baseline residual and the smallest residual a
    single dropped term produces, so the assertion resolves individual
    terms instead of merely bounding the total.  Measured on this tree,
    2026-08-09, RTX 5090, worst relative residual over the 6x5 column
    batch, one step (baseline -> single-term-drop, term deleted from ONE
    of the two lines it appears in):

      layout   baseline   gate      drop that this layout catches
      cold     6.40e-05   2.0e-04   QVDvs 4.72e-04, QCNis 1.04e-02
      riming   6.13e-05   1.2e-04   QCLrs 1.07e-02, QCLcs 5.60e-04,
                                    QCLcg 4.50e-04, QCLch 3.16e-04,
                                    QCLrh 1.61e-04
      melting  1.31e-04   2.4e-04   QMLsr 2.86e-02, QMLgr 1.60e-02,
                                    QMLhr 1.73e-03, QCLch 4.69e-04,
                                    QCLrh 3.23e-04

    The tightest margin in that table is QCLrh, caught at 1.34x its
    layout's gate; everything else clears by 2x or more.

    WHY THE EXTRA LAYOUTS EXIST.  On the ``cold`` fixture alone, deleting
    ``+ QCLcs`` from the QN line leaves every assertion passing and the
    output BIT-IDENTICAL -- the term is exactly zero there.  The same
    deletion moves the ``riming`` arm to 5.60e-04 and fails it.

    NOT COVERED even now: any term that is zero on all three columns
    (QNUvi, QIMsi/QIMgi, QCNgh and the number-only terms among them);
    every N-source/sink line at :2721-2728, which carries no mass and so
    cannot show up in a water budget at all; and any error that is
    sign-symmetric across the two lines a term appears in, because a term
    negated in BOTH places still conserves.  Only an oracle settles
    those, and none has been run.

    It is a BOUND, not an equality, and the bound is not a fudge: WRF
    itself leaks here.  Its overdepletion guard zeroes the
    three-component-freezing destination flags Dirg/Dirh (:2623-2625),
    Dsrs/Dsrg/Dsrh (:2640-2642) and Dgrg/Dgrh (:2655-2657) on a
    ``ratio == 0`` without zeroing every collection term they route, and
    the sedimentation sweep clamps ``QX = max(QX, 0)`` (:720).

    overdepletion pass then evaluates the ice source as
    ``QI + QNUvi + dim(QVDvi,0) + QFZci``, which is 0 because every cold
    term is 0 in the T>To arm, against a sink of QMLir; ``sour < sink``
    gives ``ratio = 0`` and QMLir/NMLir are scaled away (:2613-2622).  The
    apply step at :2711 then leaves QI at 0 and :2710 gives rain nothing.
