"""My forecasts in a real browser: a list reply read before a Move up never puts the old order back.

The defect: the page reads the list every few seconds and again after each
Move up, Move down or Remove, and drew whichever reply arrived, in arrival
order. A slow reply read before a Move up, arriving after the move had been
drawn, put the old order back on the page while the server kept the new one.

The shipped page runs in headless Chromium against the real page server with
two forecasts queued behind a busy card; only the delivery of one real reply
is held back.
