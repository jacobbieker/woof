"""Every registered radiation callable classifies cleanly (1.9.1 D3).

Shipped 1.9.0's RRTM longwave adapter stored ``p_top`` uncoerced
(woof/core/rrtm_lw.py), while its legacy-RRTMG sibling wraps the same
value in ``float()``.  ``initialize_physics`` hands over ``state.p_top``
-- a NumPy float32 SCALAR -- and the restart classifier's
``_is_array_like`` (shape+dtype+ndim) treats a NumPy scalar as an array.
``RADIATION_CALLABLE_ARRAYS`` has no ``p_top`` entry, so every
RRTM+Dudhia (1/1) run died with RestartManifestError in the end-of-run
canonical digest after a PERFECT integration: the false-failure class.

The class instrument: construct every radiation callable
``initialize_physics`` can register, with constructor inputs of the same
TYPES the production seam passes (NumPy-scalar ``p_top`` included), and
walk each through the restart classifier's own check.  Every attribute
must classify cleanly.  Red-on-revert: removing either ``float()``
coercion in woof/core/rrtm_lw.py, or the composed adapter's container
classification in woof/io/restart.py, fails this suite.

CPU-only via the NumPy-for-CuPy shim the RRTM suites already use;
adapters whose CONSTRUCTORS require CUDA assets are exercised by their
own GPU suites and the runs that use them, and are listed here so a new
registered adapter must either join the walk or state why not.
