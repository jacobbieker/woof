"""``woof doctor``'s verdict on whether this box can COMPILE a CUDA kernel.

This line exists because the gap it reports is silent by construction and
the advice that used to cover it was actively wrong.

Silent: cupy imports, cuBLAS loads, a matmul returns the right answer, and
every cheaper probe therefore passes on a box whose next uncached reduction
will not build.  A warm kernel cache hides it for weeks -- which is exactly
how it was found, on a box that had moved to a CUDA-13 toolkit and kept
serving cubins compiled under 12.

Wrong: the remedy on offer was ``pip install 'recast-woof[gpu-cu13]'``.  NVRTC --
the compiler -- ships INSIDE the CuPy wheel, and no CuPy wheel has ever
carried a CUDA header tree.  So that command reinstalls the piece that is
already present and supplies nothing that is missing, while pip reports
success.  A buyer on a fresh box follows it and watches the fault survive.

Every branch is forced here rather than left to whatever this box has,
because on a healthy box only one of them is reachable and the other three
are the ones a reader in trouble will actually see.

# reports success, and the fault survives: "fixed" that a default reader
# still hits is not fixed.  So the rule extends over docs/.
