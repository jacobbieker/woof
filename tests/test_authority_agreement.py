"""The two gatekeepers must not disagree about any configuration.

GPUWM has two independent authorities over "may this physics suite run", and
until this file existed nothing compared them:

* the registry's ``constraints`` machinery -- ``required_settings``,
  ``forbidden_setting_values`` and ``requires_components`` -- evaluated by
  :func:`woof.physics_registry.validate_physics_plan`, which is what a
  launcher shows a user *before* anything is prepared; and
* :func:`woof.config.validate_run_config`, which every RunConfig passes
  through on both the legacy and the experiment path, and which is therefore
  what actually decides whether a run starts.

They disagreed.  For the MYNN 5/5 suite with Noah the registry raised
``component-dependency: option 'noah' requires surface_layer in
[revised-mm5, classic-mm5]`` while ``validate_run_config`` returned OK -- and
that pair is the exact configuration the MYNN PBL option's own warning cites
as its runtime evidence (``tests/test_mynn_pbl_runtime.py:49``).  WRF was the
tiebreaker and the registry was wrong: ``share/module_check_a_mundo.F`` has no
``sf_sfclay_physics`` constraint for ``sf_surface_physics=2``, and
``phys/module_surface_driver.F:2386-2390`` hands ``SFCLAY_mynn`` the same
``chs/chs2/cqs2/cpm/flhc/flqc/qgh/qsfc`` exchange coefficients
``CASE (LSMSCHEME)`` consumes.  The constraint is gone; this file is what stops
the next one.

Two layers, because they answer different questions:

**Exhaustive component cross-product.**  All 4,032 combinations of the six
components' registered options, run through the shipped constraint evaluator
and through ``validate_run_config`` on the settings that evaluator resolved.
This is exhaustion, not sampling: the property is proven over the whole space
rather than over examples.  It needs a permissive runner route, because the
shipped routes deliberately do not let a user vary the PBL or the land-surface
model per domain -- so the route is synthesised here, and ONLY the route.  The
constraints, the options, the parameter specs and both authorities' code are
the shipped ones.  This is the layer the MYNN/Noah bug lived in, and note that
a reachable-only enumeration would have MISSED it: MYNN was unreachable, so
the disagreement was invisible from the selectable surface.

**Reachable surface.**  Every plan a user can actually build from the shipped
templates, routes, allowed component overrides and allowed per-domain
parameters.  Here the direction that matters is absolute: a plan the registry
calls launchable must survive the runtime's own battery, or the GUI is
offering something that will not start.

Scope, stated so it cannot drift: the two authorities do not have the same
field of view.  A route, a topology, a template registration or a tree-edge
transition is a question a single per-domain RunConfig cannot answer, and
``_REGISTRY_ONLY_CODES`` names those.  ``_SHARED_CODES`` names the ones both
authorities own, and a refusal carrying any of those must be a refusal on both
sides.  ``_INSTALL_STATE_CODES`` names a third kind, added after the mp=28
dataset refusal was tried in both of the other two: a question about the
MACHINE rather than about the configuration.  Those do not travel in
``errors`` at all -- ``validate_physics_plan`` reports them in
``install_state`` and leaves ``launchable`` to the plan -- and one that
turns up in ``errors`` anyway fails this gate, as does an error code in
neither of the other two sets, so a new code has to be classified by
whoever adds it.

#: conversion for a missing download and offered a way out

#:   dispatch, with the per-domain ``validate_run_preparation`` kept as a
#:   floor in ``woof.ingest.real.initialize_real``.
#: * ``asset-unresolved`` -> the scheme's own staging preflight and loader,

#:   scheme (``woof.prepared_domain_tree_forecast._verify_thompson_assets``
