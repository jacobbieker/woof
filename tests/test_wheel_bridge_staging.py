"""The wheel carries the Rust, and carries it in a usable state.

Four defects are pinned here, all of them found by building and
installing rather than by reading:

1. setuptools' ``build/lib*`` copy tree is not pruned between builds, so
   staging a second platform shipped BOTH platforms' binaries -- a
   "manylinux" wheel containing Windows ``.exe`` files, 105.99 MB, over
   PyPI's 100 MB cap.
2. The staged binaries installed 0644 under ``pip`` and the first
   ``subprocess.run`` died with ``PermissionError``.  Measured on a real
   Linux userland: 11/11 artifacts lacked the executable bit after
   ``pip install``.  Defect 4 below is the reason, found later; the
   repair in :func:`woof.bridges.ensure_executable` stays for wheels
   published before that fix.
3. A wheel with an empty ``libexec/bridges`` is indistinguishable from a
   correct one until a door is opened, so the staging tool must refuse
   rather than produce one.
4. The wheel stamped its staged artifacts ``0o755`` with no file-type
   bits, and pip's ``zip_item_is_executable`` requires ``S_ISREG``, so
   pip dropped the execute bits the stamping exists to set.  ``uv``,
   which does not apply that predicate, installed the same wheel 0775
   and hid it.
