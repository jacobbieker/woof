"""Device gates for the P3 CUDA port (``mp_physics=50``).

Split from tests/test_p3_cuda.py because tests/conftest.py marks a whole
module ``gpu`` as soon as cupy appears in a helper, and the CPU-side gates
in that file must still run on a CPU-only invocation.

Every gate here names the breakage it prevents.  The per-field agreement
against running Fortran is a campaign, not a test: it lives in
``evidence/p3-cuda-20260829/`` with the p3-fortref lane's fixtures and its

    eighteen ``(nk, ncol)`` companions live in the global workspace
    ``p3_device.make_workspace()`` allocates.  What is NOT structural is
    SPILLING: ``p3k_kloopmain`` sits at 244 registers and the fused
    ``p3k_fused_process`` at 250, against a 255-register ceiling, so
    another architecture or NVRTC build can spill where the recorded one
    did not.  A spilled frame would make the local-memory reservation
    under-charge by the frame times the whole resident-thread capacity,
