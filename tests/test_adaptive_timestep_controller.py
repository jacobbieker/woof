"""``AdaptiveTimestepController`` -- adapt_timestep's sequence over time.

SCOPE OF EVIDENCE, kept explicit because it is not uniform across this
campaign.  ``calc_dt`` is graded bit-exact against a captured oracle
(``test_adaptive_timestep_oracle.py``, 1728 rows).  The SEQUENCE this file
covers is not: ``adapt_timestep`` USEs module_domain / module_configure /
module_dm / module_bc_em, so a standalone Fortran harness for it is a
different order of work.  These gates pin the transcription's ORDER and
its behaviour over a trajectory, which is weaker than the oracle and is
labelled so rather than blurred into it.

The behaviours worth pinning are the ones that only appear over a
SEQUENCE -- a single call cannot show a ratchet.

    The intent is clear -- a step shortened to land on a frame has an
    artificially small CFL, so reusing it would over-grow the next step,
    and upstream reaches back to `last_max_*_cfl` instead.

    It only works for the HORIZONTAL.  The `use_last2` branch preserves
    both with no-op self-assignments, and then :405 assigns
    `grid%last_max_vert_cfl = grid%max_vert_cfl` UNCONDITIONALLY, two
    lines below the branch that just protected it.  So the vertical
    memory is overwritten every step and the protection never applies to
    it.

    This test asserts what the code DOES, not what it means to do.  A
    port that "fixed" the asymmetry would diverge from WRF on every run
    that steps to an output time -- which, with step_to_output_time
    defaulting true, is every adaptive run.  Written the other way round
