"""The one output-layering convention, and the ``woof setup`` wrapper.

Two complaints produced this module.  The CLI printed everything it
knew at once, so the next command was never findable; and a wheel
install still needed a list of staging chores nobody could infer the
order of.  The answers are one flag with one meaning everywhere, and
one command that runs the chores.

What these tests defend is the *contract*, not the wording: that both
halves of a layered message survive inside the exception, that the
default layer never hides a remedy, that every subcommand really does
take the flag the pointers name, and that setup never swallows a
refusal.

    `_EXPLAIN_ACTIVE` is module state, because library code that calls
    `explain.warn` has no `args` in reach.  `woof.cli.main` is also an
    ordinary function that plenty of callers run in-process rather than
    by spawning: the console script, an embedder driving the CLI, and
    the test suite.  A door that stamped the flag and never gave it back
    therefore handed the flag to the NEXT invocation, whose warnings
    then printed a mechanism continuation nobody asked for.

    tests/test_fetch_engine_degrade_guard.py` failed with 2 stderr lines
    where the guard contracts 1, and the same two files in the opposite
    order passed -- so a battery could report this tree red or green on
