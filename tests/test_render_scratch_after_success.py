"""A run that SUCCEEDED leaves no render working store behind.

MEASURED on the 2026-09-26 user sweep (finding F7), two Windows runs of
the 3 km GFS forecast: run b ended PASS with 741 MB of hour files in
``png.render-scratch/rwstore-<token>-*`` and 30 MB in
``run/wrfout.render-scratch/rwstore-*``, and the nested run c kept 50 MB
plus 3.9 MB.  About 0.8 GB per 24 h forecast, growing with the domain,
with no line in the run's events saying so.

Two faults made it, and both are pinned here:

* The removal could not reach the engine's hour files.  The engine files
  one hour at ``<store>/wrf/local_<init>_<64 hex>_<profile>_science_v1/
  f000.rws``, 147 characters below the store, so on that run (a
  104-character run folder) the full path was 294 to 296 characters.
  Windows refuses a path past 260 characters through the ordinary API
  unless long paths are switched on for the whole machine (they were
  not), so ``shutil.rmtree`` failed on every one of its retries with
  WinError 145, whatever it waited for.  The engine itself writes them
  through the extended-length spelling, which is why they exist at all.
* Nothing swept after a success.  The door that owns a render stage
  swept that stage's stores only when the stage FAILED, so a store the
  render could not remove stayed for good, and the render subprocess's
  own warning died with its captured stderr.
