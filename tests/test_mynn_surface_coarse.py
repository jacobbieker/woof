"""WRF-oracle parity for the MYNN surface layer above the 5 km DX threshold.

module_sf_mynn.F:584 adds a Beljaars (1995) subgrid-scale gust velocity to
the wind speed that every stability calculation below it is built on::

    VSGD = 0.32 * (max(DX/5000. - 1., 0.))**.33
    WSPD = SQRT(WSPD*WSPD + WSTAR*WSTAR + VSGD*VSGD)

``max(DX/5000.-1., 0.)`` is identically zero for every DX <= 5000 m, so the
narrow and widened fixtures -- both of which hardcode DX = 3000.0 in their
Fortran harnesses -- pin only VSGD == 0.  The live half of the branch was
never compared against WRF at all, and every 12 km parent domain runs it on
every column of every timestep.

``woof/data/mynn/oracle/surface-layer-coarse.csv`` closes that: the same
unmodified SFCLAY1D_mynn, the same ten columns as the widened fixture, swept
across DX = 3000 / 5000 / 5001 / 12000 / 27000 m over the widened fixture's
three stages -- (itimestep, isfflx) = (1, 1), (2, 1) and (1, 0)
(``tools/mynn_wrf461_oracle/run_surface_layer_coarse.F90``, built by
``build_coarse.sh`` against the same pinned WRF commit and source hash).

The ISFFLX=0 stage was the hole in the previous revision of this sweep: the
fixture carried only (1, 1) and (2, 1), so the arm of :1027-1044 that leaves
HFX/QFX and the exchange coefficients at zero instead of diagnosing them was
never run at any spacing above the threshold.  It is now.

The DX = 3000 rows of the fixture reproduce the pinned widened fixture bit for
bit -- all three stages -- which is what makes DX the only variable that
changed.

# The FP32 ULP distance from this oracle, measured per (stage, output,
# column) -- one integer per compared number, in ``CASES`` order -- where a
# stage is one (dx, itimestep), not one dx.  An output a stage does not name is
# bitwise on every column there and is required to stay bitwise: the lookup
# returns zeros.  There is no margin to justify, because there is no margin:
# each entry is the residue measured at that element and the gate is
# ``residue <= entry`` column by column.
#
# The previous revision keyed one table per DX, maxed over both timesteps and
# all ten columns.  Measured on this machine that left 190744 ULP of unearned
# margin and 322 of 1050 (stage, output) comparisons unable to fail on a 1-ULP
# regression, the worst by +118.
#
# The residue has the same two causes it has at DX = 3000 and no third one:
#
#   * CPU -- QFX/LH lead at 10-11 ULP because ``FLQC*(QSFCMR-QV1)`` cancels
#     three or four significant digits; the columns show it sitting in
#     ``midres_water`` and ``land_qsfc_unset``.  The rest tracks NumPy's
#     float32 exp/log/pow against the glibc functions gfortran linked.
#   * CUDA -- every large entry is in the ``thin_land_log10_wind`` column,
#     eighth of ten, documented in ``test_mynn_surface_gpu.py``: ``powf`` is
#     one ULP off gfortran on its level-1 Exner factor and the DTHVDZ
#     cancellation amplifies that into BR/ZOL/RMOL/PSIM and everything below.
#
# What matters for *this* fixture is that neither grows with DX.  WSPD, the
# output VSGD actually enters, is bitwise on the CPU and 1 ULP on CUDA at every
# spacing in the sweep, and BR is bitwise on the CPU throughout.  The DX > 5 km
# branch is reproduced exactly by both ports.
#
# ``CPU_ULP`` is the elementwise maximum over THREE NumPy builds -- Windows
# NumPy 2.2.6 / CPython 3.13.7, which runs pytest on this box; the WSL
# Ubuntu-24.04 NumPy 2.4.3 / CPython 3.12.3 that ``build_coarse.sh`` runs
# ``validate_coarse_oracle.py`` under; and Ubuntu-22.04 NumPy 2.5.1 / CPython
# 3.12.13 on the second RTX 5090 host.  The full derivation is in the note in
# ``tests/test_mynn_surface.py``; in short, the three disagree at 212 of the
# 3750 elements measured here, and for exactly two reasons: NumPy's float32
# ``arctan``, which 2.5.1 makes bit-identical to the glibc ``atanf`` gfortran
# linked and the two older builds do not, and NumPy's float32 ``**``, which is
# the platform ``powf`` -- glibc's on both Linux builds, the MSVC runtime's on
# Windows.  A table measured on one platform alone is red on the others: the
# previous revision's was Windows-only and had been failing 13 comparisons
# under WSL, and the two-platform revision before this one failed six
# comparisons here under NumPy 2.5.1.
#
# Three entries below are marked ``+2.5.1``: they are the only ones in this
# file that the third build raised, each by exactly 1 ULP, and they cost the
# other two builds 6 ULP of bite between them.  NumPy 2.5.1 is nonetheless the
# build closest to WRF overall -- 1540 ULP summed over the 5150 CPU elements
# of this file and ``test_mynn_surface.py``, against 1753 for 2.2.6 and 1866
# for 2.4.3.
#
# ``GPU_ULP`` is unchanged by any of this: it was measured on Windows / NVRTC
# 13.0, and it is green unaltered on the second host's NVRTC 12.8 / driver
# 570.133.20, so the kernel's residue does not carry a platform axis the way
# the NumPy reference does.
#
# These are ratchets: lower them as the FP32 shims are unified, never raise.

#: ``GPU_ULP`` per compiler where a compiler reads it differently, keyed
#: on (compute capability, NVRTC major.minor), the pair measured.
#: A146 re-recorded this table: NVRTC had compiled every float division
#: by a compile-time constant as a multiply by the rounded reciprocal on
#: Blackwell, and the kernels now spell those divisions ``__fdiv_rn``, the
#: IEEE quotient.  On sm_120 41 rows read more than ``GPU_ULP``, by 1 to 2 ULP, all on
#: qgh, qsfc, qstar, lh and qfx at the last two columns, zol/rmol/psim/psih and
#: the exchange coefficients at a few; every other row reads at or below it,
#: most of the thin_land_log10_wind column's 36 to 118 ULP now 0 to 3.
#: MEASURED 2026-09-30 on the RTX 5070 Ti (sm_120, NVRTC 13.4.92) at the
