"""Every number ``mp28-matched-trajectory.md`` publishes is read back.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.  The matched-trajectory document was written by hand
from comparison receipts that lived only on the run node.  Four of its
published numbers did not match those receipts:

* it said the t = 0 field difference was "exactly 0.0 for every field" when
  the receipt records ``T`` at 2.5e-09 and ``QNWFA``/``QNIFA`` at 2e-08;
* it counted V3 failures for WOOF over the 111 scalar rows ("7 of 111")
  and for the control over all 195 -- two denominators in one table row;
* it published the domain aerosol budget agreement as 1.6e-04 when the
  series give 1.530e-04;
* it claimed a dual-run byte screen on the short window that the
  short-window tool did not perform.

None of them changed a conclusion, which is exactly why none of them would
have been noticed.  A document that republishes a measurement drifts from it
unless something compares the two, so this compares the two.  The receipts
are committed beside the document (``docs/public/receipts/``) precisely so
that the comparison is possible in a checkout, on any machine, with no GPU
and no run directory.

This gate is one-directional in the same way the registry/PHYSICS.md gate
is: the page may say MORE than the receipts, but every number it does
publish must be the receipt's.
