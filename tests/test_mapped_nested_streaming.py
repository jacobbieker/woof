"""The nested-domain path must stay one valid time deep.

A mapped preparation streams its forcing series: the frameset is opened
rather than read, and the regular-source snapshots pack one valid time
when that valid time is asked for.  The hierarchy path -- every nested
preparation, which is every run with a child domain -- joins that series
to a static catalog through :class:`NestedInputCatalog` and then selects
ONE snapshot per child at its start time.

Named breakage: a catalog that copies the series into a tuple holds
every valid time's arrays for the whole preparation, which is exactly
the residency the streamed decode exists to avoid.  On a 3 km CONUS
source with a 45-level ladder one valid time is gigabytes, so a flat
catalog puts a seven-time nested run back where the OOM reaper found it.

These tests measure residency directly: the double below creates a fresh
snapshot per index and counts how many are alive at once, so a consumer
that retains the series shows a peak equal to the number of valid times
and a consumer that streams shows one.
