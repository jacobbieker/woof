"""Negative control for ``tools/check_parameter_claims.py``.

``tests/test_physics_registry_declarations.py`` asserts the gate PASSES on
the real tree, which is only evidence if the gate can also fail.  These pins
hold the other half: each builds a scratch root where the citation is
deliberately hollow and asserts the gate rejects it.

The hollow forms are the ones the gate promises to catch -- a knob named in
a module docstring, in a class or function docstring, in either quote style,
or in a comment.  The last two pins guard the opposite regression: a knob
read through a non-docstring string literal is real code and must still
pass, and a citation that does not parse must fail closed rather than
silently prove nothing.
