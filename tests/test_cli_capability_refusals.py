"""The front door refuses before expensive work, and every remedy is real.

These tests are written to run against an INSTALLED WHEEL as well as a
checkout: nothing here imports a repository fixture, reads a repository
path, or needs a card.  A source checkout has everything on the path and
hides exactly the defects this file is about, so the same file is run
against the wheel in a clean venv as the proof of record.

Every assertion is one of three shapes:

* the refusal FIRES when the capability is missing;
* the refusal is SILENT when it is present (an instrument that always
  says "missing" measures nothing);
* the remedy RESOLVES -- the extra exists and is non-empty, the command
  is a real subcommand, the flag is a real flag.
