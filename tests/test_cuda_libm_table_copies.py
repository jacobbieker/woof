"""Every CUDA transcription of a glibc libm table, held to one spelling.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS
--------------------------
``0x3FEFD9B0D3158574`` -- row 1 of glibc's ``__exp2f_data`` -- is written out
by hand in **eight** ``.cu`` files and once more, in Python, in
``woof/core/noahmp_libm.py``.  Nine independent transcriptions of one table.

The 2026-08-28 fault-injection audit corrupted that row by ONE ULP and
measured what the estate does about it:

* in ``noahmp_soilwater.cu`` alone -- caught in 4.5 s by
  ``tests/test_noahmp_kernel_source_scans.py``, and only because
  ``noahmp_water.cu`` happens to carry a verbatim copy of the same SECTION,
  so a text-equality check on that pair notices.  That gate is a duplication
  artefact, not a table gate.
* the same ULP applied to ``noahmp_soilwater.cu`` AND ``noahmp_water.cu``
  together, so the pair still agrees -- **NOT CAUGHT** by anything.
* the same ULP in ``noahmp_snow.cu``, one of the six copies no equality check
  covers at all -- **NOT CAUGHT** by anything.

A one-ULP error in an exp2f table is a wrong exponential in a land-surface
kernel on every GPU column, on every step, for the life of the release.
Nothing in the estate compared any ``.cu`` table against the Python spelling,
and nothing compared the copies against each other.  This is that comparison.

WHAT IT ASSERTS
---------------
1. Every ``__constant__ unsigned long long`` table with the same NAME SUFFIX
   (``EXP2F_TAB``, ``LOGF_TAB``, ...) holds identical values in every kernel
   source that declares it.  A single drifted copy names itself.
2. Every such suffix that has a Python counterpart in
   ``woof.core.noahmp_libm`` equals it bit pattern for bit pattern.  This is
   the anchor that survives all eight copies drifting TOGETHER, which is the
   case cross-copy equality cannot see.
3. A suffix appearing in the kernels that this file does not register is a
   failure, so a newly hand-transcribed table cannot arrive unguarded.

The scan is text only: no CUDA device, no nvcc, no kernel import.
