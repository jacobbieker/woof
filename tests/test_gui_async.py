"""New forecast never waits: the source rows arrive on their own, and forecasts queue for the card.

Two defects this file holds shut:

- The When step sat on "Checking which data holds this start..." for
  minutes, and on a second visit drew no calendar at all.  Every source
  was put to the fetch's object probe inside the request, one HEAD after
  another with a 60 s timeout, NOMADS HEADs queued behind a running
  forecast's downloads in the node's governor, and ICON alone asked about
  300 objects in series (205 s for a recent start and 138 s for a 2024
  one, measured on a node running a forecast).  ``/api/sources`` asked the same probe before
  the page could draw anything, and so did every fit.
- A second forecast could not be started while one ran: the card lock
  refused it, and there was nowhere to leave it.
- A 1996 date, and a fit for a 2021 event, still asked every host about
  today's runs (91 s, 22 s), and the start check and the newest-start
  check each asked the same GEM cycle's 174 objects.  The fetch's own
  check before a run downloads asked those objects one at a time.

No server is asked here: every HEAD is a stand-in.
