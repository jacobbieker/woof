"""The UCM's Noah-MP coupling against WRF v4.7.1, bit for bit.

``tools/urban_wrf471_oracle/ucm_noahmp_oracle.F90`` calls the byte-unmodified
``noahmp_urban`` (``phys/noahmp/drivers/wrf/module_sf_noahmpdrv.F`` at
noahmp e5c0859) with ``sf_urban_physics = 1`` on the grid fields noahmplsm
leaves, then runs WRF's own option-1 surface-driver override block
(``module_surface_driver.F:3383-3405``, extracted verbatim by the build):
eleven urban columns and one grass column, four carried steps, the three
NLCD types, FRC 1.0 and 0.05, weak exchange (the 1.0E-02 floors and
``CHS2 = CQS2``), day, calm night and rain.

**Measured: every blended grid field (TSK HFX QFX LH GRDFLX ALBEDO QSFC UST
CHS CHS2 CQS2), every urban state word, every per-step urban output, and
the override block's Q2 U10 V10 PSIM PSIH GZ1OZ0 AKHS AKMS are bit-identical
to WRF on all 44 urban column steps**, from recorded and from carried state;
the grass column is untouched.

**T2 and TH2 carry a declared divergence** (one of the urban port's two;
the other is YSU's rural drag under BEP, ``tests/test_ysu_bep_rural_drag.py``)
and are bit-identical to WRF
built with it (``build_ucm_noahmp.sh`` with ``UCM_T2_TEMPERATURE_FIX=1``,
fixture ``ucm-noahmp-t2fix.csv.gz``): WRF's ``module_surface_driver.F:3393``
divides the UCM's 2 m value by ``(1.E5/PSFC)**RCP`` as if it were a
potential temperature, but ``module_sf_urban.F:1686`` builds it from TS and
TA, both absolute temperatures (TA_URB = T3D, noahmpdrv.F:3392; WRF's own
note at module_sf_urban.F:1679).  The stock and fixed fixtures differ in
T2/TH2 on the urban rows and in nothing else, which the last test pins.

Made to fire before commit: deleting the kernel's ``CHS2 = CQS2`` (WRF's
noahmpdrv.F:3445) fails both parametrizations on T2, TH2 and TH2_URB2D over
40 rows.  One mutation that did not fire, recorded so nobody reads it as
coverage: moving ``RCP`` by one ULP changes ``(1.E5/PSFC)**RCP`` by about
3e-10 relative at these pressures, below float32 resolution.
