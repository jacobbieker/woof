"""The physics-fidelity axis, its refusals, and the ledger it resolves.

Three things are pinned here and each one is a different failure the axis
exists to prevent:

1. ABSENCE IS INERT.  A configuration that does not name the axis resolves
   exactly as it did before the axis existed.  This is the pin that lets the
   axis land in a tree whose whole point is bitwise reproducibility.
2. THE MODE IS THE AUTHOR.  When the axis is named it writes its keys and
   refuses a second author, in either mode.  A merge here would produce a
   run whose receipt names an arm it did not integrate.
3. THE VECTOR IS FROZEN BY VERSION.  ``patchset = "v1"`` resolves the same
   entries tomorrow as today, and an entry the ledger holds back (SASE's
   entry gate, the dormant class-C rows) cannot be smuggled into a vector.

# This probe is a REAL case (it has a [projection]) that runs Noah with no

# woof.physics_compat.radiation_off_land_surface_refusal refuses at load:
# nothing computes the downward longwave Noah reads every surface step.  The
# axis under test here is the physics-fidelity one and its 60 seconds never
# read a surface budget, so the probe DECLARES the experiment rather than
# muting the guard -- the same answer the shipped 60-second VRAM/step-cost
# probes give, and it keeps every arm below loading through the real front
# door instead of a fixture-only bypass.
#
# BOTH tokens, for the same reason the shipped probes carry both: radiation
# entirely off under a land surface is the one class the two 1.8.8 guards
# overlap on, and they ask different questions -- "nothing computes my sky"
# and "the number my land surface integrates is one I typed".  Dropping
# either one puts this fixture back behind a refusal.
