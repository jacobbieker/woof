"""The Rust workspaces' battery list, kept in sync with the workspaces.

``tools/battery/cargo_gates.txt`` is how the release battery finds the
Cargo test suites.  The 2026-08-12 project ruling ("probably we would want
tests right") made them a leg; this suite is the gate on the list, the
same kind of gate ``tests/test_stage1_manifest.py`` is on the stage-1
list and ``tests/test_tiles_gate_manifest.py`` is on the ``[tiles]``
gates.

It carries one property those two do not, and it is the point of the
file: the list is checked against the workspace manifests in BOTH
directions.  Every entry has to name a real member package, and every
member package has to have an entry.  The second direction is the
accepted-implies-builds pattern (``tests/test_mp_accepted_builds.py``)
applied to a battery list rather than to a physics menu: a crate that
joins ``tools/rustwx/Cargo.toml``'s ``members`` turns THIS suite red
until somebody writes its line in the list, so a new crate cannot land
already ungated.  That is how a crate arriving from another lane -- the
Rust MPAS work is the live example -- joins the leg, and it needs no
edit here to happen.

Cheap and hermetic on purpose: it reads three text files and two
``Cargo.toml``s, needs no Rust toolchain and no card, so it runs on
every commit rather than at a cut.  What it CANNOT check is that the
suites pass -- that is the leg itself,
``tools/battery/run_cargo_gates.py``.
