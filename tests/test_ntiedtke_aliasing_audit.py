"""The aliasing audit is a GATE, not a receipt.

`woof/data/ntiedtke/oracle/nt-aliasing-audit.txt` lists every dummy in
`cu_ntiedtke.F90` whose INCOMING value is essential -- either read
before it is written, or an ``intent(out)`` written only inside a branch so
that a column missing the branch keeps the caller's value.

Two things depend on that list being exact:

* every HARNESS must pass the caller's live arrays for those names.  A
  harness that passes fresh arrays produces a capture that is silently
  wrong, and no self-consistency check inside the harness catches it --
  the harness agrees with itself.  That is how the cutypen fixture shipped
  wrong, and only the NumPy mirror disagreeing with it surfaced the bug.

* every KERNEL must LEAVE THOSE SLOTS ALONE rather than initialising them.
  The natural CUDA idiom of zeroing outputs at entry diverges from WRF on
  every column that misses the branch, and the fixture is 66 of 108
  non-triggering -- so that idiom would be wrong on most of it.

So a change to the list is a change to both contracts.  This test re-runs
the audit and fails if the answer moved: a new routine, an edited
signature, or someone "simplifying" a conditional write into an
unconditional one would all silently invalidate work already graded.

It SKIPS when the WRF source is not reachable, which is the ordinary case
on a machine without the tree.  It never passes vacuously: when the source
is present its digest is checked against the pinned v4.6.1 value first, so
auditing some other file cannot be mistaken for agreement.
