"""The spectral-comparison pin owner's deferred guards, each one measured.

Four defects in the v2 comparison class, one in its receipt gate surface, and
one in its reader.  Every threshold this suite pins was MEASURED first; the
measurement and the margin derivation are recorded beside the constant in
``woof.verify.spectral_compare`` and in
``docs/public/SPECTRAL_VERIFICATION.md``.

1. BAND-EDGE ROUNDING.  ``_band_mask`` compared a wavelength recovered as
   ``1/|k|`` against a declared edge with no allowance, while the Nyquist
   edge in the same module already carried an 8-ulp one.  Measured over
   2,414,712 retained modes on 48 grids (n 64..400, dx 250..5000 m), 80 modes
   were graded into the wrong band, and every one of them was a |j|=1
   domain-scale mode -- the most energetic mode the disk retains.  Which band
   it lands in depended on the float spelling of dx, so n=100/dx=1000 and
   n=200/dx=500 -- the same physical wavelength -- disagreed.

2. ZERO-VARIANCE GUARD.  The guard was ``denominator > 0.0``, which only
   catches an exactly-zero band power.  Measured: a plane held at a constant
   273.15 K detrends to float cancellation residue, not to zero, and scores
   ``spectral_correlation = 0.9999999999999997`` with ``status = "ok"`` --
   a field with no structure at all passing a 0.95 correlation gate.  Whether
   it does depends on whether the constant is a dyadic rational: 1.0 and
   101325.0 give exact zero, 273.15 does not.

3. GATE-METRIC DUPLICATION.  The synthetic ``partition`` row carried a
   verbatim copy of the ``total`` component's ``reference_power`` so the
   ``minimum_reference_power`` floor could be enforced.  That copy was
   gate-addressable, so a gate declaring ``component = "partition"``,
   ``metric = "reference_power"`` silently graded the total-KE row, and the
   calibrator built two gates out of one measurement.

4. CROSS-BOX TOLERANCE.  Measured 2026-08-20 on sha256-identical input and
   module bytes: the Windows desktop (Python 3.13.7, numpy 2.2.6, UCRT) and
   a development machine (Python 3.14.4, numpy 2.3.5, glibc 2.43) agree on 103 of
   279 metric values to the bit and differ on the rest.  The receipt
   self-hash is therefore a THIS-BOX identity, exactly as the portable frame
   header rule already says for a decode; what travels is the metric values
   under a declared tolerance.

5. NAN CEILING.  The reader's ceiling on non-finite cells is zero, which is
   right -- one NaN cell propagates through the FFT into every retained mode,
   so every band power, correlation and gate on the whole plane becomes NaN.
   The refusal did not say that, did not say how many cells or where, did not
   separate "empty" from "non-finite", and named no remedy.
