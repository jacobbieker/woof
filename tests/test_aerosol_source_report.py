"""The mp=28 aerosol source reaches report.json, and only where it applies.

TWO CLAIMS, and the second is the one with teeth.

  1. A real aerosol-aware Thompson preparation's report names WHICH source
     initialized nwfa/nifa, and pins the dataset it read by content --
     path, byte count and computed SHA-256 -- so two runs against two WRF
     releases' copies of QNWFA_QNIFA_SIGMA_MONTHLY.dat stay tellable apart
     afterwards.  Before this, the only place that fact was ever spoken
     was the preparing process's stderr.

  2. A run under a scheme that has no water-friendly/ice-friendly aerosol
     fields gains NO key.  Not ``dataset_used: false``, not
     ``aerosol_source: null``, nothing.  "This scheme has no such fields"
     and "this mp=28 run could not find the dataset and ran on an analytic
     profile" are different facts, and a key that renders both as an
     absence puts a WSM6 forecast and a fallen-back aerosol-aware forecast
     in the same bucket -- which is exactly the pair a reader consults
     this receipt to tell apart.

The suite is CPU-only.  The climatology test needs WRF's 225 MB dataset,
which this tree does not redistribute, and locates it the way the PRODUCT
does (``resolve_wif_climatology``) so it cannot pass on a path the
shipping code would not have found; it skips where there is no copy.
