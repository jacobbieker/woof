"""Every legacy-RRTMG construction site, and who fails closed on ozone.

A RESIDENT nest under `ra_rrtmg_variant='rrtmg_legacy'` with `o3input = 2`
takes its ozone INTERPOLATED FROM THE PARENT: WRF runs the climatology
chain on `id == 1` only and hands a nest the root's field through the
`rdf=(p2c)` forcing stream the Registry declares on `o3rad`
(Registry/Registry.EM_COMMON:1264).  A resident child built without a
parent to take it from does not refuse on its own; it silently evaluates
a fresh climatology on its OWN latitudes and reports
`"ozone_routing": "root-climatology"` for a nested domain.  That is a
fail-OPEN, and `o3input = 2` is the RunConfig default.

This file is about the RESIDENT routes.  The OFFLINE child route
(`woof.offline_child_run`) is a different case and is pinned in
tests/test_offline_child_ozone.py: that domain is configured as a WRF root
and stamps `parent_id = 0`, so WRF's own answer for it is the climatology
on its own grid, which it evaluates and declares as
`"ozone_routing": "child-grid-climatology"`.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL, rather than more assertions in
tests/test_rrtmg_legacy_wiring.py: that module imports cupy at module
scope, so conftest's AST auto-marker marks the WHOLE module `gpu` and
`GPUWM_NO_LOCAL_GPU` skips every test in it.  The guard it was pinning
therefore had no CPU-side coverage at all, which is why the 1.8.0 CPU leg
was green while the GPU leg was red.  This module imports no cupy in any
of the three triggering positions (module scope, a fixture, a non-`test_`
helper), so it stays CPU-side.  Importing `woof.runtime` at module scope
is fine: the detector reads this file's own source, not `sys.modules`.

WHY BEHAVIOURAL, rather than `inspect.getsource` string matching: the
previous pin asserted `"radiation_parent is None" in
inspect.getsource(runtime.prepare_child_case)` and went red in 1.8.0 for
a refactor that MOVED the guard into `_child_radiation_adapter` while
preserving it exactly -- and which closed a hole, since the new
mid-run spawn/relocation construction site is guarded by the same code.
The pin could not tell "guard deleted" from "guard relocated".  These
call the guard and watch it fire.
