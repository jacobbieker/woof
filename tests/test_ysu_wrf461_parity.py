"""YSU against the byte-unmodified WRF v4.6.1 module, for the first time.

``bl_pbl_physics=1`` is the PBL scheme in every registry template, and until
this file existed no WRF number had ever been produced for it: the CUDA kernel
was checked only against ``woof.verify.npref.np_ysu_column``, a float64 mirror
of the same transcription, so a misread line in the transcription agreed with
itself.  ``tools/ysu_wrf461_oracle/`` now drives ``bl_ysu_run`` in the pinned
tree and dumps every input and output; this module measures the kernel against
that dump and pins what it measures.

**The numbers below are a measurement, not a target.**  They record what the
shipped kernel actually does, so that it cannot change without someone saying
so in a commit.  They are asserted for *equality*, not as an upper bound: a
kernel that got better silently is as much a drift as one that got worse, and
the whole point of this file is that the residual is documented.  Every
baseline here was produced twice -- on the local RTX 5090 (Windows driver) and
on a rented RTX 5090 (Linux, CUDA 12.9, cupy 14.1.1) -- and every maximum was
identical on both.  The *count* of differing lanes was not, so no count is
pinned.

Three fixture columns are held out of the ULP table and asserted separately, by
:func:`test_the_three_documented_behavioural_divergences_are_exactly_these`.
They do not measure arithmetic; each is a place where the port and WRF take
different branches, and folding a branch disagreement into a ULP maximum hides
it behind a big number:

* case 7  -- ``br`` is the smallest positive subnormal.  WRF's ``br > 0`` is
  true and the column is stable; CuPy's unconditional ``-ftz=true`` flushes the
  subnormal so the kernel's ``br <= 0.0f`` is also true and the column is
  convective.  Two different regimes, not two roundings.
* case 12 -- ``ust``, ``hfx`` and ``qfx`` are all exactly zero.  ``ysu.cu``
  returns zero tendencies; WRF has no such short circuit and computes a
  703 m PBL with nine levels in it.
* case 13 -- ``ust`` is a subnormal, so ``-ftz`` makes case 12's short circuit
  fire on a nonzero input.  WRF meanwhile divides 0 by 0 in ``prfac2`` and
  fills the column with NaN.

#: as it ships.  Each cause below was isolated by patching exactly one
#: expression in ysu.cu and re-measuring on both GPUs, in

#:                            (bl_ysu.F90:1103).  The tendency is a difference
#:                            of two ~300 K numbers, so the two associations
#:                            differed by one ULP of theta = 3.4e-07 K/s after
#:                            rdt -- which is ~8.8e8 ULP of a tendency WRF
#:                            rounds to exactly zero.  The 1 ULP that is left
#:                            is WRF's own ttnp*pi2d / pi2d round trip, proved
#:                            lane by lane in
#:                            test_the_last_dtheta_ulp_is_wrfs_own_pi2d_round_trip
#:                            -- so the kernel's theta tendency IS WRF's, and
#:                            the residue is WRF undoing its own multiply.
#:   hpbl   112 -> 1          CLOSED.  ``ep1`` is now ``RV/RD - 1.0f`` rather
#:   exch_h 283 -> 7          than ``RVOVRD - 1.0f``: CUDA_DEFINES["RVOVRD"] is
#:   exch_m  48 -> 7          RV/RD in Python *doubles*, rounded once to
#:   dv   46604 -> 23302      float32, and WRF's EP_1 is the float32 quotient.
#:                            They differ by 1 ULP at 1.608, so ep1 differed by
#:                            2 ULP at 0.608, and thv, the Richardson profile
#:                            and the whole PBL diagnosis inherited it.  The
#:                            right-hand column is what is pinned below.
#:   nothing                  ``ust**3.`` spelled as powf rather than us*us*us;
#:                            cbrtf rather than powf(x, 1/3f); WRF's exact
#:                            association for fric, xkzm, prnumfac and entfac.
#:                            All four measured; all four worth zero here.
#:
#: What no respelling reaches is CUDA's expf/powf against glibc's,
#: amplified by the implicit solve: exch_h/exch_m stay 7 ULP (2.4e-04 m2/s) and
#: the momentum and moisture tendencies stay 1457/23302 ULP -- but only
#: 4.2e-08 m/s2 and 3.1e-11 kg/kg/s in absolute terms, because those tendencies
