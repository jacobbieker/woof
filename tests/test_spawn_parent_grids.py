"""A dormant nest's watch and its re-arm belong to the grid it is nested on.

Two defects shared one cause: spawn state was kept at a coarser key than
the thing it belongs to.

- Footprints.  A live nest's footprint is cell numbers on its PARENT's
  grid.  The controller handed every footprint to every watch, so d02's
  placement on d01 (cells 30..50 of d01) masked cells 30..50 of d02, and a
  storm there never fired the dormant d03 nested on d02: it stayed dormant
  with a ``no-signal`` receipt.  The same held for a nest born on d01 at
  the same boundary.
- Re-arming.  A retired slot re-armed only when its parent was the root
  or a SPAWNED episode, so a nest below a permanent d02 retired once and
  never came back, whatever its cooldown and firing budget said.

The boundary decisions here run through the real ``SpawnRunner`` and
``SpawnController`` on configs the real loader accepts; only the newborn's
materialization is stubbed (``_stub_materializer``), as in
tests/test_spawn_runner.py.
