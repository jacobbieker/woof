"""The public support matrix and the adapter ledger must agree, checked.

``woof/native_wrf_support_v1.json`` (what ``rw-wps --show-support-matrix``
prints) and ``woof.source_adapters.source_capability_manifest()`` (the
evidence ledger the code maintains) describe the same certifications, are
edited by different commits, and until this file existed were tested only
against themselves.  That is a drift class, and it produced a real instance
on the 2.5.0 line: the ledger invalidated the ERA5 NetCDF mapped-composition
gate (the shipped mapping gained the time/valid_time accepted-spelling list,
``replacement_status: stock_wrf_regate_required``) while the JSON kept
v2.4.1's ``genuine_era5_single_domain_stock_wrf_proof_passed`` -- a public
certification claim the code itself said no longer held.  The sibling GRIB2
entry was updated when its gate was re-earned, which is exactly how the two
files drift: each edit updates the file it lives in.

Every test here reads BOTH sides and fails on contradiction, so the next
invalidation (or re-certification) that touches only one file fails CI
instead of shipping a false public claim.
