"""No workspace slot may be written by a stage and read by none.

WHAT THIS CATCHES, and why it exists. ``ntiedtke_momentum_rescale``
(cumastrn:996-1016) applies a per-column limiter to the mass flux and
writes the result to ``zmfuus``/``zmfdus``. cumastrn:1026 hands THOSE to
cududvn. WOOF's ``ntiedtke_cududvn`` declares its parameters ``pmfu`` and
``pmfd`` -- the reference's own dummy names -- and the assembler binds
arguments by name, so it found the slots literally called ``pmfu`` and
``pmfd`` and passed the UNSCALED flux. The rescale's output was written and
read by nothing; the whole stage was dead.

The kernel's own header says "pmfu/pmfd MUST BE THE SCALED PAIR ... the
unscaled pair would be wrong on exactly the columns the rescaling touched".
The requirement was understood, written at the call site, and agreed with
nothing. That is this campaign's recurring failure -- resolution by
apparent identity -- and a comment cannot be the check.

Measured consequence before the fix: on a live 4.5 km column the limiter
binds at zmfs = 0.33333334 and the convective momentum came out exactly
1/zmfs = 3x WRF's. The 18-column analytic fixture never sees it: the cap
does not bind anywhere in it -- the closest column reaches 0.5076 -- so
every kernel still graded at max_ulp == 0.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH, stated here rather than left to be discovered.
This gate is necessary and NOT sufficient. It fires only because nothing
read ``zmfuus``. The property that actually failed is narrower: a parameter
named ``pmfu`` was bound to the slot named ``pmfu`` while its own contract
required the scaled pair. Had any other stage read ``zmfuus`` for any
reason, this gate would pass and cududvn would still be misbound. The
complement -- asserting each stage's consumers against the reference call
graph -- is not written. Do not read a green run here as "every binding is
right"; read it as "no stage's output is unreachable".
