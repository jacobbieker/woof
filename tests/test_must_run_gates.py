"""A gate whose fixtures ship must RUN, and one that cannot must say so.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS
--------------------------
``tools/battery/no_silent_deselection.py`` and ``tools/battery/
list_census.json`` count COLLECTED items -- the plugin says so at
``pytest_collection_finish``, and the census records nothing but a per-file
collected count.  A ``skipif``-marked item is collected.  So a deck whose
every test skips contributes its full count, clears its floor, and the leg is
green: the instrument written to detect "coverage that left" is blind to the
way coverage most often leaves.

The worked example is in this tree.  ``tools/rrtmg_wrf461_oracle/lw_gate.py
:23-26`` resolves the RRTMG longwave fixture root to

    os.path.expanduser("~/.woof/oracle/rrtmg_lw/fixtures")

-- an oracle scratch directory that no clone carries -- and
``tests/test_rrtmg_lw_numpy.py:38`` is a whole-module ``skipif`` on that
directory existing.  It exists in no clone, so 100% of the longwave gates
skip everywhere, inside a module whose own line 92 reads *"this gate must
never silently skip again"*.  Nothing in the repository went red, because
nothing in the repository was asking whether a gate RAN.

WHAT THIS FILE IS
-----------------
The static half of ``tools/battery/must_run_gates.txt``:

* every must-run entry is a real file, needs no GPU, and (if it declares an
  unbounded skip count) says why;
* every declared-skipping entry is a real file and carries a reason;
* **every module-level skip gate in the tree is in one half or the other** --
  so a new deck cannot start skipping silently, it has to be declared.

and the negative controls for the runtime half, ``tools/battery/
no_silent_skip.py``, run as real pytest sessions against synthetic gates: a
gate that skips everything must make the session RED, and the same gate
passing must leave it green.  A guard whose failure path is never exercised
is the shape this whole file exists to refuse.
