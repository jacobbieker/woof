"""Bridge binaries staged for release carry the revision they were built from.

The 1.4.1 cut nearly shipped prepared bridge bundles that predated the
source tip -- the two platform zips were not even the same source
revision.  Every existing release check hashed the bytes it was handed,
so a stale binary pinned and verified perfectly; nothing anywhere asked
"were these bytes built from the commit being released?".

The closure has two halves, and these tests bind both:

* every bundled artifact's build embeds a plain-text stamp,
  ``GPUWM_BRIDGE_SOURCE_REV=<40-hex git commit>``, in the binary
  (the same convention as the GPUWM_* attribute literals the renderer
  already carries, which is how the staleness was noticed at all); and
* the release tool's ``pin`` step -- the cut-path choke point every
  bundle passes through before a wheel is built -- extracts that stamp
  from every binary member and refuses a bundle whose stamp is absent,
  unparseable, ambiguous, or names any commit other than the one being
  released.

The check reads bytes, never executes the artifact: it must hold on a
GPU-less runner and against a binary for the other platform.
