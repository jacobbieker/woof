"""Can a physics scheme allocate its working set outside the arena again?

This file is the gate, and it exists because MYNN got all the way to a
production-width timing measurement while allocating **54,595 bytes per
column in 484 pool allocations per step** that no part of the preflight knew
about.  At the 360,000 columns of a d04 nest that is 18,743.8 MiB per step
against an estimate that did not move at all.  The failure mode is not
slowness.  It is that ``run_alloc_preflight`` returns a comfortable headroom
number for a configuration that will run the card out of memory, on hardware
with no ECC, where the observed symptom of running out is corrupted output
rather than an exception.

Five properties are gated, and each one is shown failing before it is shown
passing, because a gate nobody has watched fail is not evidence:

1. **No raw device allocation in a physics GPU module, and no new one
   anywhere.**  That one now lives in
   ``tests/test_physics_allocation_inventory.py``, and it had to move: it
   reads source with :mod:`ast` and opens no device, but ``_carried_hash``
   below imports cupy, and ``conftest`` marks a whole module ``gpu`` when a
   non-test function in it does.  So the ratchet ran only on the card, was
   red there for days, and no ``GPUWM_NO_LOCAL_GPU=1`` run could report it --
   four Noah-MP modules and one RUC function were missing from the inventory
   the entire time.  Do not move it back.
2. **Every slot is write-before-read.**
   :func:`test_poisoning_a_constant_zero_slot_is_visible` shows that
   corrupting a slot that is *not* write-before-read is caught, so the
   poison lever can see a lie, before
   :func:`test_poisoning_the_workspace_leaves_the_forecast_alone` NaN-fills
   every slot that is classified write-before-read and requires the same
   hash.
3. **The chunk boundary is not a seam.**  A carried forecast at several
   chunk widths must produce one identical hash.
4. **The declared workspace does not grow with the domain.**
5. **The registry prices exactly what the solver asks for**, in both
   directions.

    This is the property that lets a launch gate refuse a configuration.  A
    workspace proportional to ``ny * nx`` would price accurately and still not
    fit: at 360,000 columns the old working set was 18.3 GiB of churn on a
    card whose correctness rail is 29,500 MiB total.

    The column chunk is a ceiling, not a fixed width, so the claim is a
    bound: identical for every domain at or above the chunk, and never
    larger below it.  A test that demanded equality with a 64x64 grid would
    be demanding that a 4,096-column domain allocate a full-width workspace,
    which is not the property anyone wants.

    The width is the shipped default rather than anything read off the
    card, so this reads it through the resolver and requires that number:
    the registry, the arena and the solver agree on ONE width, and it is
    the one that was measured.
