"""The streaming mode's contract, on the CPU.

The expensive half of this feature -- that a streamed domain reproduces a
resident one bit for bit -- is proven on a GPU by ``tilestream/test_gate.py``
and ``tilestream/test_join.py``.  What is proven here is everything that must
hold BEFORE a card is involved, and above all the OFF contract: a tree that
configures no ``[tiles]`` must execute the code it executed before this
feature existed, through the same call, with the same identity, and must
fingerprint the same.

The OFF contract is stated as an object identity rather than as a behaviour,
because that is the only form of it that cannot rot.  ``make_stepper`` with
streaming off returns ``woof.core.dycore.step`` ITSELF; a wrapper that
merely forwarded would satisfy every behavioural test and would still be a
second code path to keep correct.
