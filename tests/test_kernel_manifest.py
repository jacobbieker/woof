"""Every compiled site reports the translation unit it actually compiled.

The manifest is only worth carrying if it cannot drift from the compiler call
beside it.  These tests read the tree's own syntax: at each site the arguments
handed to :func:`record_module` must be the *same expressions* handed to the
compiler, so recording a different source, or collapsing the option tuples
into one global flags string, is a syntactic difference a test can see
without a device.

TWO compiler routes are audited, not one.  ``cp.RawModule`` is the common
one; ``cupy.cuda.compiler.compile_using_nvrtc`` is the bypass a site must
take when it needs an option CuPy would otherwise duplicate -- CuPy appends
``-ftz=true`` after the caller's options, NVRTC 13.0 rejects the repeat
outright, and ``woof/core/rrtmg_sw.py`` moved onto the bypass for exactly
that reason.  Auditing only RawModule would have let that site keep
recording an option tuple no compiler was handed.
