"""The host-memory page, held against the decoders it describes.

A user's three-domain ERA5 forecast printed one word -- ``Terminated``
-- and nothing else.  Nothing in the product had priced the cost that
killed it: ``woof check``'s itemization is device memory by its own
label (``IngestMemoryEstimate``, ``woof/core/preflight.py``), and
``docs/public/HARDWARE.md`` sized the card carefully and said nothing at
all about RAM.  So the page now carries a host-memory section, and the
numbers in it are the ones a reader is going to multiply by their own
grid.

Which makes them exactly the kind of number that rots.  ``205 full 2-D
arrays`` is not a fact about ERA5; it is a fact about the retrieval THIS
code asks CDS for -- five pressure-level variables on the 37 standard
levels plus twenty single-level ones -- and it moves the day someone
adds a variable to :func:`woof.fetch.era5_request_template`.  The same
goes for the GFS ladder in :mod:`woof.gfs_direct`.  A page that quotes
a stale inventory is worse than one that quotes none, because a reader
sizes a machine from it.

So every figure the section states is recomputed here from the code that
decides it, and the committed table rows are rebuilt byte for byte.  The
binding is the enumeration kind (``tests/doc_command_parity.py`` names
the two): the code declares a set, the document presents a figure
derived from it, and the two are held against each other.  The command
bindings on the same section -- that its ``woof fetch`` line names a
real door with real flags -- are already covered by
``tests/test_docs_extras_agree_with_code.py``.
