"""The cycle driver's own ``--radar-tten`` lines, run through its door.

``tools/da_cycle_prepared.py`` forces each member on an observed leg whose
analysis is applied: the leg's reflectivity is read once
(``reflectivity_from_document``), each member builds one slot from its own
state at the start of the leg (``background_from_state`` then
``build_tendency``), the slot lasts the leg (``leg_length(leg) / 60``
minutes), the control is never forced, a verification-only leg and a free
leg are never forced, the forcing is detached before the restart set, and a
forcing nobody read stops the run.  These cells run the driver's ``cycle``
over observed legs with the harness of ``tests/test_da_cycle_memory.py``
and read the report the driver writes.

On the CPU legs the radar heating module is stood in by recording fakes, so
what is checked is the driver's sequence; the same door with the real
module, a real state and the real microphysics read is in
``tests/test_radar_tten_cycle_gpu.py``.
