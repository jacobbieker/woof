"""Noah-MP, actually forecasting.

Every other Noah-MP test in this repository measures a routine against an
oracle CSV.  This one runs the model: ``sf_surface_physics=4`` over mixed land
and water, stepped through RK3, and it asserts the things that separate
"ported" from "runs":

* the selector reaches Noah-MP and not Noah, and the census proves it ran on
  land columns rather than skipping every one of them;
* the cold start produces a usable state -- the arrays that
  ``initialize_physics`` allocates at zero are not zero after
  ``NOAHMP_INIT``/``SNOW_INIT``, because ``TV = TG = 0 K`` is not a cold state
  but a state whose saturation vapour pressure is negative;
* the surface fluxes and the soil column actually move, which is what says
  the scheme is coupled rather than merely called;
* nothing goes non-finite;
* a restart round trip reproduces every carried array bit for bit **and** the
  next step from the restored state is bit identical -- with a companion test
  that perturbs one word and proves that comparison can fail; and
* a real wrfout is written and read back, including the snow stack on its own
  vertical axis.

The grid is small on purpose.  Seven of the column's leaves are device-batched
and the rest is still host FP32, about 0.55 ms per land column at width on the
reference card (see ``test_the_column_cost_is_what_the_registry_says``), so a
36-land-column domain is a few tens of milliseconds per LSM call; a 50x20
domain is still minutes.  That cost is the scheme's scaling blocker, it is
published in the registry warnings, and it is why this file does not grow the
grid to make the assertions look better.
