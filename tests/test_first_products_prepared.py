"""The prepared front door arming its OWN early render.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES.  Arming lived on :class:`woof.runplan.RunObserver`
and on ``woof go``, so render-on-first-committed-frame was reachable
only through a HOST.  ``python -m woof.prepared_single_domain_forecast``
-- the documented way to run a prepared bundle -- imported
:mod:`woof.first_products` nowhere and declared no render flag, so it
committed its analysis frame (fsynced, self-validated, renamed) minutes
before the forecast ended with nothing watching.  MEASURED consequence:
reaching an 89 s launch-to-first-plot on that route took an EXTERNAL
process polling the frames for ``GPUWM_WRITE_COMPLETE`` -- a watcher
reimplementing a hook the writer already raises.

Separate from tests/test_first_products.py on purpose.  That module ends
with a module-level ``pytest.importorskip("wrf")`` for its
real-renderer group, which skips the WHOLE file on a box without the
render extra -- including its CPU tests.  These are CPU-only and must
run everywhere the runner does, so they live where nothing can skip
them.
