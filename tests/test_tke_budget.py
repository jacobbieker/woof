# tests/test_tke_budget.py
"""km_opt=2 restart carrier, lateral-boundary arm, and the TKE budget.

Three things land together here because they are three faces of the same
question -- does the prognostic carrier survive every boundary a real run
crosses?

* the RESTART boundary: ``tke`` is a serialized field and ``tke0`` its
  rebuilt time-t copy, so a stop/restore/finish trajectory must reproduce
  the uninterrupted one byte for byte (AC-L5.3);
* the LATERAL boundary: WRF's ``bound_tke`` (every domain, every RK stage)
  and ``flow_dep_bdy`` (specified/nested spec zone) are the entire
  treatment TKE gets, and each is checked with a mutation control that
  FIRES;
* the BUDGET: the term-by-term device accumulation must close against the
  storage it claims to explain, and each term must be essential --
  removing any one of them from the sum has to move the residual by orders
  of magnitude, which is what makes the committed residual a measurement
  rather than an artifact of its own definition (AC-L5.1's bound-free arm).

Formula authority: the byte-identical local WRF v4.6.1 bundle --
dyn_em/module_em.F:2490-2520 (bound_tke), dyn_em/solve_em.F:2432-2451
(call order), share/module_bc.F:2335-2456 (flow_dep_bdy),
Registry/Registry.EM_COMMON:312 (the ``r``-only IO string that makes tke a
restart field with no boundary stream, no nest interpolation, and no
feedback).
