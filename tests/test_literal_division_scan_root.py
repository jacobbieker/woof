"""A193: the literal-division gate reads sources only from the tree it scans.

The breakage this prevents: on the 2.8.1 B200 bench woof was installed
from a wheel beside a source tests tree, and the compiler census
(tools/literal_division_census.py) took p3_device's sources from the
imported package, outside the tree it scanned, and stopped on a ValueError
before compiling a unit: three test_literal_division_gate failures that
were no division defect.  A census or scan reading the imported package
instead of the scanned tree gates sources other than the ones under test.

Here the scanned tree is a copy of this tree's kernels, outside the
imported woof, with a marker appended to every kernel source.  Every unit
the census builds and every offender the scans report must come from that
copy, and no file outside it may be opened.  CPU only; nothing compiles.
