"""Output-integrity findings from the 2.5.0 UX persona walks (N5/N8/N12/N16).

Four defects, each measured through the real front door on the RC and
each reproduced here the same way before it was fixed:

* **N5** -- a FAILED ``woof render`` (nonzero exit, zero PNGs) still
  created the stamped run folder and pointed ``latest-run.txt`` at it,
  so a script following the documented pointer could not tell a failed
  render from a successful empty one.  The folder and the pointer now
  publish only after at least one PNG lands.
* **N8** -- every refusal tail printed ``(run woof <command> --explain
  for the reason)``, and typing exactly that is an argparse usage error
  because ``--explain`` is a modifier that needs the original
  arguments.  The tail now prints the reader's own full invocation with
  ``--explain`` appended, on every door.
* **N12** -- FIRST-LIGHT documents ``--bridge`` as optional and
  self-resolving at the prep door; the measured door exited 64 with
  ``invalid or missing run arguments: --bridge``.  The door now
  resolves it through the same staged-bridge ladder every other bridge
  uses, and refuses by name -- listing what it searched -- only when
  nothing resolves.
* **N16** -- ``woof version`` on a 2.5.0 install said ``PyPI latest is
  2.4.1 -- this install is current.`` and kept advising ``pip install
  --upgrade``.  The ahead-of-PyPI case now has its own sentence and the
  upgrade advice is withheld when it would point backwards.

The doors are driven as subprocesses (``python -m woof.cli``) wherever
the finding is CLI behaviour; ``version`` is driven through the real
dispatch in-process because its index answer must be controlled.
