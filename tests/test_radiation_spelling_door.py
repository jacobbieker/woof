"""One radiation choice, two spellings, one answer at every door.

``ra_physics = N`` means "engine N on both streams" and leaves
``ra_lw_physics``/``ra_sw_physics`` at -1; the split pair states the two
streams and leaves ``ra_physics`` at 0.  ``woof.config
.radiation_scheme_ids`` has admitted both since it was written, and the
WRF namelist importer emits the aggregate for a coupled pair.

The capability door did not: it matched a component option on the RAW
selector keys, and one registry option was keyed on ``(-1, -1)`` -- the
sentinel for "the split pair is not stated here" -- so the aggregate
spelling of ANY radiation choice landed on that one option.  An imported
4/4 configuration therefore matched no option a shipped template
declares and could never equal its own profile, and an imported
radiation-off configuration was refused for not setting
``ra_physics = 4``.  Both run exactly what the split spelling runs.

The shortwave-only refusal is measured here too, beside them, because it
is the OTHER thing a radiation selector pair can be refused for and the
two were reported together: it stands, and this pins the sentence that
makes it stand.
