"""Does the Noah-MP cold start actually launch its CUDA kernel?

``tests/test_noahmp_device_wiring.py`` asks this of the per-timestep column
solver and the answer is yes.  It has never been asked of the **one-time**
cold start, and the answer was no: ``noahmp_cold_start`` ran a Python double
loop over every column of the grid calling
``woof.core.noahmp_driver.noahmp_init_column`` -- 528 lines of pure numpy --
on every ``sf_surface_physics=4`` run this project has ever started, while
``woof/core/noahmp_driver_gpu.py`` and ``kernels/noahmp_driver.cu`` held a
bitwise-verified device port with no production caller.  ``preflight.py``
priced ``noahmp_driver`` into the scheme-4 compile inventory the whole time,
so every Noah-MP run paid to compile a kernel it never launched.

**A timing gate cannot catch this.**  The host loop is correct, merely slow
(18.4-38.8 us per column measured, 6.6-14.0 s at a 360,000-column nest), so
nothing fails -- there is just a start-up cost nobody can attribute.  What
catches it is making the host loop *impossible* to call and requiring a real
cold start to survive anyway:

* :func:`test_the_cold_start_runs_on_the_device_by_default` replaces both host
  cold-start routines with raising tripwires and builds a real Noah-MP
  configuration through ``initialize_physics``.  If a single column were
  initialised on the host the build could not finish.
* :func:`test_the_trap_fires_when_the_device_arm_is_withheld` and
  :func:`test_the_env_override_selects_the_host_cold_start` withhold the
  device arm the two supported ways and require the tripwire to fire, so the
  pass above is evidence rather than a gate that has never been able to fail.
* :func:`test_the_two_cold_start_arms_agree_bit_for_bit` runs both arms over
  five real configurations -- bare ground, a two-layer pack, a three-layer
  pack, the 2000 mm SWE cap and the glacier fill -- and requires byte-for-byte
  equal carriers.  The numpy loop is the paired scalar authority; the device
  arm has to reproduce it exactly, at the same ``max_ulp == 0`` bar
  ``tests/test_noahmp_driver_cuda.py`` holds the kernel to against the WRF
  oracle.
