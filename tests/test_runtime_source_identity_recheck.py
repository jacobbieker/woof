"""A git hiccup must not destroy the receipt of a run that was fine.

``prepared_domain_tree_forecast`` snapshots ``_runtime_source_identity()``
when a forecast starts and compares it again at the very END -- after the
physics, after every frame is written -- so that source edited mid-run
cannot ship under the identity the run started with.  That check is worth
keeping.  What it could not do was tell two different events apart.

Measured 2026-09-02: a four-hour two-domain forecast (``adt4h_dt60``)
completed all 240 outer steps, wrote 62 ``wrfout`` frames, and then died
at the receipt gate on

    RuntimeError: forecast implementation changed during execution

writing ``evidence/failed-run-receipt.json`` instead of a run receipt.
Nothing had changed.  None of the five hashed files was modified, HEAD
had not moved, no commit was made, and creating untracked files was
tested and provably does not move the identity.  By elimination the
``git rev-parse`` at the end of the run failed to run -- and the
``except (FileNotFoundError, CalledProcessError)`` branch answers that
by setting ``commit = None; tree = None``, which a bare ``!=`` cannot
tell from HEAD having genuinely moved.

The cheap event destroyed the expensive one.  On a 72-hour forecast that
is a very expensive way to lose nothing but a git hiccup.

Both halves of the bar are here: a git outage at either end must NOT be
reported as a change, and a HEAD that actually moves must still be.
