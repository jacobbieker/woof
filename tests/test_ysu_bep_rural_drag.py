"""The declared rural-drag divergence of YSU's flag_bep arm (sf_urban_physics 2/3).

THE WRF DEFECT.  Under BEP or BEP+BEM, WRF v4.7.1's YSU
(``phys/physics_mmm/bl_ysu.F90:1311-1314``) keeps ``(1-frc)*fric``, the rural
share of its own surface drag, on the first-level diagonal and removes only
the urban share.  The BEP couple (``module_sf_noahdrv.F:1708-1711``,
``module_sf_noahmpdrv.F:3718-3721``) has already folded the same rural drag,
``(1-frc)*(-ust*ust)/dz8w/|U|``, into ``a_u_bep``/``a_v_bep`` at level 1, and
``bl_ysu.F90:1359-1368`` subtracts ``a_u*dt2`` from that same diagonal.  So
the rural surface drag is applied twice, on every column that is not wholly
urban: the ocean, farmland, parks.  Heat and moisture are counted once (YSU
drops its own flux with ``(1-bepswitch)*hfx`` and takes the rural flux from
``b_t_bep``), and WRF's MYJ path under BEP (``myjurb``'s VDIFV) takes the
surface drag only through ``a_u``, so neither has the defect.

WHAT IT DID TO A FORECAST.  On the 2026-09-29 08Z HRRR cycle at 750 m, BEP
under YSU slowed the 10 m wind over the open Pacific, where there are no
buildings, by 1.25 m/s within two hours off San Francisco (0.34 m/s off Los
Angeles), and rural land winds by 0.3 to 1.8 m/s; the MYJ arm moved the
ocean wind by +0.03 m/s.

WHAT GPUWM DOES.  ``kernels/ysu.cu`` removes the WHOLE of YSU's own
first-level drag under BEP (WRF's line without the ``frc_urb1d`` factor), so
the surface drag enters once, through ``a_u_bep``, the way heat already
enters through ``b_t_bep``.  One expression under ``if constexpr (BEP)``:
``ysu_column`` (urban off) compiles from unchanged statements.  WRF with
exactly that one-line change is the oracle ``tests/test_ysu_bep_wrf471_
parity.py`` grades the port against (``build_ysu_bep_fix.sh``).  Reverting
is one line in each place.

WHAT THIS FILE PINS.  The fixture's rural columns (frc = 0: cases 6, 18 and
24; case 12 has ust = hfx = qfx = 0, where the plain kernel takes its
zero-flux short circuit and the BEP arm cannot, so it drags nothing either
way and is left out) run through the port twice: under BEP with the forcing
the couple hands YSU, and with urban off.  The measure is the column's
momentum budget, ``sum_k du_k * delp_k / g``: the vertical mixing conserves
column momentum, so this is minus the surface stress the solve applied,
whatever the countergradient and diffusion terms did inside the column.

* The fixed arm applies the urban-off stress times the ratio of the two
  spellings of one drag: the couple writes ``ust**2/dz8w/|U|``, YSU writes
  ``ust**2/wspd1*rho*g/delp*(wspd1/wspd)**2``, and on these columns
  (``wspd = |U|``) they differ by ``delp/(rho*g*dz8w)``, YSU's own density
  against the column's layer thickness.  The synthetic fixture's pressure
  column is not built from that density, so the factor is 1.031 to 1.038
  here; in a model state it is the hydrostatic residual.  After dividing it
  out the fixed arm is the urban-off column to within 0.2 percent.
* Stock WRF applies about twice it.
