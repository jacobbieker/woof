"""WP-12b -- the mp=28 validation CAMPAIGN roll-up, and the evidence ratchet.

Every other file in the mp=28 suite gates one thing: a device helper, a
kernel, the adapter's composition, the driver wiring.  This one owns the
properties of the campaign AS A WHOLE, which is where a port quietly rots:

1.  THE G3 RESIDUAL MATRIX IS A RATCHET.  Nineteen committed WRF column
    fixtures times sixteen compared fields.  ``_PUBLISHED_G3`` records what
    every non-zero residual above 2e-6 measured on the tree WP-12b published
    from, and this file fails if ANY of them grows.  That is strictly
    stronger than the pass/fail gate in
    ``tests/test_thompson_aerosol_adapter.py``: a change that moves
    ``aero-nc-sed`` from 1.1e-6 to 1.9e-6 still passes the 2e-6 gate and
    still gets caught here.

2.  THE PUBLISHED EVIDENCE CANNOT DRIFT FROM THE MEASUREMENT.
    ``docs/public/validation/mp28-column-evidence.md`` is the document a user
    will quote back.  Its per-fixture table is recomputed here and compared.
    A fixture that IMPROVES also fails this file, deliberately: an evidence
    document that understates the port is still a document nobody re-read.

3.  NO NEW SILENT SKIP.  Seven silent skips are how two critical defects
    survived wave 2 of this port.  A skipped test is an unmeasured claim
    wearing a green tick.  ``_SKIP_SITES`` is the complete, audited census of
    every place the mp=28 suite can skip, xfail or importorskip, and this
    file fails when one is ADDED as loudly as when one is removed.  The
    census is static (AST over the test sources), so it is deterministic and
    costs no device time.

4.  THE mp=8 FREEZE IS RE-ASSERTED AT THIS PACKAGE'S TIP.  MP28_PORT_SPEC.md
    makes the WP-00 receipt the merge criterion for WP-12, "re-run at the tip
    of every package branch".  This is that re-run.

5.  CCN_ACTIVATE.BIN SHIPS, AND STAYS OUT OF THE CLASSIC SET.  Port HARD
    RULE 5 was "stays unvendored"; the owner reversed that on 2026-08-01
    once WRF's public-domain dedication was checked.  The assertion is
    inverted rather than dropped, and is still made from inside the campaign
    file, because both directions are invariants whose violation would be
    invisible in a passing test suite and fatal at release: an unshipped
    table breaks mp=28 for every user, and a table inside
    CLASSIC_TABLE_ASSETS breaks mp=8.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1.  The G3 residual matrix, pinned.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: MEASURED on an RTX 5090 (CUDA 12, cupy 14.1.1, nvrtc defaults) by
#: WP-12c, from a full re-drive of the shipped adapter over every fixture in
#: ``woof/data/thompson/oracle-aero/``.  ONLY the residuals that exceed
#: :data:`G3_GATE` are listed; every other (fixture, field) cell of the
#: 22 x 16 matrix is at or below it and is covered by
#: :data:`_G3_CLEAN_FIXTURES` and by the adapter's own gate.
#:
#: These are UPPER BOUNDS, not expected values.  The assertion is
#: ``measured <= published * 1.05``.  Nothing here is a tolerance in the
#: sense of "how close is close enough"; the tolerance is G3_GATE and these
#: are the accurate, published distances from it.
#:
#: WHAT MOVED IN WP-13, ALL RE-MEASURED HERE:
#:   * WP-13a restored WRF's LEVEL-WISE working rain density for sedimentation
#:     (module_mp_thompson.F:3237-3238 from the :3193 TAU+1 density everywhere,
#:     :3568-3570 from the :3490 post-condensation density only inside the
#:     :3501-3502 gate; woof/core/kernels/thompson_aerosol_sat.cu wrote the
#:     post-condensation one unconditionally).  ``aero-drop-evap`` and
#:     ``aero-ice-demott-idxin`` LEFT this table completely;
#:     ``aero-cloud-freeze-nc`` lost qr, nr_per_kg and rainnc_mm and kept only
#:     qc; ``aero-reduces-to-classic`` went qr 7.813e-05 -> 1.788e-07 (inside
#:     the gate, so it is gone) and nr_per_kg 4.832e-05 -> 5.700e-06.
#:   * WP-13b pinned the contraction of the source networks' terminal
#:     multiply-add (WRF's :3973-4023 `q1d + qten*DT`, which the gfortran -O2
#:     oracle cannot fuse and nvrtc did).  ``aero-nc-cap``'s qc and nc and
#:     ``aero-ice-demott-idxin``'s surface accumulators became BITWISE exact.
#:   * ONE CELL GREW AND IS PUBLISHED AS GROWN: ``aero-cold-overlap`` qr
#:     3.6666e-05 -> 4.4426e-05.  Bisected to the cold network's own qr apply;
#:     reverting that single pin restores the old number and simultaneously
#:     un-does four aero-ice-demott-idxin improvements, two of them exact.  In
#:     the units the adapter's _RESIDUAL_ATTRIBUTION records this cell at --
#:     ulps of the entry value, because 99.5% of the level's rain is consumed
#:     in the step -- it moved 1.477 -> 1.789 ulp.
#:
#: WHAT MOVED IN THE PUBLICATION BEFORE:
#:   * ``aero-ice-koop`` LEFT the table.  ni 1.764e-03 / qi 1.612e-03 /
#:     effi 5.093e-05 -- what three auditors called the port's largest genuine
#:     physics gap -- now measure 3.396e-07 / 1.534e-07 / 1.886e-07, inside
#:     the gate.  WP-06 closed it.
#:   * ``aero-cold-overlap`` GAINED qc 1.000e+00, nc_per_kg 1.000e+00 and
#:     effc_m 8.102e-01 at 0-based level 4.  MEASURED: WRF ends the step there
#:     with qc = 1.4551915228366852e-11 kg/kg -- exactly 2**-36, and exactly
#:     ONE float32 ulp of the 2.325216e-04 kg/kg the level entered with -- and
#:     nc = 1.833336 per kg, while woof ends at exactly zero, so the relative
#:     metric reports 1.0 on an absolute difference of one ulp.  Recorded as a
#:     MISS, not allowanced.  See the attribution note on
#:     ``tests/test_thompson_aerosol_adapter.py::_G3_RESIDUALS`` for what is
#:     and is not claimed about where the change came from.
#:   * three WP-08 sedimentation columns joined the deck; ``wp08-freeze`` and
#:     ``wp08-nusweep`` carried residuals 1.4x and 2.3x the gate.
#:   * ``wp08-freeze`` LEFT the table when the rain fallout was handed WRF's
#:     L_qr (nr 2.7239e-06 -> 4.006e-07 at level 0 on the RTX 4090 and the
#:     RTX 5090; 8.012e-08 on the host build of the kernels).
#:   * ``aero-cloud-freeze-nc``'s effc_m and ``aero-ice-demott-idxin``'s qc
#:     fell inside the gate and left the table.

#: worth being exact about why, because this file used to name it as the
#: standing example of the two files disagreeing: this file applies the FLAT
#: gate and never honoured the adapter's ``_END_TO_END_BOUNDS`` carve-out,
#: so it kept the fixture out while the adapter counted it clean.  The
#: carve-out is now RETIRED -- the merge inherited the mp=8 lane's two
#: sedimentation reconciliations and level 5's nr_per_kg went 5.7005e-06 to
#: 4.146e-07 -- so both files agree on it for the first time, at the flat
#: gate, with nothing carved out.

    sedimentation density; ``aero-ice-koop`` joined earlier, when WP-06 closed
    the homogeneous-haze-freezing rate gap.

    WHAT THIS FILE'S GATE IS, EXACTLY, BECAUSE IT IS NOT THE STRICTEST ONE IN
    THE PORT AND USED TO SAY IT WAS.  It is the flat 2.0e-06 applied to the
    SIXTEEN-field matrix ``_g3_matrix`` measures -- the 15 prognostic columns
    plus ``rainnc_mm``.  Two consequences, both stated rather than implied:

      * it does NOT honour the adapter's ``_END_TO_END_BOUNDS`` carve-out.
        That USED TO BE the reason ``aero-reduces-to-classic`` was counted
        MISSING here while the adapter's own gate passed it.  The 1.4.1
        merge retired that carve-out -- the inherited mp=8 sedimentation
        reconciliations took its level 5 from 5.700e-06 to 4.146e-07 -- so
        the two gates now agree on the fixture and it is counted clean HERE
        while the adapter's UNEXCEPTIONED table still reports it missing,
        which is the opposite asymmetry and comes from the second bullet;
      * it DOES inherit the adapter's ``_NEAR_CANCELLATION_LEVELS`` exclusion,
        because ``_run_g3`` applies it in both modes.  ``aero-reduces-to-
        classic``'s 0-based level 6 is therefore out of the qr and nr numbers
        in :data:`_PUBLISHED_G3` -- which is why its qr row reads 1.788e-07
        rather than the 3.155e-03 the adapter's UNEXCEPTIONED table reports.
        That level is not unmeasured: it is bounded in ulps of the entry value
        by ``tests/test_thompson_aerosol_adapter.py::
        test_the_near_cancellation_level_is_bounded_in_ulps_not_excluded``
        and published in ULP terms by the same file's
        ``test_every_g3_residual_is_published_in_ulps_as_well_as_relative``.

    The genuinely unexceptioned count -- 23 quantities, no exclusion, no
    carve-out -- is 18 of 22, and is pinned in the adapter file by
    ``test_the_unexceptioned_g3_table_is_printed_and_its_count_pinned``.  The
    two counts USED TO coincide and no longer do: 19 here, 18 there.  They
    were always DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS asserted separately on purpose, and
    the divergence is the level-6 exclusion this file inherits and that one
    does not.
