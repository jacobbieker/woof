"""The engine's library warnings reach the page, while the run goes and after it ends.

The defect: a library the run drives can warn and let the run go on as
configured (a warm bubble of 15 K, above 10 K, replaces the analysis near its
centre rather than nudging it). The run's events.jsonl carried the warning,
but the page kept only the missing-basemap warning, so neither the live map
nor the map reopened after the run said anything about it.
