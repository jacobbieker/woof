"""The mp_physics=8 freeze gate -- WP-00 of the mp_physics=28 port.

This was the merge criterion for every other package on the
``feature/mp28-thompson-aerosol-aware`` branch.  The port is landed and
shipped; what the file guards from now on is stated under RE-FROZEN
2026-09-17 below, and ``tools/release/precut_gpu_gate.py`` runs it on the
release node before every cut.

WHAT IT PROVES, AND WHY THAT IS ENOUGH
--------------------------------------
The mp=8 non-regression argument is a MECHANISM, not a measurement.
``woof/core/kernels/__init__.py::load_module`` builds exactly one
``cupy.RawModule`` per ``.cu`` file from a single source string.  If that
string is byte-identical then the PTX is identical, therefore the register
allocation and FP contraction are identical, therefore every mp=8 result is
bit-identical.  No PTX-diff tooling is needed, and none should be relied on:
a PTX gate is a test that fails late and can be "fixed" by relaxing it.

So the primary assertion here is a digest of the *assembled* source string
-- captured by driving the REAL loader with a recording ``RawModule``, not
by re-implementing it -- for every ``.cu`` translation unit that existed at
the frozen commit.  That catches an edit to ``thompson.cu``, an edit to
``common.cuh``, a change to ``CUDA_DEFINES``, a change to ``_preamble()``,
and any loader change that is not perfectly inert.  WP-02's
``_EXTRA_HEADERS`` allow-list is exactly such a change, and this gate is
what holds it to its inertness claim.

Around the mechanism sit six receipts (R1..R6), each a real failure mode
that would otherwise produce a model that runs, stays stable and is
silently wrong -- the specific hazard of this port, where a half-converted
prognostic ``nc`` never raises anything.

R1  source identity of thompson.cu / thompson.py / every frozen module.
R2  the classic table contract (CCN_ACTIVATE.BIN must never appear in it).
R3  ``extra_moist_species`` -- Morrison's deliberate ``nc`` exclusion.
R4  the preflight allocation and scratch-arena surface.
R5  the nest-transition edge field codes (28 APPENDED, never inserted).
R6  ``acoustic`` n_mass selection plus the recorded ``_apply_thompson``
    launcher call graph, argument by argument.

Plus two fixture receipts: F1 freezes the 92 committed mp=8 oracle CSVs,
and F2 pins the four-file clean-rebuild exception together with a hermetic
witness for its cause (see :mod:`tools.mp8_freeze_receipt`).

New mp=28 files are expected and permitted everywhere: the gate pins what
existed and ignores additions.  It never passes because something was
deleted -- every pinned name must still be present.

RE-FROZEN 2026-09-17 (lane/2.7.6-pin-gates), AND WHAT A RED DIGEST MEANS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The mp=28 port is landed and shipped, so "mp=28 has not touched mp=8" is
no longer a merge criterion anyone waits on.  What the digests still
catch is an edit to an mp=8 unit that ships without a reading of what it
did to mp=8 results.  4ae7913df (fix(mp8): preserve rain concentration
and condensation history, in 2.7.4) is the case in point: it edited
thompson.cu, thompson.py and the adapter's launcher arguments, shipped
its reading (quoted below), and did NOT re-freeze here, so seven
assertions in this file were red on the 2.7.4 tip 7417342a8 and the
2.7.5 tip c36f4c1f1 while the release contract set, which runs no GPU
pin, never ran them.  Confirmed on a development machine at fc639c51f: 7 failed, 14
passed, 1 skipped.  tools/release/precut_gpu_gate.py now runs this file
before a cut.

Decision per assertion, under the gate law (a gate names the concrete
breakage it prevents) and the retire-its-guards law:

* KEPT, re-frozen at 4ae7913df with its reading: the thompson.cu file
  digest, the assembled compile-string digest, the 65-module digest
  table, the thompson.py digest and launch inventory, the constant-Nt_c
  site inventory (all R1) and the recorded launcher call graph (R6).
  The breakage each prevents from now on: an mp=8 result change shipped
  with no reading.  A red digest therefore means "a frozen unit was
  edited by a commit that shipped no reading of its own": the fixer
  records one (a fixture, a test and a page, as 4ae7913df did) and
  re-freezes here citing it.  Each failure text says so.
* KEPT unchanged, their breakage still exists and is named in each
  docstring: the preamble / common.cuh / CUDA_DEFINES pins (a constant
  change moves every scheme silently), the loader inertness check, R2
  the classic table contract, R3 extra_moist_species, R4 the allocation
  surface and the scratch arena aliasing contract, R5 the edge field
  codes, R6 n_mass, F1 the 92 oracle CSVs, F2 the four-file rebuild
  exception and its inverted witness.
* RETIRED: none.  Every assertion names a breakage still possible.

THE READING 4ae7913df SHIPPED, quoted from its fixture, test and page.
tests/fixtures/thompson-active-collision.json holds three complete
classic column calls (saturated, subsaturated, supersaturated: 274.15 K,
80000 Pa, qc 0.001, qr 0.0003, qs 0.0002, qg 0.0002 kg/kg, nr 30000/kg,
dt 10 s) generated through the pinned WRF v4.6.1 driver at
d66e442fccc04111067e29274c9f9eaccc3cef28 by
tools/thompson_wrf461_oracle/active_collision_fixture.py.  After one
call the saturated column's lowest level goes qr 3.000e-04 to 3.331e-04,
nr 30000 to 30450.35, qc 1.000e-03 to 9.525e-04, theta 292.1977 to
292.1955 K, with surface rainncv 0.025264 mm, snowncv 0.004562 mm and
graupelncv 0.011440 mm; the subsaturated column, where rain evaporation
runs, goes qr 3.000e-04 to 2.968e-04, nr 30000 to 29332.79, qc 1.000e-03
to 4.002e-04, theta 292.1977 to 290.7510 K, rainncv 0.023742 mm; the
supersaturated column goes qr to 3.331e-04, nr to 30450.46, qc to
1.218e-03, theta to 292.8959 K, rainncv 0.025276 mm.
tests/test_thompson_active_collision.py holds the CUDA adapter to those
columns at rtol 1e-5 and atol 3e-11 on the mass fields, rtol 1e-5 and
atol 0.03 on the number fields, 2 ULP of the field on theta and rtol
1e-5, atol 5e-8 on the surface totals, on both the output-due and the
ordinary route, and pins the two mechanisms directly: the rain density
formed before cloud adjustment is refreshed only when evaporation runs
(rho against 0.99 rho at rtol 3e-7), and a positive condensation marker
leaves rain, number, temperature and vapour bit-identical through the
same-call evaporation.  docs/thompson-active-collision-accounting.md
records the source-stage ledger residual of about -9.13 and -10.27 J/kg
for the two ten-second source cases, present in the reference too, and
that warm and cold collision arithmetic and the canonical tables are
unchanged.  The CHANGELOG 2.7.4 entry is the one-line form.

RE-FROZEN 2026-09-24 by the WRF v4.6.1 real-column repairs, and the
reading they shipped.  thompson.cu, thompson.py and _apply_thompson moved
in thirteen commits (ce303c3e5, 217e84e18, 3c1b51317, 08f1f9373,
6bd61312c, c4f3fcc70, 4d6e551ef, e39adb262, 8a504a23a, a9b054c2a,
9298324cc, 3b57369fe, 7727fda3c), each a WRF v4.6.1 rule the classic
port did not follow, cited to module_mp_thompson.F in the kernel.  The
reading is tools/thompson_real_column_parity --mp 8, which runs WRF's own
Fortran beside the port's kernels compiled for the host on 137,200
columns of seven saved real-data states: before the repairs 54,390
(forecast) and 35,290 (analysis) process-rate cells and 100,744 and
58,594 final-state cells differed from WRF beyond 1e-2 unexplained by
rounding, and the echo by up to 43.9 dB; after them no rate does except
the two rounding decides, 1 and 6 final-state cells do (rounding
residues), and the echo is within 0.045 dB.  The committed classic
fixture tests/data/thompson_real_columns_wrf461_mp8.npz holds that in
tests/test_thompson_real_column_host_parity.py (no rate and no
final-state quantity beyond 1e-2 unexplained, echo within 0.05 dB, exit
temperature within 1e-5).  The 92 classic oracle CSVs (F1) are unchanged;
tools/thompson_real_column_parity/README.md and
docs/public/validation/mp28-column-evidence.md say what closed and what
remains.

This module does not import cupy in its own source and opens no device: the
loader capture replaces ``cupy.RawModule`` with a recorder before any
compile can happen.

# ==========================================================================
# PINS.  RE-ANCHORED at the 1.4.1 merge, and the rule is unchanged: nothing
# on this branch may move a value below, and a diff that has to edit this
# file has by definition changed mp=8.
#
# The pins were captured from an orphan snapshot of ArWen 1.3.1
# (789f61181fb0b198ace10775f3ea184eb5e786a3), the last tree before any
# mp_physics=28 work.  That tree is 371 commits behind the release line the
# port now sits on, and ten of the pinned kernels moved on that line while
# the port was off it: eight noahmp_* translation units, rrtmg_sw, and
# thompson itself, the last by 5e4af4e3 ("the rain MVD bound belongs to
# TAU+1") and cb765336 ("the rain-presence gate is a mass concentration").
# SCRATCH_SLOT_REGISTRY_MP8 gained physics_validation_status the same way.
#
# Re-pinning a freeze is exactly how a freeze gets defeated, so the new
# values were not taken on trust.  Every one of the ten was verified to be
# BYTE-IDENTICAL to integration/release-1.4.1 -- `git show
# integration/release-1.4.1:woof/core/kernels/<name>.cu | sha256sum`
# equals `git show HEAD:...` for all ten -- before its digest was written
# here.  The compiled-string digests are safe for the same reason at one
# remove: PREAMBLE_SHA256 and COMMON_CUH_SHA256 below did NOT move, and
# kernels/__init__._EXTRA_HEADERS lists only the six mp=28 translation
# units, so _extra_header_text() returns "" for every frozen module and
# their assembled sources are still exactly _preamble() + source.
#
# The freeze therefore still asserts what it always asserted: mp=28 has not
# touched mp=8.  What it no longer asserts is that mp=8 never changes --
# it does, on its own line, in its own commits, and this branch inherits
# those by merging rather than by editing.

        # ruc_soil_layer_depth, and therefore invisible to the macro sweep
        # above, which was looking for extents.  Harmless while nine was the
        # only geometry; at six it divides by 0.01 where the grid says 0.05,

        # WHY THIS ROW MAY MOVE FOR IT.  At nine levels
        # ruc_soil_layer_depth[1] IS 0.01f and [0] IS 0.00f, so the
        # subtraction, the divide and every number downstream are unchanged,

        # 43-field host/device driver comparison in
        # tests/test_ruc_nzs_device.py is max_ulp 0 at nine, over snow-free,

    """THE WITNESS, INVERTED, BECAUSE THE DEFECT IT WITNESSED WAS FIXED.

    This test used to be called
    ``test_the_three_original_fixtures_carry_a_foreign_pressure_profile``
    and it asserted the DEFECT: that the 46 committed column fixtures split
    into two ``p_pa`` profiles, 43 against {warm, mixed, ice}.  That was a
    true and carefully measured statement about a stale oracle, and the
    receipt beside it explained the split as a build-provenance difference
    -- "a different libm expf, i.e. a different machine or glibc" -- and
    recorded it rather than repairing it.

    The Thompson oracle lane found the actual mechanism and repaired it.
    It is not a different machine: from GCC 12 on, ``-O2`` implies
    ``-ftree-vectorize``, a vectorised ``exp``/``pow`` loop links glibc's
    libmvec SIMD entry points instead of the scalar routines, libmvec is
    not bit-identical to scalar libm, and whether any given loop vectorises
    is a cost-model decision that depends on how much UNRELATED source
    surrounds it.  ``run_column.F90`` was 227 lines when warm/mixed/ice
    were generated and roughly a thousand when the other 43 were, so the
    same ``-O2`` produced two different oracles.  ``build.sh`` now pins
    ``-fno-tree-vectorize``, which removes libmvec from the link entirely
    and makes the set invariant across gfortran 12/13/14/15 at -O1/-O2/-O3,
    and all five affected fixtures were regenerated
    (fix/thompson-oracle-devectorized, 576b755b and 8290189d).

    So the assertion INVERTS rather than being deleted: ONE profile, 46
    files, no minority group.  That is strictly stronger than what it
    asserted before, and a regression that reintroduces a second profile
    fails here exactly as the old form would have.

    The old docstring's remaining content is preserved because it is still
    the correction of record for the port spec's blocking unknown #2:

    HERMETIC witness for the CAUSE of the (former) exception.

    ``p_pa = p0 * exp(-z(k)/8000.0)`` (run_column.F90:219) is a pure
    function of the harness's own z grid and does not depend on the
    scenario, so all 46 committed column fixtures must print the same 24
    values.  They do not: there are exactly two profiles, and the minority
    one belongs to exactly {warm, mixed, ice} -- which
    ``woof/data/thompson/PROVENANCE.md`` records as the first three columns
    ever generated.  Those three came from a different build of the harness
    (a different libm ``expf``: they differ by one float32 ulp at 13 of 24
    levels), and every other difference in those files -- including the
    ``after`` rows and mixed-surface's rainnc -- follows from it through the
    nonlinear scheme.

    This CORRECTS the port spec's blocking unknown #2, which described the
    drift as a float32-vs-float64 vapour seed with "p_pa, pii and theta
    byte-identical".  p_pa and pii are NOT byte-identical, and the k=1
    vapour coincidence the spec generalised from does not hold at k=2..24.

    Reading only committed repository bytes, this test needs no gfortran,
    no WRF tree and no rebuild -- so the exception stays verified on every
    run instead of resting on a note.
