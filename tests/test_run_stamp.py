"""One run, one folder -- the level above the render layout.

The defect, reported by the collaborator who runs WOOF inside his own
pipeline: he runs the same configuration repeatedly and every run wrote
into the same directory as the one before it.  A second render dropped
its PNGs among the first's; worse, the run artifacts -- ``wrfout``,
``report.json``, ``progress.jsonl``, the stage receipts -- interleaved
in one tree, and the create-only refusals standing in front of THAT
turned "run it again" into "invent a directory name by hand, every
time".

The remedy is a run-stamped level at the case root, above everything a
run writes, and it EXTENDS the 2026-08-06 project ruling rather than
replacing any of it: ``<domain>/<product>/<valid-day>`` survives
underneath, in the same order, from the same module.

    <out>/<run-stamp>/<domain>/<product>/<valid-day>/<file>.png
    <out>/<run-stamp>/run/wrfout/..., report.json, receipts

These tests pin what a script may rely on:

* the stamp's grammar, exactly, and that it is a pure function of
  (launch instant, initialisation time) with a collision ordinal that
  cannot hand two runs one folder;
* that it is the DEFAULT at all three front doors -- ``go``, ``sim``,
  ``render`` -- with ``--run-stamp off`` as the documented workaround;
* that two back-to-back runs of one configuration land in two folders
  and the first run's files are still exactly where and what they were;
* that pointing a door at an existing run folder -- or at anything
  INSIDE one, which is the shape ``woof go`` hands its own render
  stage -- is honoured verbatim, with each door's own answer to what
  happens next: ``go``/``sim`` refuse (create-only stages), ``render``
  resumes;
* that the render layout underneath is unchanged.
