"""A sub-250 m child is told which regime it is in, before it runs.

WHAT BREAKAGE THIS PINS (gate law).  ``_derive_child_run_config`` copies
the parent's physics VERBATIM, so a child derived at any spacing at all
carries the parent's ``bl_pbl_physics`` and ``km_opt`` down with it, and
a child that names no ladder of its own runs on the parent's.  At 83 m
that is a different regime from the mesoscale run the parent's
configuration was written for, and the only place the tree said so was
inside ``--child-levels``' own help -- read by people who already knew to
look for the flag.  The walked outcome: a 798 x 798 child at 83.33 m on
its parent's 49 levels grew w_max from 1.1 m/s to 23.0 m/s over 45
minutes of forecast and went non-finite, 49 minutes of a reader's time
after the plan resolved, with nothing said beforehand.

This is a STATEMENT and not a refusal: the shipped nested LES child is
itself a 250 m child on its grandparent's ladder, and nothing here
changes what any run does.
