"""A downscale review approves the settings it was asked about, never an edit made while it ran.

The defect: Review recorded the form as it stood when the engine's answer
came back, not as it was sent.  Picking 4 times finer while a review of 3
times finer was running bound the ratio-3 answer to the ratio-4 form, so
Start was enabled and the page said "This is the grid Start runs" over a
grid it had never planned.  Start must stay off and the page must ask for a
new review until the edited settings have their own.

The shipped downscale panel runs in headless Chrome (or Edge) inside the real
page server's page; its requests to the downscale route are answered by the
test, so no engine runs.
