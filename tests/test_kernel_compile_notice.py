"""The first-run kernel-compile notice fires cold and stays quiet warm.

The first GPU forecast on a machine pays ~100 s of NVRTC compilation
(measured on the first cross-architecture field run of the published
wheel) under a progress status that never mentioned it.  The notice
module answers "is that about to happen?" from CuPy's on-disk kernel
cache alone -- no CUDA import -- so these tests run everywhere.

The architecture half of this file pins the defect the 2026-08-16
pre-sim profiling audit measured: this box's cache held 7,164 sm_120
entries when its 5090 was swapped for a 3080, so the cache was not
empty, the notice never fired, and 51 s of sm_86 recompilation ran
silently inside step 1's wall clock.
