"""The provenance policy at the shared config load, proven through it.

``tests/test_provenance_gate.py`` proves the gate's verdicts against
real install shapes.  This file proves the WIRING: that the verdicts
fire from inside ``woof.experiment.build_experiment`` -- the one load
every front door shares, the same seam the nocturnal-radiation guard
uses -- so a door nobody remembered to wire still inherits the policy.
Every test here goes through ``build_experiment`` itself; a test that
called the gate directly would stay green with the seam call deleted,
which is exactly the mutation this file exists to catch.

The policy, in full:

* REFUSE only a VERSION DISAGREEMENT -- distribution metadata naming
  one release while the code's own ``pyproject.toml`` declares another,
  in either direction.  That is the "plots say 1.6.2 while 1.8.7
  executes" shape.
* WARN, one line, non-fatal, on a BORROWED version -- metadata resolved
  by name against a distribution that does not provide the executing
  code, digits agreeing.  That is every worktree beside an editable
  install (260 on the reference box); a refusal here bricks
  development, so the warning test asserts the load SUCCEEDS as hard as
  it asserts the line appears.  The line names which install the number
  came from.
* A wheel, and an idealized load (no ``[projection]``): silence.

Install shapes are the real-file builders from the gate's own suite --
a real ``.dist-info`` read by a real ``PathDistribution``, a real
``git init`` -- injected by monkeypatching ``provenance_gate.resolve``,
which is the seam's only source of provenance.
