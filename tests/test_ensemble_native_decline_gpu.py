"""A source-audit drift in the native member pack declines to the ordinary runner.

The native pack rewrites CUDA text and the Python source of stock physics
calls under counted source audits. The audits run while a pack prepares its
launches, after the run was admitted. A drift there used to end an admitted
run as a failure ("no retry is permitted") although no member had advanced.

This gate drives the real session and its automatic native path on a card,
which no other shipped test does, in two arms over the same real inputs:

* unchanged sources: the members run as one native pack, and the run's step
  log says what the pack advanced (it used to close with "0 steps");
* one audited kernel line spelled differently: the real audit refuses, the
  session declines with the audit's own sentence as its named reason, every
  member runs through the ordinary runner, and the products are the same
  bytes the native pack wrote.
