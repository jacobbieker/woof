"""A build error must never wear a data error's face.

Measured 2026-08-20 in a fresh worktree whose Rust bridge had never been
built.  ``woof check --alloc CONFIG`` reaches the ERA5 GRIB1 route,
which builds ``tools/grib1_bridge`` with cargo on first use.  With the
crate's ``gpuwm_preprocess_cpu.dll`` held open by another process --
another lane's run, an editor, a previous woof still exiting -- cargo
cannot relink and fails::

    error: failed to remove file `...\\target\\release\\gpuwm_preprocess_cpu.dll`
    Caused by:
      The process cannot access the file because it is being used by
      another process. (os error 32)

Three things were wrong with what the reader then saw.

1. The sentence was ``could not decode/merge forcing inputs:`` followed
   by ten lines of unrelated Rust compiler WARNINGS, with the one line
   that names the cause last.  Nothing said "this is a build, not your
   data".
2. Five more failures followed, all of them false -- ``forcing
   inventory is missing [22 fields]``, ``forcing has no pressure
   levels`` -- measured against an EMPTY catalog because the decoder
   never ran.  A reader hunting a missing variable is hunting nothing.
3. In ``--json`` mode the whole report goes to stderr and stdout carries
   the memory document, which is written only if the input preflight
   returned zero.  So a caller running ``woof check --alloc --json``
   got an EMPTY stdout and a ``json.loads`` exception: a build error
   reaching a program as a corrupt reply.

Each of the three is guarded below.
