"""A preparation's wait for the leads an as-posted fetch publishes (A136 L3).

:class:`woof.ingest.boundary_stream.PostedLeads` waits for the fetch
loop's per-lead markers (``posting/fNNN.json``), says the wait on the
producer heartbeat as ``waiting_for_source`` with the lead's scheduled and
late times, and ends only on the fetch's own verdict: ``failed.json``
(``source_behind`` is exit 75 naming the lead) or a fetch that ended
without the lead.  Whether a host answered 404, 403 or nothing at all is
the fetch loop's business, so no host answer can fail a preparation.

CPU only; no device, no source data.
