"""Initializing a run from a GFS FORECAST LEAD, not only from f000.

The defect these cover: ``rw-wps --source gfs`` refused any experiment
whose ``start_time`` was not the cycle itself, so a user who wanted the
f174..f240 window had to integrate 240 hours to reach it.  There is no
product reason for that -- a GFS f174 instantaneous record has the same
shape as an f000 one, and WPS/real initializes from forecast leads
routinely -- so ``start_time = cycle + K`` is admitted for any K the
fetched series carries, with one warning line and accurate receipts.

Two hour vocabularies appear throughout and are never interchanged:
SOURCE leads (f000, f018, f174) name NOAA products, and MODEL forcing
offsets (0, 3, 6) count from ``start_time``.  They coincide exactly when
the lead is zero, which is why a lead-zero run is unchanged.
