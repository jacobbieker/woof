"""A forecast's page says where its preparation is while it prepares.

The breakage: from the download to the first model step, the run page and the
list said only "Preparing the grid · forecast hour 0 of 15 · 12 / 3 / 1 km"
and nothing moved for minutes, although the engine was downloading, reading
the starting data, building each grid's start state and writing boundary
times.  Each test replays a real run's recorded events (tests/data/
gui-prep-progress, trimmed from runs on the a development machine page) or records written
by the engine's own step reporters, into a live run folder, and reads what
the page server says about it; the last ones draw the words with the page's
own script.
