"""The prepared cache's SOLVED soil, from the writer to physics setup.

A prepared cache stores the canonical Noah surface it solved, and the
writer therefore drops the native ``SOILT``/``SOILW`` pair from the met
contract stored beside it -- the surface IS the soil statement of a
portable cache.  Every consumer of a restore has to consume that
surface; one that re-derives instead is asking for ingredients the
writer deliberately did not keep.

MEASURED 2026-08-18, Linux shakeout, the benchmark's ``--prepared-cache``
restore arm::

    File "woof/ingest/soil.py", line 197, in _require_same_shape
      raise KeyError(f"missing soil input field(s): {missing}")
    KeyError: "missing soil input field(s): ['ST000007', 'ST007028',
     'ST028100', 'ST100289', 'SM000007', 'SM007028', 'SM028100',
     'SM100289']"

Those ERA5-named layers were never in a native HRRR met snapshot at all;
they are what the soil router asks for once it finds no native pair and
no mapped or GFS markers.  The solved soil was in ``surface/`` the whole
time.

These tests are writer-to-reader: the cache is written by the shipped
writer and read back by the shipped reader, so the "which fields
survive" contract cannot drift into a fixture that agrees with itself.
