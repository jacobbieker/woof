"""Which kernel owns which line of ``cumastrn``, and which lines nobody owns.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The fifth failure in this port was `cumastrn:566-568`
flipping `ktype` between `cuascn` and the closure, two points that look
adjacent, with a promotion rule sitting between them, invisible until a
capture file came back empty. That was fixed at the FIXTURE level by
capturing where each routine reads.

The identical blindness exists at the KERNEL level: a line of `cumastrn`
that falls between two stages is owned by nobody, and nothing looks for it.
There is no equivalent accident waiting to surface it. So the unowned set is
computed here rather than remembered (finding: review).

It also carries a forward obligation. Several class-2 excuses in
``test_ntiedtke_aliasing_audit.py`` are justified by a property of the
reference's CALL SITE: "cumastrn zeroes these four immediately before the
call". That property is only inherited by the port if the port reproduces
that call site. :func:`unowned_ranges` is what makes such an excuse carry a
visible debt until a kernel claims the range it depends on.
