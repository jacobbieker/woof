"""New forecast's Physics step starts every set the engine's check says runs (create.js, run in Node).

The step used to start a picked set only when it was one of the data source's named sets: of 80 two-pick GFS
mixes the check ran 63 and the page could start 5, with Next held off under "Runs." for the rest.  A set that
runs is startable now; the named set it makes, when the source offers one, is what goes into the plan by name.

create.js is loaded as the module the browser loads, with each page module it imports replaced by a stub that
exports the same names, so only its own code runs.
