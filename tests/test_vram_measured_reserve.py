"""The fit gate's grid-independent terms, against what they measure as.

Task 206.  Four separate defects, each pinned by its own test and each
named by the breakage it caused:

1. THE NON-POOL TERM WAS CHARGED TWICE.  The wizard compares the affine
   machine-peak ENVELOPE -- which already carries the CUDA context and
   the local-memory backing store -- against a budget that had the very
   same bytes subtracted from free VRAM a second time by the allocation
   reserve.  On a 10 GiB RTX 3080 that spent 2.91 GiB of a 10 GiB card
   twice over, and refused the smallest layout the hrrr ladder has.

2. A PRESENT CARD WAS PRICED ON AN ABSENT ONE'S PROFILE.  The wizard
   MEASURES the local card's capacity and then prices its kernel
   backing store against the 170-SM reference profile.  A 68-SM 3080
   was charged 2.5x its own reservation -- 1.49 GiB -- while
   ``woof check`` on the same machine used the live profile, so the
   two doors disagreed about the same bytes.

3. THE LINUX ENVELOPE CHARGED NO POOL SLACK.  Fifteen instrumented
   whole forecasts on two Linux cards held 1.17-1.19x the itemized
   estimate in the CuPy pool, and the Linux envelope under-predicted
   every one of them by 0.39-0.74 GiB.  The 2026-08-19 WDDM calibration
   had already flagged this and asked for the measurement; this is it.

4. THE CUDA-CONTEXT CONSTANT WAS ONE CARD'S READING.  432 MiB, taken on
   a 5090 in 2026-07, over-charged a 5070 Ti by 48 MiB and UNDER-charged
   a 5090 by 215 MiB at run time.
