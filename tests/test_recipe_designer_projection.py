"""The recipe designer projects a recipe's disk the way the engine does for the run the page starts.

Breakage these prevent: once the render choice became a required argument
of disk_budget.projected_run_bytes, the recipe designer still called it
without one, so every projection it makes (the disk figure of each recipe
row, the output intervals it picks per card, the words of each row's disk
basis) raised TypeError and no seed recipe could be designed or rebuilt.
No test called the designer, so the suite stayed green.  A designer that
answered the choice with "no pictures" would instead fit rows to a disk
budget the run then overruns, because the page starts every recipe with
the standard picture set.
