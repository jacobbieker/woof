"""The admission gate has to price the run the config asks for.

THE DEFECT, MEASURED AT THE 2.2.0 CUT.  ``woof go`` refused a 550x550x49
config with ``[tiles] mode = "on"`` and 200x200 tiles -- the exact shape
streaming exists for -- because every memory term in
:mod:`woof.core.preflight` itemizes a domain RESIDENT in VRAM.  The
refusal read "the forecast is the memory-binding phase at 15.36 GiB peak
envelope ... EXCEEDS the 13.09 GiB budget by 2.27 GiB" on a card with
15.24 GiB free, and the remedy it printed was ``--no-memory-gate``.

``woof check`` said the quiet part out loud on the same file: "[tiles]
mode = 'on' is configured, and every memory number in this report prices
the RESIDENT allocation -- this estimator has no model of a streamed
domain, so a refusal here is a statement about a resident run."

So the one configuration class the release's headline feature exists to
enable was refused BY DEFAULT and reachable only behind a flag, which is
the "fixed means default" law failing in the most direct way available.
These tests are the front door: they drive ``memory_gate`` with a probe
standing in for the card, and they fail if the streamed config stops being
admitted or if a genuinely-too-big one stops being refused.

# * the phase estimate was DISCARDED whole -- streamed forecast term
#   included -- whenever the source's ingest lane could not be priced, so
#   every config forced to a source outside SOURCE_ANALYSIS_LEVELS fell
#   back to the resident envelope and was refused at exit 4 / exit 1;
# * the phase estimate was asked for without a ``machine``, so
#   ``mode = "auto"`` was priced against whatever card happened to be in
#   the machine running the report rather than the one it was told to size
#   for -- or, with no CuPy at all, silently reverted to resident.
#
# The pair below is the contract: the envelope the report prints, the exit
# code it returns and the gate leg it evaluates all describe the run the
# config asks for, AND a config that does not fit even streamed is still
# refused, in streamed numbers.

#: Straddles the streamed envelope of the 550sq/200-tile config above
#: (11.80 GiB under the itemized model, 2026-09-10, against the 12.80 GiB
#: envelope budget this declares) while leaving the resident one (14.31
#: GiB) outside it.  ``--budget-gib`` alone, with no ``--vram-gib``:
#: naming a capacity would let the report recognise the card under the
#: desk and price the local profile, which makes the numbers a property
#: of the machine running the tests.
#:
#: IT USED TO BE 6, THEN 8, and each move was a fix rather than a drift.
#: At 6 the streamed envelope carried only what the affine rung model
#: said the tiling HOLDS (6.71 GiB against an 8.79 GiB budget); at 8 the

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ``StreamedEnvelope.vram_bytes`` prices what a streamed forecast HOLDS.
# Under the affine measured-rung model that was the CUDA context, the
# rung's per-process fixed cost and the tile buffers, and a radiation
# step then allocated, used and freed a working set on top of it --
# MEASURED at +2.74 GiB on the three-domain 9/3/1 km run and carried as
# ``tilestream.autoplan.RADIATION_TRANSIENT_BYTES``, added to the hold as
# ``radiation_transient_bytes`` to make ``peak_vram_bytes``.
#
# THE ITEMIZED MODEL PRICES THE PEAK INSIDE THE BUFFER.  A prepared
# forecast is priced by :mod:`woof.core.prepared_tile_memory`, which
# itemizes each buffer at its own window and RETAINS the RTE named storage
# per stream (``buffer/radiation_named_storage_bytes``: the standalone
# workspace of the unfused LW/SW call at that window's column count), so
# what the card holds at the instant radiation fires is already in
# ``vram_bytes`` and the separate transient is zero for these fixtures.
# The straddle that mattered -- a card or budget that holds the process
# BETWEEN radiation calls and not AT one -- is still the defect the
# omission of 2.5 admitted (a download, a preparation and a forecast that
# dies at ``itimestep == 1``), and it is built below from the model's own
# terms: the total WITHOUT the per-buffer radiation storage on one side,
# the priced total WITH it on the other.
#
# THE OMISSION, as it was found: the planner reserved the transient before
# it picked a tile (``autoplan.budget_for``) and the streamed-init road
# added it before it picked a road, but the ESTIMATE surfaces -- the
# wizard's fit, ``woof check``'s streamed alloc leg, ``run-plan
# --estimate`` and ``woof go``'s memory gate -- priced the steady state
# alone.  A PINNED tiling made that the whole story: it consults no
# planner, so nothing anywhere on its path had the number at all.

#: Free VRAM above what the fixture holds BETWEEN radiation calls (its
#: two buffers without their RTE named storage: 7.80 GiB under the
#: itemized model, 2026-09-10, and above its 8.34 GiB ingest phase) and
#: below the 11.80 GiB it holds when radiation fires.  This is the card
#: the omission admits and the run dies on, and the FORECAST is what has
#: to bind here or the leg is measuring the ingest term instead.  The
#: tests do not pin either figure: they re-add both from the terms.

#: radiation peak reached these surfaces, which is the same statement from
