"""The whole-slab SFLX prefix, against the per-column batch, bit for bit.

:func:`woof.core.noahmp_sflx_pre_slab.evaluate_sflx_pre_slab` answers the same
physical calls as :func:`woof.core.noahmp_sflx_pre_gpu.evaluate_sflx_pre_calls`
with the same four kernels; what it removes is the CPython between them.  So the
only thing that can be wrong with it is *packing* -- a value in the wrong
column, the wrong keyword or the wrong slot -- and packing is the one defect a
bitwise arithmetic comparison of the kernels themselves cannot see.  The gate is
therefore: run both on identical inputs and require every field of
:class:`~woof.core.noahmp_sflx.PreEnergy` and of its nested
:class:`~woof.core.noahmp_sflx.EnergyCall` to be bitwise identical, field by
field, column by column.

The columns are the four unmodified-WRF whole-column fixtures crossed against
each other three ways -- parameters and snow column from one case, forcing from
a second, SMC from a third -- which gives 64 heterogeneous land columns and
invents no number.  The diagonal of that cross product is the four fixture
columns themselves; the off-diagonal entries pair a fixture's snow pack with
another fixture's weather, which is exactly the heterogeneity a real tile has
and which a per-column list can hide from a slab packer.
``test_the_slab_columns_are_heterogeneous`` asserts the coverage the gate needs
(rain, snowfall, bare, vegetated, a multi-layer snow pack, ``isnow == 0``) out
of the *host* answers, so it is proved rather than claimed.

Two negative controls run first in spirit and last in file order: rolling one
input field one column onto its neighbour, and transposing two input fields.
Both are the defect a slab seam actually produces, and both are shown being
rejected -- until that is observed, the comparison above is a gate that has
never been seen to fail.
