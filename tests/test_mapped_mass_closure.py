# tests/test_mapped_mass_closure.py  (WP-5 workstream A: mapped column-mass
# closure on a synthetic Lambert open-BC domain)
"""The mapped counterpart of the flat closure test in tests/test_openbc.py.

Everything here is measured through the production ``step()`` call on a
state whose map factors come from the production Lambert projection, so
the closure is scored against what the shipped acoustic kernel does
rather than against a re-derivation of it.

The measured residuals this module reports are committed as data.  The
absolute residual BOUND is deliberately absent: pinning it is
measure-once-then-commit under owner decision D-15, and inventing one
here would calibrate a gate to its own first measurement without the
sign-off that decision exists to provide.  What the module does assert,
bound-free, is that the closure is strictly better than each mutant --
the sensitivity claim, which is the half that can be established without
D-15.
