"""Is a woof wrfout a *WRF* wrfout, judged by a WRF reader?

Every other wrfout test in this repository reads the file back with
``netCDF4`` and compares it against what this repository believes it wrote.
That is a self-consistency check, and self-consistency is exactly what the
v1.1 scheme extension had: it wrote ``ISNOWXY`` as a float32 and read
``ISNOWXY`` back as a float32, and every test passed while no WRF-name
consumer on earth could find Noah-MP's state at all.

So this file judges the file by two authorities that are not this
repository:

* **wrf-rust** -- the mandated downstream analysis library, its real
  ``WrfFile``/``getvar`` API, opening a file the production writer produced
  from a real forecast.  It answers "can a WRF reader find this field?",
  and its answer for a Noah-MP field before v1.1.3 was ``unknown
  variable``.
* the **pinned WRF v4.6.1 Registry**, transcribed in
  ``woof.io.wrf_output_schema``, plus the group's own v4.6.1 reference
  wrfout where it carries the same variable.  Those answer "is the schema
  the field claims the schema WRF declares?".

The wrf-rust reader promotes everything it returns to float64, which is a
perfectly reasonable thing for an analysis library to do and is also why it
cannot be the witness for on-disk type.  The witness for type is the file:
``netCDF4`` reading the variable's ``dtype`` and ``FieldType`` is not a
mock of the writer, it is the artifact.  So the two halves are split on
purpose -- names and values through the real consumer, declared type and
dimensions through the real file.
