"""The version in ``pyproject.toml`` must be the one being cut.

This file exists because the 2.5.0 integration line carried
``version = "2.4.1"`` -- the number of the newest *published* release --
for its whole life, while ``## Unreleased`` in ``CHANGELOG.md`` filled up
with the work that line exists to ship.

Nothing in the tree noticed, and nothing could have: ``woof.__version__``
is read from installed distribution metadata, so it reports whatever pip
last wrote; the publish workflow's ``cut`` job reads the version out of
``pyproject.toml`` and only compares it against the *tag it was handed*.
Tag ``v2.4.1`` against pyproject ``2.4.1`` agrees perfectly and republishes
an already-published number; tag ``v2.5.0`` against pyproject ``2.4.1``
fails at job 3 of 10 -- after the tag is pushed and the draft exists, which
is to say after the number is spent.

So the oracle here is the changelog, which is the only place in the tree
that records what has actually shipped.  Two invariants come out of it and
both are mechanical:

* the declared version may not be a version that already shipped, and
* it must lead every entry the changelog records.

Both are conditioned the way the release cycle actually runs.  On the day
of a cut the version and the changelog head SHOULD be equal -- that is the
state the workflow's tag comparison wants -- so the equality gate keys off
``## Unreleased`` carrying pending work, which is the one arrangement in
which a spent number is unambiguously wrong.  Nobody has to remember to
bump anything: the first commit that lands work under a published number
fails here by name.
