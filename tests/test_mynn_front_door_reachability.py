"""MYNN was runnable and unreachable at the same time.

The reopening battery found the shipped MYNN suite integrating a full
simulated hour from both GFS and native HRRR -- and every MYNN tuple other
than MYNN+WSM6 unreachable from any front door, because
``woof import-namelist`` had no mapping for ``bl_pbl_physics = 5``
(``implemented: [0, 1, 11]``).  The B-M1 snow fix exists precisely for
MP 6/8/10/18; only MP 6 could be reached.

``woof/namelist_import.py`` says admitting a scheme means widening three
things together -- the importer map, its ``physics_compat`` readiness row,
and its dispatch row.  For MYNN two of the three were already done.  This
file pins all three to each other so the lagging-leg failure cannot recur
silently, and shows the readiness authority following WRF's mixed-pair law.
