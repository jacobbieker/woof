"""A land-use class the vegetation table does not cover is a named refusal.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
Driving a generated MPAS mesh through the dycore on a development machine's 5090 stopped in
`noahmp_cold_start` with:

    File "woof/core/noahmp_runtime.py", line 863, in veg_value
      return float(entry[int(vegtyp) - 1] if len(entry) > 1 else entry[0])
    IndexError: tuple index out of range

The mesh refines to 15 km over 41.5N 88W, which resolves the Great Lakes. The
geography archive on that box is `modis_landuse_20class_30s_with_lakes`, whose
lake class is 21. `MODIFIED_IGBP_MODIS_NOAH` declares NVEG = 20. So 115 cells
of the native static (1,074 of the Rust static) carried `ivgtyp = 21` and the
cold start indexed one past the end of a 20-entry tuple.

This is not a property of that mesh. It is reachable by anyone who refines
over a lake with that archive, and the published x1/x4 meshes hide it only
because they are too coarse to resolve one -- both top out at ivgtyp 19.

`IndexError: tuple index out of range` names nothing: not the class, not the
table, not the cells, not the way through. A refusal that does not name the
breakage it prevents is a defect in its own right.
