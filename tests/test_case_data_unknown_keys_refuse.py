"""A ``[case_data]`` key this schema does not know is a wrong answer.

This is the third appearance of one defect.  ``woof/experiment.py``'s
``_reject_unknown_keys`` warned and dropped (fixed in ``a4417efb``);
``twentycrv3_wrf.main``'s translation of the ``[case_data]`` refusal
stopped firing when unknown TABLES were switched to warning (restored in
``83720e6c``); and ``build_case_data`` -- in a module whose own docstring
says "fail-loud" -- warned and dropped unknown ``[case_data]`` keys.

Exposure is the five OPTIONAL keys, because those are optional by
construction: nothing after the required-key check ever looks for them,
so a misspelling of any one passes every remaining check and the case
loads with the built-in default under the name of the user's value::

    forcing_interval_s  output_domain  source_orography
    source_orography_variable  co2_vmr

``forcing_interval_s`` is the one that reaches the numbers, in two
places.  It is enforced against the decoded schedule
(:func:`woof.runtime.forcing_schedule`), and -- the part that changes a
forecast rather than merely failing to guard one -- it SELECTS the
forcing window the input catalog consumes: ``_select_contiguous_times``
keeps the unique longest contiguous run at the declared interval and
excludes everything else.  A CDS retrieval that returns a date x time
cross-product has non-contiguous extras in it; the declared interval is
what removes them.

Measured on this tree against the real May-1999 ERA5 case, through the
shipped CLI, before the fix:

  ``forcing_interval_s   = 21600.0``  ->  rc 0, PASS, 3 valid times,
                                          43200 s of coverage
  ``forcing_interval_s   = 10800.0``  ->  rc 2, "declared
                                          forcing_interval_s = 10800 but
                                          the decoded schedule steps ...
                                          (21600 s)", no wrfout
  ``forcing_interval_sec = 10800.0``  ->  rc 0, ONE stderr warning,
                                          ``time.forcing_interval_s =
                                          discover``, 5 valid times,
                                          108000 s of coverage, two
                                          wrfout frames, ``nan_free
                                          True``

The same number, one letter apart, is either a refusal or a completed
forecast built on a forcing window nobody selected.

Every test here fails against the tree as it stood at ``b654a3e0``.
