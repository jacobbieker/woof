The lat-lon refusal itself is unchanged and is NOT relaxed here: what
changes is that the set it enumerates and the sentence it gives are
published once, by the module that would have to grow the projection
(:mod:`woof.static.projection`), instead of being typed out again in
every door that answers for it.
