"""cumastrn:562-590 graded at ``max_ulp == 0`` -- the ktype flip.

THE FIRST PIECE OF ORCHESTRATION TO GAIN AN OWNER, and the one the port
exists for. Thirty lines between cuascn and cudlfsn carrying:

* ``:566-568`` -- the ktype flip. A deep column whose cloud is shallower
  than 200 hPa becomes ktype 2; a shallow one that is deeper becomes
  ktype 1. ktype selects ``scale_fac`` (deep) or ``scale_fac2`` (shallow)
  in the closure. Feeding cuascn's ktype to the closure runs the wrong arm
  -- that was the fifth failure in this port, and it cost two rounds.
* ``:580-588`` -- the downdraft-array zeroing that four class-2 excuses in
  ``test_ntiedtke_aliasing_audit.py`` rest on.

NO NEW CAPTURE WAS NEEDED. This block's inputs are cuascn's outputs and its
outputs are cudlfsn's and cuddrafn's captured entry state, so it is graded
against rows that already existed -- which is the capture architecture being
reusable for something it was not built for.

        ktype 2 -> 2    6 columns     ktype 3 -> 3   12

    So the flip IS exercised and graded, but only in the shallow-to-deep
    direction. `:566` -- a DEEP column whose cloud is shallower than
    200 hPa being demoted to shallow -- is transcribed and never runs.

    That direction is the one a hurricane eyewall would take if its cloud
    were thin, and it is the direction that would move a column from
    scale_fac to scale_fac2. So the gap matters more than most.

    THIS IS A PHASE 1 COMPLETION ITEM, NOT A STANDING GAP (review,
    review), and the pricing is why:

      dx = 4500    deep    1/scale_fac    8.6%
                   shallow 1/scale_fac2  29.3%

    The untested transition MORE THAN TRIPLES the retained mass flux at
    fine-nest resolution -- 3.4x, larger than the entire GF-vs-NT gap the
    port was justified on. And it fires exactly where the campaign lives:
    thin, marginal-depth columns in an eyewall ring are the population
    most likely to satisfy `ktype == 1 .and. zpbmpt < zdnoprc`, and the
    population whose behaviour decides whether the port works. Section 3
    also records that the SHALLOW branch has already been misunderstood
    once in this port; the transition into it being ungraded is the same
    blind spot one level upstream.

    The failure mode is what makes it urgent rather than tidy: a reference tropical-cyclone
    run whose eyewall columns take an ungraded transition does not crash
    and does not look wrong. It produces a plausible number, and a
    disappointing f012 could not be attributed to the physics or to this
    arm. Unfalsifiable after the fact, cheap to prevent now.

    THE CASE TABLE ALREADY BRACKETS IT. Section 9 records case 1 as too
    deep to demote (kcbot 47 to kctop 3) and cases 8-11 as too weak to
    trigger. The demotion case is between them: forcing strong enough
    that cutypen calls it deep and cuascn sustains a plume, under a cap
    that terminates that plume at modest depth. That is the same "two
    things at once" shape that took three rounds on case 11.

    Written toward the gap: this FAILS when such a case is added, and
    that failure is the signal to require both directions instead.
