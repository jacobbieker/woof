"""Noah against the byte-unmodified WRF v4.6.1 driver, for the first time.

``sf_surface_physics=2`` is the land surface in every registry template and
every production config in this tree, and until this file existed no WRF
number had ever been produced for it.  ``kernels/noah.cu`` was checked only
against ``woof.verify.npref.np_noah_column`` -- a float64 mirror of the same
transcription -- plus energy closure and physics plausibility, all of which a
transcription error present in both copies passes.  ``tools/noah_wrf461_oracle/``
now drives ``lsm`` in the pinned tree over 42 land columns and dumps every
driver input and every driver output; this module measures the kernel against
that dump and pins what it measures.

**The numbers below are a measurement, not a target.**  They record what the
shipped kernel actually does, so it cannot change without someone saying so in
a commit.  They are asserted for *equality*: a kernel that got better silently
is as much a drift as one that got worse.  Every baseline was produced twice
on the local RTX 5090 in separate processes and was bit-identical.

What the oracle found on its first run
--------------------------------------

1. ``chklowq`` was 0.0 against WRF's 1.0 on the open-water and sea-ice
   columns.  ``module_sf_noahdrv.F`` writes CHKLOWQ for every column at
   :809-814, *before* the XLAND branch; the kernel returned from its three
   skip paths without writing it.  Fixed in its own commit, and the mirror had
   it right all along -- which is precisely why 37 self-consistency tests
   could not see it.
2. Case 18 -- ``SNOW`` is the smallest positive subnormal.  Held out below.
3. The frozen-ground infiltration family (cases 6, 7, 42) and the fp64 energy
   residual, both described beside their baselines.  The first of those was
   filed as libm noise for a release and was not: ``SRT`` was being reached
   with ``REDPRM``'s ``FRZFACT`` where WRF passes its ``FRZX``, so ``ACRT``
   ran 1/FRZK = 6.67x large and the frozen-ground infiltration limiter did
   not limit.  Both the mirror and the kernel had made the same substitution,
   so only this fixture could see it -- and only once something graded the
   *mirror* against WRF too, which nothing did until
   :func:`test_the_mirror_reproduces_wrfs_frozen_ground_infiltration`.

This gate has been observed to fail
----------------------------------

A gate that has never fired is not evidence, so it was made to fire twice
before it was committed, by patching ``kernels/noah.cu`` and re-running:

* deleting the one-line ``chklowq`` fix -- the defect this oracle found --
  moves ``chklowq`` from 0 to 1065353216 and the table assertion fails;
* respelling ``q2k = qv1/(1+qv1)`` as the algebraically identical
  ``1 - 1/(1+qv1)`` moves ``snopcx`` from 1125 to 1243 and it fails again.

One mutation that did *not* fire is worth recording too: perturbing ``val =
1 - expf(-kdt*dt1)`` by a relative 1e-7 changed nothing, because ``kdt*dt1``
is small enough that the perturbation falls below float32 resolution there.
The table is sensitive to the physics, not to every keystroke in the file.

The two CPU gates below were made to fire the same way, on the tree as it
stood before the FRZX fix: the mirror gate reports case 6 SFCRUNOFF
8.477e-05 against WRF's 4.935e-03, and the source gate reports ``noah_smflx``
called with ``frzfact``.  nvcc is a third witness -- it emitted ``variable
"frzx" was declared but never referenced`` for ``noah.cu`` until the fix.

Held-out columns
----------------

Three fixture columns are excluded from the ULP table and asserted
individually.  None of them measures arithmetic; folding a branch or a
not-ported routine into a ULP maximum hides it behind a big number.

* **case 18** -- ``SNOW`` is the smallest positive float32 subnormal.  WRF's
  ``IF(SNOW(I,J).GT.0.0)`` is TRUE, so the column takes the ice-saturation
  ``Q2SAT``/``DQSDT2`` blend; CuPy appends ``-ftz=true`` unconditionally, the
  subnormal flushes, and the kernel's ``snow_a[idx] > 0.0f`` is FALSE, so it
  takes the snow-free arm.  The port's answer for case 18 is *bit-identical to
  its own case 1*, which is the snow-free column; WRF's is not.  Cost: 0.083 K
  in TSK, 1.95 W/m2 in HFX, 2.87 W/m2 in LH.  This is the fourth instance of
  the ``-ftz`` class in this project and the first one an oracle fixture has
  ever caught.
* **case 25** -- ``CHS``/``CHS2``/``CQS2`` are all the smallest positive
  subnormal.  WRF itself fills the column with NaN, including SMOIS, SH2O and
  TSLB.  The kernel produces NaN in a *different* subset: TSK, HFX, LH,
  GRDFLX, QSFC and POTEVP are NaN in both, but the kernel keeps a finite
  0.464 soil moisture where WRF has NaN, and writes QFX = 0 where WRF writes
  147.7.  Neither answer is usable; the row is here so that "an unrunnable
  input is unrunnable in both" is a recorded fact rather than an assumption.
* **case 28** -- ``ivgtyp == isice``.  WRF calls ``SFLX_GLACIAL``
  (``module_sf_noahlsm_glacial_only.F``); woof/core/noah.py's docstring
  records that routine as not ported, and ``noah_column`` returns without
  touching the column.  Measured size of that restriction on one 60 s step:
  TSK 255.0 against 273.15 K, HFX 0 against 388.9 W/m2, LH 0 against
  -319.1 W/m2, SH2O 0.28 against 1.0.

#: since the fix; what moved, and what was stale for other reasons, is set out
#: beside the dict below.
#:
#: The table has four populations, and they are not the same kind of thing:
#:
#:   sfcrunoff      2812    FROZEN-GROUND INFILTRATION, cases 6, 7 and 42 --
#:   smstav            2    every column that is both frozen and melting snow.
#:   smstot            1    SRT (module_sf_noahlsm.F:3792-3806) reduces the

#:                          That reading was wrong: the float64 mirror calls
#:                          glibc and was 98% away from WRF on the same three
#:                          columns, so the gap was ACRT, not libm.  With FRZX
#:                          restored, three of the six are exactly bitwise and

#:
#: Ten fields are bit-identical to WRF on every column of every fixture:
#: albbck, emiss, z0, snotime, acsnow, chklowq, tslb, and -- newly, with FRZX
#: restored -- sh2o, smcrel and smois.
#: RE-MEASURED IN FULL for the FRZX fix, and again for 2.8 (item (2) below).
#:
#: (1) Improved by the FRZX repair -- six rows, every one of them a
#:     reduction, and three of them to exactly bitwise:
#:
#:       sfcrunoff  60641303 -> 2812      sh2o    6508 -> 0
#:       smcrel         4729 -> 0         smois   1627 -> 0
#:       smstav          474 -> 2         smstot    78 -> 1
#:
#:     The docstring above predicted snopcx and acsnom would move through
#:     SNOPAC as well.  They did not: both are byte-identical before and
#:     after, so the FRZX chain does not reach them on these four fixtures.
#:
#: (2) Eight rows the FRZX change also re-pinned, from a reading taken on its
#:     own branch, came back into this tree with values the kernel here does
#:     not produce: snow 0, snowh 0, tsk 1, znt 0, canwat 5, lh 4, qsfc 6 and
#:     snopcx 1141.  MEASURED 2026-09-28 on sm_120, where every release gate
#:     of this line runs: the RTX 5090 with NVRTC 12.9.86, 13.0.48 and
#:     13.4.92 and the RTX 5070 Ti with 13.0.88 and 13.3.33 all give, to the
#:     ULP, the values the table held before that merge --
#:
#:       snow 10     snowh 9     tsk 2     znt 1
#:       canwat 8    lh 3        qsfc 3    snopcx 1125
#:
#:     -- together with the six FRZX rows in (1) exactly as that change
#:     recorded them.  noah.cu at the branch head and at this tree's parent
#:     differ only by the three FRZX call sites, so the other reading was
#:     not of a different kernel source; no sm_120 compiler reproduces it,
#:     and the card it came from is not recorded.  The development desktop's
#:     RTX 3080 (sm_86, whose noah.cu frame is already known to differ:
#:     224 B against sm_120's 176 B) is the one release platform this table
#:     has not been read on, and it is read at the cut's Windows step; a
#:     different answer there makes this table per-architecture.
#:
#: (3) RE-MEASURED 2026-09-30 for A146 on the RTX 5070 Ti (sm_120, NVRTC
#:     13.4.92): NVRTC had compiled every float division by a compile-time
#:     constant as a multiply by the rounded reciprocal on Blackwell, and
#:     noah.cu now spells those divisions ``__fdiv_rn``, the IEEE quotient.
#:     Eight rows moved, and six of them to the sm_86 reading below, so the
#:     reciprocal multiply was most of what split the two cards:
#:
#:       snow 10 -> 2      snowh 9 -> 1      tsk 2 -> 1       znt 1 -> 0
#:       canwat 8 -> 5     lh 3 -> 4 (worse)  qsfc 3 -> 6 (worse)
#:       snopcx 1125 -> 1141 (worse)
#:
#:     Every other row, the six FRZX rows in (1) included, read as before.
