"""A stop reaches the process that was recorded and nothing else, and the assistant's server is never lost.

The defects this file holds shut:

- Stop, its escalation a minute later and the assistant's unload checked a
  recorded process and then signalled its number: a process that ended in
  between could have its number handed to another program, which the
  signal reached.  The signal now goes through the checked process's own
  handle (a Linux pidfd, or a Windows handle held across taskkill).
- The assistant's server record was deleted before the server was
  stopped, so a stop that did not take left a model on the card that
  nothing could find again; a server that stopped answering was replaced
  while it still ran; a server that could not be started raised a
  traceback; and a failed unload failed the forecast start that asked
  for it.
