"""The LETKF's cost against radar COUNT, which is a different axis to obs count.

The batched transform is priced per stencil slot, not per observation:
masked-out slots are gathered, weighted by zero, and matrix-multiplied
anyway.  So the scaling question for an all-radar domain is not "how many
observations?" but "how many observation BATCHES?", and the answer used to
be brutal.  Radial velocity cannot be merged across radars -- two antennas
measure different projections of one wind -- so every radar in the domain
is its own ``GriddedObs``.  Every gridpoint then paid for every radar,
including the ones a thousand kilometres away whose Gaspari-Cohn weight is
exactly zero.  Useful work stayed flat while total work grew linearly with
the radar count, wasting ``(B-1)/B`` -- 99.4% of the solve at 160 radars.

What this file pins:

* the reject is EXACT, not an approximation -- a reach-filtered analysis is
  bitwise the analysis the unfiltered code computed, on numpy, because the
  batches it drops contribute identically zero and adding 0.0 is exact;
* ``reachable_stencil_slots`` stays flat as radars are added to a domain
  they do not overlap in, while ``stencil_slots`` grows linearly -- that
  divergence is the fix, expressed as a number a receipt can carry;
* chunk sizing follows the reachable count, so the saved FLOPs are not
  handed straight back as lost occupancy on a chunk sized for work no
  gridpoint does;
* a domain wider than its radar coverage skips whole chunks.

Numpy only, deliberately: the reject is index arithmetic and its
correctness claim is bitwise, which is a numpy claim.  On the device the
same analysis is exact to rounding rather than to the byte, for the reason
``_solve_chunk`` documents -- dropping terms changes the extent cuBLAS
partitions its summations on.
