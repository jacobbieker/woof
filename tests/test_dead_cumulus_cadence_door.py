"""One cumulus-off suite, two spellings of a switch it never reads.

``cudt_minutes`` is the interval between cumulus calls.  At
``cu_physics = 0`` there are none: ``woof/core/clock.py`` builds a
cumulus calendar only for cu_physics in (1, 3, 16), and no cumulus step
is taken without one.  The value is dead.

Its two producers spell the dead value differently.  The WRF namelist
importer omits the key for a cumulus-off suite on purpose, so the
configuration inherits ``RunConfig``'s live 5.0; every shipped
cumulus-off profile states 0.0.  The capability door compared them raw
and refused the difference, which made every namelist-routed
preparation of a cumulus-off profile impossible -- including the
nowcast front door's own default profile on its HRRR route, the route
that reaches the door through a namelist.

``woof/ingest/prepared_cache.py`` already pins the same key for the
same reason when it compares two prepared identities.  These cases hold
that rule at the capability door, and hold the door's answer for a
configuration that DOES run a cumulus scheme, where the interval is
read on every call it fires.

The prepared route asks the same question a second time, of the loaded
experiment, and refused the same two spellings there -- printing the
resolved radiation pair EQUAL in the sentence that refused the run.
The last case here holds that door to the same reconciliation, so the
two cannot answer differently.
