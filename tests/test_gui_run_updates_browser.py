"""The run map in a real browser keeps a machine's run, its drawing and its warnings up to date, or says why not.

Three defects, each on the shipped map page against the real page server and
real run folders (the follower and the engine are the test's; no forecast runs
and no weather picture is drawn):

- a machine's run whose follower ended showed the last state received
  (running, with Stop) and nothing more; the map now says its updates stopped
  and Resume updates follows it again without starting anything;
- a forecast that had finished stopped reading while a render worker still
  drew its pictures, so the open map said "No maps yet" after they had all
  arrived;
- the engine's library warning (a warm bubble above 10 K) was in the run's
  events and never on the map, live or after a reload.
