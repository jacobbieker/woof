"""A streamed domain's host memory does not grow with its tile count.

THE DEFECT.  ``streaming.tile_boundary_tables`` precomputed, for every
tile, a float64 copy of the domain's lateral forcing windowed onto that tile,
for every interval, field and side, and gave every interior side real
arrays of zeros.  Host memory therefore scaled with the NUMBER OF TILES
rather than with the domain: a 206x204x49 GFS forecast streamed with 1,190
tiles held 27.7 GB, and a reproduction reached 125 GB committed on a 96 GB
machine and was still rising -- into the pagefile, until the machine's own
management calls failed with "Out of memory".  The run-plan estimate for the
same plan said 0.93 GiB of host RAM, because it counted the pinned store and
its arena and no boundary table at all.

What is pinned here, on the CPU:

* the windowing keeps host bytes bounded by a small fraction of the
  domain's own table bytes, at 4 tiles and at 400 alike, because a tile is
  windowed when a buffer binds it, as views;
* a true-edge side is a view of the domain's table and an interior side is
  a zero-stride view of one shared zero -- neither allocates;
* the host estimate (``run-plan --estimate``, ``woof check``, the ``woof
  go`` gate) counts the domain's forcing series in ``host_bytes``, on the
  single-domain road and for a streamed root on a nested tree's mixed road.

The GPU half -- that a streamed run on these tables is bit-identical to the
resident run -- is ``tilestream/test_join.py`` and ``tilestream/test_route.py``.
