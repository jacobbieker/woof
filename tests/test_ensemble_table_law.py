"""A new source or preparation runner is table work in the ensemble line.

The law (project ruling of 2026-08-16): adding a model must be metadata, not a
new code path, and no model name may reach generic identifiers or defaults.
The ensemble line once dispatched on names in code: ``runner == "<id>"`` in
the shared geography build, a hard-coded set of runner ids at the physical
store door, a ``(source, mode)`` pair in the decoder resolver, a list of two
source ids in the default selection policy, and one contract module per
source. Each of those facts is now a column of the source adapter table, a
field of the preparation runner table, or a packaged authority document.
A preparation chain's ID can carry a source name (``prepared:<source>``), so
what a chain checks before its fetch is a row of
``woof.regional_preparation.preparation_chain_reviews`` that a door reads,
not a branch on the chain ID.

The first test here is the law itself. It walks both tables for every source
id, alias and runner id, then reads the generic ensemble code with ``ast`` and
fails on any of them outside a docstring. The allow list is short and every
entry states its reason. The other tests are the acceptance side: a synthetic
row with the same capabilities is served by every generic door with no code
change, and the data move changed no contract byte.

Scope. The ensemble package and the ensemble tools are generic code and are
read whole. The older native preparations (their own modules outside this
package) name themselves by design and are not read here.
