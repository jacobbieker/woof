"""An adaptive run must be able to restart from its own checkpoints.

THE BUG THIS PINS.  ``AdaptiveClockDriver._apply`` overwrites TWO
``RunConfig`` fields on the live config every root step -- ``dt`` and
``time_step_sound`` -- while ``_require_config_match``'s identity walk
exempted only the first.  A checkpoint therefore stored the DERIVED
sound-step count and the walk compared it against the config's DECLARED
one and refused:

    time_step_sound: restart=6 run=4

so every checkpoint an adaptive run wrote became unrestartable as soon as
its step grew enough to move that count.  On a sub-km nest that is almost
immediate -- :func:`wrf_num_sound_steps` leaves 4 the moment
``300*dt/spacing >= 2`` -- which defeated ``restart_interval_s`` on
exactly the runs most likely to need it: the long ones, and the ones that
die.

The fix is NOT to stop comparing ``time_step_sound``.  Under a fixed
clock it is a real model difference and a resume that changes it must
still be refused; these gates pin both halves.
