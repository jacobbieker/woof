"""A computer whose woof cannot run a forecast is told so before Start, not after.

The defect this file holds shut: on an install without the GPU runtime
(CuPy), the page's queue answered ``start_now: true`` for this computer and
Start was on.  The forecast was launched, ``woof run-plan`` refused at its
first step for want of the runtime, and the forecast was listed as failed.
A forecast queued for this computer was started into the same refusal.

The page server refuses to import CuPy itself, so the runtime is looked for
on the import path, never imported; that refusal must not read as a
missing runtime.
