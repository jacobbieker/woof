"""GEFS through the gauntlet: an ensemble member is TABLE DATA end to end.

A deterministic model was already proved to enter as three packaged JSON
documents plus registry rows.  This file pins the ensemble twin of that
shape: the SAME three documents and rows give one *member* of NCEP's
global ensemble a runnable IC route, on top of the member-addressing
grammar the ensemble capability already ships
(``rw-wps-gefs-ensemble-grib2.members.json``).  No GEFS decode code
exists anywhere; the two facts that make the ensemble hard are stated as
table data:

* ``pgrb2a`` and ``pgrb2b`` isobaric level sets are exactly disjoint
  (zero overlapping levels for any variable, MEASURED), so the mapping's
  31-level ladder is only satisfiable by passing BOTH files of the SAME
  member -- the frame assembler's one-GRIB-member rule then refuses a
  cross-member mix by construction.
* Every selector pins ``pdt`` 1 (instantaneous member forecast), so the
  ensemble mean/spread files that share the member directories (PDT 2)
  and the PDT-11 accumulation twins that appear from f003 can never
  satisfy a state selector.

Selectors were authored from real 2026-08-17 00Z bytes
(gec00/gep01/gep02 pgrb2a+pgrb2b, ``noaa-gefs-pds``) through the
converged grib-core inventory; the octets asserted here are the observed
ones.
