"""A run that did not finish keeps its pictures, under a banner.

WHAT BREAKAGE THESE PIN (gate law).  A downscale child drew its analysis
frame early, stopped part way through its forecast, and the door then
removed every picture it had published -- so the pictures that would
have shown a reader what the forecast was doing before it stopped
existed only until the moment they became useful.  The frames survived,
but a reader opening the render directory found nothing at all, which
reads as "this run drew nothing" rather than "this run stopped".

Four groups: the pictures stay, the banner says where the forecast
stopped, the render summary carries the same status the banner does,
and the names this module publishes all resolve on it.
