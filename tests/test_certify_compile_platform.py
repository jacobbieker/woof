"""``woof certify`` sees the two things it used to be blind to.

Two conditions were written, shipped, and never called: the compile-platform
fingerprint that separates one NVRTC build from another, and the guard that
asks whether a capsule's kernel manifest recorded anything at all.  With both
unwired, ``woof certify`` printed ``PASS`` over a capsule compiled by a
different compiler than the one now installed, and over a capsule whose
kernel manifest was empty.  A false green on the certification path launders
drift as verified, which is worse than having no instrument.

Every refusal here is measured through :func:`woof.cli.main`, so what is
asserted is the exit code and the sentence a reader actually gets.

**Both directions, on the instrument itself.**  A check that only ever passes
is the bug being fixed here, so each condition is exercised on a good input
and on a bad one, and the decision function is additionally held to the trap
that makes this class of instrument lie: two fingerprints that measured
nothing are *equal*, so an unguarded comparison reports "no drift" over an
unverified platform.  ``compile_platform_agreement`` must refuse to reach a
verdict at all in that case rather than compute one from what is there.
