"""Does the nine-level RUC remap actually reach a RUC forecast?

``woof/ingest/ruc_soil.py`` was ``init_soil_depth_3`` + ``init_soil_3_real``
at max_ulp 0 against ``woof/data/ruc/oracle/soil_ingest.csv`` for a week
before it had a single importer anywhere under ``gpuwm/``.  All seven
initializers called ``preprocess_noah_soil`` unconditionally, so a
``sf_surface_physics=3`` request received four Noah layer MIDPOINTS and ran a
complete, plausible forecast on a soil discretization RUC does not use.

This file is the wiring, bound to code rather than to prose.  Three claims:

1. every initializer routes its soil source through the land-surface seam,
   and a RUC config through that seam gets RUC's nine LEVEL depths;
2. a Noah or Noah-MP config through the same seam is **bitwise** what
   ``preprocess_noah_soil`` returns -- every array, every byte; and
3. the seam is fail-closed on the selector, so an unrecognised
   ``sf_surface_physics`` raises instead of quietly taking Noah's arm.

Claim 2 is structural as well as measured: ``preprocess_ruc_soil`` *calls*
``preprocess_noah_soil`` for the surface bookkeeping rather than copying or
parameterising it, and ``woof/ingest/soil.py`` is not edited at all.  The
byte comparison below is the check on that claim, not the reason to believe
it.
