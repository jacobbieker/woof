"""The mp=28 publication layer must be DERIVED from the gate, not retyped.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
``docs/public/PHYSICS.md`` is the page a user reads before selecting
``mp_physics = 28``; ``docs/public/validation/mp28-column-evidence.md``,
``PROVENANCE.md``, ``CHANGELOG.md`` and ``woof/physics_registry_v2.json``
are the four texts it points at.  Five waves of this port have shipped at
least one of those five quoting a residual, a count or a call graph the
code no longer produced.  It has happened every wave, it has been caught
every wave by a different auditor, and patching the literals again would
only reset the clock.

So this file does not check prose.  It DERIVES the publishable facts from
the objects that own them and asserts the documents match:

======================================  =====================================
fact                                    authority it is derived from
======================================  =====================================
is the synthetic aerosol profile        an AST-free source scan for callers
installed on a production run?          of ``microphysics_init`` in ``gpuwm/``
which fixtures clear a flat gate,       ``tests/test_thompson_aerosol_adapter
which clear it only allowanced,         .py``'s ``_G3_UNEXCEPTIONED_CLEAN``,
which miss, and by how much             ``_G3_GATED_CLEAN``, ``_G3_RESIDUALS``
the carve-out and its bound             the same file's ``_END_TO_END_BOUNDS``
what the aerosol initial condition      ``tests/test_mp28_forecast_smoke.py``'s
is worth to a forecast                  ``_forecast``, re-run on the device
what closed ``aero-ice-koop``           the committed fixture deck itself,
                                        re-inverted under both Exner constants
the profile values the page quotes      the ``aero-init-profile`` fixture
======================================  =====================================

Every one of those is two-directional.  A document may not understate the
port either: an evidence page that still calls a closed gap open is exactly
as false as one that calls an open gap closed, and it is the failure mode a
"the page must warn" test rots into the day the gap shuts.

THE PAIR THIS FILE USED TO CARRY, AND WHY IT WAS UNSATISFIABLE
--------------------------------------------------------------
Wave 4 wrote this module when ``microphysics_init`` had no production
caller.  ``PHYSICS.md`` printed a manual workaround --
``woof.core.microphysics.microphysics_init(state, cfg)`` -- and
``test_the_workaround_the_page_prints_is_real`` asserted the workaround was
importable.  Wave 5 WIRED the call
(``woof/core/physics.py::initialize_physics``), at which point
``test_physics_md_does_not_claim_the_synthetic_profile_is_installed``
started requiring that the page NOT contain ``microphysics_init(state,
cfg)`` -- a substring of the string the other test required.  No page
satisfied both.

Both tests are still here, both still fail in both directions, and neither
was weakened to make the pair satisfiable.  What changed is that the second
one now gates the REAL call site instead of a workaround for its absence --
it asserts strictly more than it did (the hook's signature and off-mp=28
no-op behaviour are still checked, plus the caller, plus that the caller is
unique, plus that the page prints no workaround while a caller exists), so
it is renamed to ``test_the_production_call_site_the_page_names_is_real``
to stop the name lying about what it covers.

NOT a style test.  Every assertion corresponds to a statement that was
false on some tree this port actually shipped.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: The sibling texts that carried the false "the profile is installed"
#: sentence when this file was written, mapped to the name the page uses for
#: each and to the regexes that detect the claim in that text's own wording.
#: Kept separate from :data:`_ASSERTS_THE_PROFILE_IS_INSTALLED` because these
#: are broader -- they must catch "runs it on", "always starts from the
#: synthetic profile" and "comes from thompson_init's synthetic ... profile",
#: phrasings PHYSICS.md must remain free to discuss in the negative.
#:
#: THE POLARITY IS THE CODE'S, NOT THIS TABLE'S.  While the hook had no
#: caller these sentences were false and the page had to name whoever still
#: carried them.  Now that the call is wired they are TRUE, so the page must
#: name nobody -- and the day the call site is dropped, the list comes back.
