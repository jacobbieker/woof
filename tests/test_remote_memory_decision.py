"""One sizing statement, both remote doors, and no card is ever refused for it.

A remote memory figure is an estimate made before the run exists. Every door
states it, prices an unmeasured card from recorded capacity, and launches the
configuration the reader asked for. CPU-only: no card is opened, no forecast is
planned and no probe subprocess runs.
