"""The daemon's argv builders must satisfy the signatures they call.

Every stage of the continuous nowcast daemon is a subprocess whose
command line is built by a function that lives in ``tools.da_nowcast``.
A keyword that stops matching is not a lint: it is a ``TypeError`` on the
daemon's FIRST observation stage, hours after somebody launched it and
walked away.  That break shipped once -- ``obs_cmd`` grew a required
``dealias`` argument and the daemon's call site did not -- and it
escaped every existing test because the three tests that name ``Daemon``
read its source as TEXT rather than binding the call.

So this file binds.  It reads each call site out of the daemon's own AST
and offers the keyword names to the real :func:`inspect.signature` of the
function being called.  A missing required keyword-only argument, or a
keyword the callee does not accept, fails here rather than in the field.

Pure tests: no network, no GPU, no subprocess execution.  Sites are
synthetic ids -- real station names never enter the tree's generic code
or its fixtures (standing owner rule).
