"""Analysis-hour-first fetch ordering, pinned as a contract.

Every prepared-route fetch hands its transfers to the pool in ladder
order, analysis lead first (``f000`` by default, ``f{K}`` under
``--forecast-start-hour K``).  The contract a consumer reads lives at
the RECEIPT: ``forecast_hours`` claims a contiguous ascending prefix,
so "the analysis is on disk and verified" is true the moment the first
hour is claimed -- which is the seam any start-preparation-early work
attaches to, and it survives the pooled default because admission is in
submission order no matter when each hour's bytes finish landing.

Two layers are pinned here:

* the ladder builders put the forecast-start lead first, always;
* under ``--fetch-workers 1`` -- the serial transport, a first-class
  knob -- the BYTES also land strictly in ladder order, for the
  byte-range HRRR transport, the NOMADS subset transport, and the
  ``rw_fetch`` full-file backbone.  The pooled default overlaps
  transfers, so byte-landing order is deliberately unpinned there; the
  receipt-order tests are the ones that hold for every pool size.
