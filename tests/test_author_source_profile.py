"""The offline profile-authoring tool is generic; the models are DATA.

The project ruling (2026-08-17): model names live in data, never in code or in
tool filenames, and that reaches the OFFLINE generators too.  Two
one-shot scripts used to carry a model in their filename and the model's
whole authority content in Python -- so a new model meant a new script,
which is exactly the per-model adapter the arbitrary acceptance test
forbids.

The breakage this file prevents: a packaged profile whose derivation is
unreproducible.  Every authority these specs name is regenerated here
and compared BYTE FOR BYTE against the document the wheel ships, so a
spec that drifts from its committed authority fails instead of rotting
quietly (which is exactly what had happened to the retired AIGEFS
script -- it no longer reproduced two of the four documents it claimed
to author).
