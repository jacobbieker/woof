# The FP32 ULP distance of the CPU reference from the unmodified WRF v4.6.1
# oracle, measured per (stage, output, column) -- one integer per compared
# number, in fixture column order (``NARROW_CASES`` / ``WIDE_CASES`` above).
# An output a stage does not name is bitwise on every column of that stage and
# is required to stay bitwise: the lookup returns zeros.
#
# There is no margin here to justify, because there is no margin: each entry is
# the residue that was measured at that element, and the gate is
# ``residue <= entry`` column by column.  The previous revision budgeted per
# *fixture* -- one table shared by the widened fixture's three stages, maxed
# over stages and over columns -- which on this machine left 3398 ULP of
# unearned margin, 41 of 205 (stage, output) comparisons unable to fail on a
# 1-ULP regression, and single elements as much as 10 ULP loose.  Intermediate
# schemes were measured and rejected: budgeting per (stage, output) and per
# (stage, column) and taking the smaller of the two still leaves 1068 ULP and
# only catches 49% of single-element 1-ULP moves, for the same table volume as
# this.
#
# The columns make the physics legible in a way a field-wide scalar cannot:
# QFX/LH lead because ``FLQC*(QSFCMR-QV1)`` and ``XLV*QFX``
# (module_sf_mynn.F:1004-1006) cancel three or four significant digits, and the
# residue sits in the two water columns and ``land_qsfc_unset``.  The rest
# tracks NumPy's float32 exp/log/pow not being the glibc functions gfortran
# linked.  BR, WSPD, TH2, T2, Q2, GZ1OZ0, CPM and ZNT are bitwise everywhere.
#
# These are CPU-reference numbers, so they are the elementwise maximum over
# FOUR measured NumPy profiles. The fourth stays within the unchanged limits
# established by the original three. Their original comparison found 300 of
# 5150 elements -- 88 here, 212 in ``test_mynn_surface_coarse.py`` -- where the
# first three disagreed:
#
#   * Windows NumPy 2.2.6 / CPython 3.13.7, which runs pytest on this box;
#   * WSL Ubuntu-24.04 NumPy 2.4.3 / CPython 3.12.3, which
#     ``tools/mynn_wrf461_oracle/build*.sh`` runs its validators under;
#   * Ubuntu-22.04 NumPy 2.5.1 / CPython 3.12.13 on the second RTX 5090 host.
#   * Ubuntu 26.04 (glibc 2.43) NumPy 2.4.6 / CPython 3.11, the CPU test nodes.
#
# The historical comparisons below concern the original three profiles. The
# fourth combines their already recorded scalar arctan and platform powf
# answers; its surface, coarse and water oracle checks keep every numeric
# limit unchanged.
#
# The public CI's hosted ubuntu-24.04 runner (glibc 2.39) adds no row.  With
# its pinned NumPy 2.4.6 / CPython 3.11 under glibc 2.39, a host without
# AVX-512 gives the 2.5.1 row's answers and an AVX-512 host gives the WSL
# row's; the surface, coarse and water checks hold every limit both ways.
# NumPy 2.4.6 names that dispatch target X86_V4: NPY_DISABLE_CPU_FEATURES
# switches it only when X86_V4 is named, not by the AVX512F..AVX512_SPR names.
#
# The disagreement has exactly two roots, both established against the glibc
# 2.39 functions gfortran linked when it built the oracle -- reached directly
# with ``ctypes.CDLL("libm.so.6")``, and fingerprinted by
# ``test_the_two_platform_dependent_float32_primitives_are_a_known_build``:
#
#   * ``np.arctan`` on float32.  It reaches these tables through
#     ``_psim_unstable_full`` / ``_psih_unstable_full``
#     (woof/core/mynn_surface.py:63-71, :83-85) and so through the whole
#     ``_PSIM_UNSTAB`` / ``_PSIH_UNSTAB`` lookup, which is why the slack sits in
#     the unstable columns -- ``land_qsfc_unset`` and ``free_convective_land``.
#     NumPy 2.5.1 reproduces glibc ``atanf`` bit for bit on all 600060 sampled
#     arguments; 2.4.3 differs on 158548 of them and 2.2.6 differs differently
#     again.  It is the NumPy version, not the SIMD dispatch: forcing 2.4.3 off
#     AVX512 with ``NPY_DISABLE_CPU_FEATURES`` changes not one bit.
#   * ``**`` on float32, which NumPy hands to the platform ``powf``.  Both
#     Linux builds are glibc-exact at every exponent this module uses; Windows
#     gets the MSVC runtime's ``powf`` instead and differs at 2 of the 6006
#     psi-table arguments and at one ``cda`` column of the narrow fixture.
#
# ``np.log`` and ``np.exp`` on float32 are NumPy's own code on all three builds
# and are byte-identical between them, so they are a *constant* contribution to
# the residue rather than a platform axis: each differs from glibc by the same
# amount everywhere.  That is what the rest of these numbers is made of.
#
# So NumPy 2.5.1 is the build closest to WRF, not furthest.  Over the 5150 CPU
# elements this file and the coarse file measure it is 1540 ULP from the oracle
# against 1753 for 2.2.6 and 1866 for 2.4.3, and it is strictly the lowest of
# the three at 281 elements and strictly the highest at 19.  Only 7 of those 19
# clear the older pair's maximum, each by exactly 1 ULP, because at those
# elements the older ``atanf`` error happened to cancel downstream -- a
# primitive being closer to glibc does not make every composed output closer.
# They are the four entries marked ``+2.5.1`` (one here, three in the coarse
# file), and admitting them costs the other two builds 7 ULP of bite in total:
# Windows slack over the 5150 goes 161 -> 168 ULP, WSL 48 -> 55.
#
# A table measured on one platform alone is red on the others -- the
# pre-existing ``validate_coarse_oracle.py`` tables were, and its build script
# had been failing 13 comparisons under WSL before an earlier revision.
#
# These are ratchets: lower them as the FP32 shims are unified, never raise.
#
# HALF UNIFIED (2026-07-26).  The unification this note asked for has happened
# for ``psi_init``'s four lookup tables and only for those: they now build
# through ``woof.core.noahmp_libm``'s ``atanf``/``logf``/``powf`` -- which the
# Noah-MP leaf lanes added after this note was written -- and are pinned by
# ``mynn_surface.PSI_TABLE_SHA256``.  What that measured, over the same 9678
# CPU elements this file, the coarse file and the water file compare:
#
#   distance from the WRF oracle   Windows 2.2.6   WSL 2.4.3   Ubuntu 2.5.1
#     NumPy-built psi tables            3343         (n/m)         2207
#     glibc-transcribed psi tables      1469          1463         1463
#
# and the three builds, which disagreed at 243 of those elements before, now
# disagree at 6 -- all of them ``cda``/``cka``/``psim`` water columns fed by
# the ``**`` and ``np.exp`` leaves this lane did NOT route.  Twelve entries
# were re-measured for it, in ``CPU_ULP`` and ``WATER_ULP``; seven columns rose
# by 1-2 ULP where the old NumPy error had been cancelling downstream, 152 ULP
# of budget came off, and every raised value is identical on all three builds.
#
# The rest of these tables were NOT re-measured and are now knowably loose --
# most of all ``WATER_ULP``'s ``psim`` rows, whose 32/48/32 unstable-table
# residue was the psi tables' error and is now 1.  Closing that is mechanical
# but wants the CUDA halves and ``WRAPPER_ULP`` re-measured on all three hosts
# too, which this lane did not do.  Until then: still ratchets, still never
# raise.

#: What the tables above are a union *of*, made checkable instead of asserted.
#:
#: ``woof/core/mynn_surface.py`` is FP32 arithmetic plus five NumPy elementary
#: functions: ``log``, ``exp``, ``sqrt``, ``arctan`` and ``**``.  Each row here
#: is one build's answer for the four that are not exact, over a fixed 4000
#: point float32 sweep, reduced to the first 16 hex digits of the SHA-256 of
#: the raw little-endian bytes.
#:
#: ``glibc`` is not a NumPy row.  It is
#: ``ctypes.CDLL("libm.so.6").{atanf,logf,expf,powf}`` under glibc 2.39 --
#: the functions gfortran linked when it produced these oracles -- recorded on
#: the two Linux hosts, which agree.  Reading down the ``arctan`` column is the
#: whole finding: NumPy 2.5.1 *is* glibc there and the older two builds are
#: not, so the four ``+2.5.1`` entries above were raised by the *more* faithful
#: build, not by a regression.  Reading down ``log``/``exp`` is the other half:
#: all four NumPy profiles agree with each other and none agrees with glibc, so
#: those two are a constant term in every number above rather than a platform
#: axis.
