"""Does a Noah-MP forecast actually launch the CUDA leaves?

This file exists because the answer has been "no" twice in this repository,
in the neighbouring lane, within a week.  ``woof/core/ruc_gpu.py`` carried
four bitwise device leaves and a bitwise snow-preparation stage, and
``ruc_lsm_step`` called its driver without them, so **every RUC forecast this
project had ever run took the host Python path** at 613 s per d04 land-surface
call while the per-leaf parity gates stayed green and a published 16.8 s figure
described code nothing launched.  The RUC soil ingest had the same shape:
finished, verified, and wired to nothing.

**A timing gate cannot catch it.**  The host path is also correct, merely
slow, so nothing fails -- there is just a number nobody can reproduce.  What
catches it is making the host path *impossible* and requiring the forecast to
survive anyway.

Noah-MP is wired: ``LEAF_BATCH_EVALUATOR`` defaults to the device evaluator
and ``noahmp_runtime`` imports all eight batches.  That is a property of the
tree today, not a law, and it is exactly the kind of property that rots in a
refactor without anything going red.  So:

* :func:`test_a_forecast_runs_with_every_host_leaf_booby_trapped` replaces
  every CPython leaf answer with a raising tripwire and steps a forecast.  If
  any leaf were being answered on the host the step cannot finish.
* :func:`test_the_booby_trap_fires_when_the_device_set_is_withheld` withholds
  the device evaluator from the same call and requires the tripwire to fire,
  so the pass above is evidence rather than a gate that has never been able
  to fail.
* :func:`test_every_device_batch_is_imported_from_the_runtime` reads the seam
  directly: each entry of ``DEVICE_LEAF_BATCH`` must resolve to a function
  defined in a ``woof.core.noahmp_*_gpu`` module.  A batch quietly rebound to
  a host routine would keep every other test in this suite green.
