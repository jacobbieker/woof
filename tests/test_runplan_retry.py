"""Getting back to a working forecast without re-fetching the forcing.

A run that fails after its data is on disk -- at planning, at the
forecast stage, anywhere past the fetch -- used to have no way back
except a fresh run directory and the gigabytes that come with it.
Every stage between the bytes and the failure is create-only, so
re-running the same plan into the same ``output_root`` met the
preparer's "refusing existing output root" and the forecast runner's
"already holds a run's output".

These tests drive the real seams: :func:`woof.runplan._prepare_stage`,
:func:`woof.runplan._clear_forecast_output`, the real
:mod:`woof.stage_reuse` decision, and the real ``_hrrr_chain`` twice
over one run directory.  The fetch half is proven against real fetched
bytes in ``test_a_second_pass_over_a_real_fetched_directory_downloads_
nothing``, which reads the payload a live HRRR fetch left behind rather
than a fixture written to agree with the code.
