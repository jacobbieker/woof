"""A finished ordinary member leaves the card before the next member starts.

Every time-lagged and multi-model member takes the ordinary path: one
original forecast after another on a card. The state and the physics driver
of a finished forecast reference each other, so its arrays stay allocated
until a collector pass. Nothing ran one between members: measured on this
150x150x49 case, the default pool held 620 MB more at each later member's
entry, and the ordinary runner's own admission reads those bytes as taken.
Once that was collected, two process-wide device caches still grew by
27,648 bytes a member: the microphysics ring descriptor tables, kept for the
process although they address one state's arrays, and the Noah tables,
keyed by the parameter object each forecast loads anew.

The gate runs the real session, the real waves and the real prepared-tree
runner on the card, and reads the default pool at each member's entry.
