"""A CPU preparation is admitted against host RAM at every door.

A ``[tiles]`` declaration prepares a GFS forcing on the CPU, so the ingest
phase holds nothing on the card (its device envelope is zero) and its whole
working set is host RAM.  Two figures describe it: the arrays it certainly
holds at once (the floor), which ``woof go`` and ``woof check`` refuse
on, and its estimated peak, which the wizard sizes against
(``tests/test_domain_wizard_resolution.py``) and a verdict reports.  A
machine whose RAM sits between the two is admitted with a warning.  The
domain stays resident under ``mode = "auto"``, so no pinned store is
involved and the preparation is the only host term being weighed.
