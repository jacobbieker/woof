"""``configs/`` ships, because two headline pages send readers to it.

The state this file closes: 97 files in ``configs/``, 0 of them in any
wheel.  ``[tool.setuptools.packages.find]`` named ``woof*``, ``tools`` and
``tilestream*`` and nothing else, so the directory was in no distribution
at all -- and two of the project's most-read pages point at it anyway:

* ``docs/public/VERIFICATION.md`` section 7 reproduces the headline
  Thompson/RRTMG comparison with
  ``woof check configs/real74_thompson_1218z_rrtmg_legacy_4dom.toml``.
* ``docs/public/LES.md`` sends a reader to ``configs/`` for "a real,
  config-driven run" and names the frozen archives under
  ``configs/frozen/`` that the LES receipts are pinned to.

Both instructions worked from a git checkout and from nowhere else.  A
reader who followed the documented install line got a refusal, and the
refusal was the accurate one -- ``woof/verify/cases/_repo_config.py``
already said "``configs/`` is not a Python package and ships in no wheel"
and offered ``--config``/``WOOF_CONFIGS_ROOT``.  An accurate refusal is
still a headline claim nobody can reach.

Where the files land is not incidental.  ``_repo_config`` resolves a
repository config as ``Path(woof/verify/cases/_repo_config.py).parents[3]
/ "configs"``, which inside an install is ``<site-packages>/configs``.
Shipping ``configs`` as a top-level directory of the wheel therefore puts
it exactly where the resolver has always looked, and
:func:`test_the_shipped_configs_land_where_the_resolver_looks` pins that
agreement rather than leaving it to a coincidence of two files.

The measurement runs setuptools' own ``build_py.find_data_files`` against
the real ``pyproject.toml`` -- the same discipline as
``tests/test_package_data_coverage.py`` -- so what it reports is what the
wheel would really contain, and it expands the declared
``packages.find`` include list rather than restating it.
