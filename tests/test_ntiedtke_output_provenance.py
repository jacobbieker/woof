"""Every field Phase 1 is graded on traces to a named producer.

WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is the structural form of a diagnosis rather than
another list (argued by review).

Three times the remaining-work count measured a smaller thing than it
appeared to: "thirteen of thirteen kernels graded" omitted the assembler,
the assembler omitted ``cu_ntiedtke_post_run``. The general form is

    each count was taken over the artifact in front of me
    rather than over the artifact the end condition names.

Phase 1's end condition names ``nt-levels.csv``. So the count must be taken
over **that file's header**, not over a hand-maintained list of categories
-- because a hand-maintained list is exactly what has failed three times.

THIS WOULD HAVE CAUGHT IT ON DAY ONE. None of the eight tendency fields
traces to anything: ``cu_ntiedtke_run`` produces ``pt``/``pqv``/``pu``/
``pv`` and ``zprecc``, and nothing in the tree turns those into
``rthcuten``/``rucuten``/``raincv``/``pratec``. The gap was visible from the
header the whole time and nothing looked at the header.

It is the same shape as every gate here that has worked: the aliasing audit
drives the class-2 test, the ``.inc`` drives the constant table, the kernel
source drives the stage ids. The ones that failed restated a list by hand.
