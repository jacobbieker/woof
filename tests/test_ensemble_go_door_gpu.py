"""The real ``woof go`` door with an ensemble, end to end on a card.

``woof go CONFIG --members N`` runs the whole chain a user types: fetch,
prepare, then the members inside this process under the ensemble session,
with go's own stage observer attached. That is the one route where a stage
observer and the member runners meet, and it had no test that ran it: every
door test mocked the session. The run ended at its first forecast step with
``TypeError: 'GoChainEvents' object is not callable``, after the fetch and
the preparation, and nothing caught it.

The same route is where Ctrl-C used to be held until every member in flight
had finished: the members run in this process, so no supervisor can end
them, and the stop has to reach them at a step boundary.

Nothing is mocked here. The tests need a CUDA card, the provider network
(a small GFS window, cached under ``WOOF_GO_DOOR_OUTDIR`` when that is set)
and the WPS geography tree, and they are gated on ``WOOF_NETWORK_TESTS=1``
like the recipe door's own real-door file.
