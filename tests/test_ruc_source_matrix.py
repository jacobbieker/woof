"""RUC runs from every source WOOF can drive, and the matrix is pinned here.

The claim this file holds is the arbitrary acceptance test applied to one
scheme: **adding a future model must be metadata/table work**.  For the RUC
LSM's soil ingest that means every source in the registry is either

* RUNS -- its declared soil geometry selects a row of
  :data:`woof.ingest.soil_contract.RUC_REMAP_POLICIES`, that row selects an
  arm of WRF's own ``init_soil_3_real``, and a real nine-level float32
  column comes out; or
* a NAMED physical impossibility -- the source does not publish enough soil
  for a 3 m column to exist, and the refusal cites WRF's own line for what
  it would otherwise have to invent.

There is no third answer, and "this source publishes it a different way" is
not one of the two.  The whole matrix is asserted below rather than
described, so a future source cannot be added into a silent refusal: an
adapter with a mapped soil contract that is neither RUNS nor one of the
pinned impossibilities fails this file.

The oracle half is the other guard.  The mapped LAYER route is not a second
implementation of the layer arm -- it is the SAME
``remap_soil_to_ruc_levels`` call the native ERA5/GFS field-name dispatch
makes, and :func:`test_the_mapped_layer_route_reproduces_wrfs_own_numbers`
proves that by replaying WRF v4.6.1's own ``init_soil_3_real`` rows through
the mapped contract path and requiring 0 ULP.
