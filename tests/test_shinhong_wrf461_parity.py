"""Shin-Hong against the byte-unmodified WRF v4.6.1 module, for the first time.

``bl_pbl_physics=11`` is the gray-zone PBL, and until this file existed no WRF
number had ever been produced for it in this repository.
``tools/shinhong_wrf461_oracle/`` drives the pinned
``phys/module_bl_shinhong.F`` (sha256 ``99f44dbe...``) through its own 3-D
``shinhong`` entry on gfortran 15.2.0 -O0 / glibc 2.43 and dumps every input
and output; ``woof.verify.shinhong_ref.np_shinhong_column`` is the float32
NumPy authority, and this module measures the authority against the dump and
pins what it measures.

**The numbers below are a measurement, not a target.**  They record what the
authority actually does, asserted for *equality*, not as an upper bound: an
authority that got better silently is as much a drift as one that got worse.
Every number was produced by
``python tools/shinhong_wrf461_oracle/validate_shinhong_oracle.py`` on
2026-08-03 (Windows 11 x64, CPython 3.13.7, numpy 2.2.6) against the packaged
fixture, and the result is *bitwise* -- max ULP 0 and zero differing bit
patterns, signed zeros included -- on every field of both oracle arms over
every lane WRF's arithmetic defines.  The float64-round-once surrogates for
glibc's correctly rounded ``powf``/``expf``/``tanhf`` never cost a ULP on this
fixture (``pow-probe.txt`` pins 26/26 pow forms bitwise).

Two lane families are excluded from that mask, each asserted separately in
its own test below because it is a documented divergence, not arithmetic:

* case 13's NaN lanes (``rthblten`` all 40 levels, ``exch_h`` k=2,
  ``tke_out`` k>=2, x6 dx).  WRF's own ``prfac2`` 0/0
  (module_bl_shinhong.F:1010: ``15.9*wstar3/ust3`` with both cubes exactly
  zero) writes the column; the authority reproduces the identical NaN
  *geometry*, but the fixture's ES24.16E3 format wrote the sign-less token
  ``NaN``, so the CSV cannot carry the payload or sign (gfortran x86 0/0 is
  0xFFC00000; the parsed text is 0x7FC00000) and bit identity is unknowable
  from the receipt.  Geometry and counts are pinned instead.
The first cut of the fixture accidentally ran case 22 (``kpbl == kte``)
with ``tke_diag = 1``, which makes WRF read ``q2xk(kte+1)`` one past the end
of a ``kts:kte`` array at :1557, and its ``tke_out`` therefore embedded
stack garbage.  The fixture was regenerated with the documented
``tke_diag = 0`` for case 22 (the generator fix is in the same lane), so
that arm is now deliberately fixture-less -- see the oracle README's "Not
covered, deliberately".  The authority still guards the read (``kpbl < kte``
leaves ``efxpbl`` at 0.0, the defined behaviour);
``test_the_oob_tke_arm_is_guarded_and_fixture_less`` pins both the guard and
the reason there is no reference to compare it to.

#: **The table is keyed by the kernel compiler, and that is not bookkeeping.**
#: Every number above is a property of the compiled image, so it is only
#: meaningful next to the NVRTC build that produced it.  Two rows are recorded
#: because this project has measured two, one ULP table each, from a
#: byte-identical ``shinhong.cu``:
#:
#:   13.0.48   The system CUDA v13.0 toolkit, which CuPy resolved on this box
#:             until 2026-08-04.  The certification row: it is what
#:             ``feat(shinhong): CUDA mirror on the RTX 5090`` (58dfd599c)
#:             measured, and what shipped through ArWen 1.6.3.
#:   12.9.86   The pip ``nvidia-cuda-nvrtc-cu12`` wheel, which landed in
#:             site-packages on 2026-08-04 21:47 and which CuPy resolves in
#:             preference to the toolkit from then on.  Measured 2026-08-06.
#:
#: What separates them is ONE site: the ``wscalek`` cube root at
#: shinhong.cu:981.  Under 13.0.48 spelling it ``cbrtf`` instead of
#: ``powf(x, h1)`` moved dv 1491308 -> 46603, tke 2005 -> 2022 and exch_h
#: 9 -> 8.  Under 12.9.86 the same spelling still buys exch_h 9 -> 8 and
#: nothing else: the dv and tke halves of that measurement were properties of
#: the 13.0 code generator, not of the source.  The control is in the
#: evidence: the ``powf`` spelling reads 1491308 / 9 / 2005 under BOTH
#: compilers, so the toolchain did not move generally -- only the one
#: intrinsic did.  Every other field in the table is compiler-independent,
#: including the two ``-ftz`` flush maxima, which are lane counts rather than
#: arithmetic and could not move.
#:
#: 12.8.61, 12.8.93 and 12.9.41 were measured too and all read as 12.9.86
#: does; only the CUDA 13 line produces the certification row.  A build this
#: table has never been measured under is a hard failure with its own message,
#: NOT a silent pass and not an approximate match to the nearest row.
#:
#: **The table is keyed by the card as well.**  Measured 2026-09-18 on
#: a development machine's RTX 4090 (compute capability 8.9, driver 610.57.04, cupy 14.2.0)
#: at the lane/2.7.6-pin-gates tip 221f66f14, with the same kernel, fixture
#: and oracle: the 4090 reads ``el`` 13 where the 5090 reads 14, and every
#: other field the same as the certification row.  That is the CARD and not
#: the compiler, because the 4090 reads the identical table under NVRTC
#: 13.0.48 (build CL-36260728, library sha256 fd8dab02...8559, the
#: certification row's own compiler) and under 13.3.33 (CL-37862127,
#: e51d197b...6750a), two processes each; and the two compilers, which are
#: one site apart on the 5090, produce the same table on the 4090.  So a
#: row belongs to one (build, card) pair: an unmeasured compiler still fails
#: naming itself, and a measured compiler on a card with no row SKIPS naming
#: both, because a gate that fails for the card and not the code prevents
#: no breakage; the release card stage names that skip in its receipt.
#: Receipts: tests/data/receipts/pin-gates/shinhong-ulp-nvrtc13048-*.json,
