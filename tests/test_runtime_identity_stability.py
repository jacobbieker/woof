"""The run identity must name the install, not the process's progress.

``prepared_single_domain_forecast`` snapshots ``_runtime_source_identity()``
when a forecast starts and compares it again at the very END, after the
physics, after the frames are written.  Any part of that identity which
is not a property of the *installation* turns a finished run into

    RuntimeError: forecast runtime implementation changed during run

``wheel_record_identity`` carried one such part: ``record_unhashed_count``
counted every RECORD entry with no digest, and pip's RECORD lists
``__pycache__/*.pyc`` with no digest.  Bytecode materializes lazily, so
the count grows as the process imports modules.

Measured on the shipped 1.4.0 wheel on a fresh `pip install recast-woof[all]`,
one process importing the package tree:

    imported 276 modules
    DIFFERS: installed_wheel
        record_unhashed_count 109 -> 358

and a 474x378x49 forecast died on it at the end of a 5-minute run, twice,
whenever bytecode was not already warm -- which is the new-user path.

Bytecode is DERIVED from the source these digests already bind, so it is
excluded outright rather than counted.
