"""A resumed forecast draws its first new hour's rainfall from the saved history.

Breakage prevented: a 120 hour GFS forecast resumed at hour 24 published 96
temperature pictures but 95 qpf_1h and 95 qpf_total, because the hour-24
frame saved beside the checkpoint was never given to the render as context
(and a context frame from another folder was not joined to the new series);
the first-products receipt still said complete.
