"""The tornado-LES attempt #1 config must keep matching what was ruled.

The ratifications are prose in
``docs/superpowers/specs/P6-LES-DECISIONS-RATIFIED-2026-08-05.md``, the
geometry is numbers in the TOML, and nothing else connects them. This
file is the connection: it runs the case module's own audit, and adds
the mutation controls that prove the audit can fail.

Two cases are covered. ``les_tornado_mayfield_20211210`` is the live one
that attempt #1 runs; ``les_tornado_dodgecity_20160524`` is PARKED behind
an unadjudicated ingest question and is held to the same structural
standard so a future attempt starts from a config that still means what
it meant when it was ratified.
