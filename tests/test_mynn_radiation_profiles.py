"""MYNN you can run overnight: the radiation-bearing MYNN family.

Until 1.8.7 every shipped MYNN suite ran shortwave with longwave OFF.
That is a DAYTIME validation configuration -- ``PHYSICS.md``'s nocturnal
validity table listed all three MYNN rows under "nocturnally valid: no",
and ``woof.experiment.build_experiment`` refuses an undeclared one for
any window containing local night -- so a user who chose MYNN from a
menu landed in the nocturnally-invalid class with no MYNN row to move
to.  Composing MYNN with radiation by hand was always accepted; what did
not exist was a NAMED suite, and every menu, ``--physics-profile`` choice
list and route declaration is keyed by name.

Three rows close it, one per land surface the no-radiation family
covers.  This file pins what they are FOR:

* each loads through the front door every runner shares and resolves to
  MYNN 5/5 with both radiation streams on;
* each is nocturnally valid, proved against the shipped guard on a real
  48 h window that contains local night -- and its no-radiation sibling
  is refused on the SAME window, which is what makes the first half a
  measurement rather than a guard that cannot fire;
* each differs from that sibling in the radiation block and nothing
  else, so a paired run isolates radiation;
* the MYNN option identity is untouched by all of it.
