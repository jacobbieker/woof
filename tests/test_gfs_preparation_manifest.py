"""Preparations started in parallel from one GFS download keep their own
front-door manifest.

The manifest binds a preparation's own namelist, experiment and bridge by
sha256, and the front door verifies it when it starts and again when it
publishes.  Every preparation from one download used to write the one
``<download>/gfs-input-manifest.json``, so a second preparation started
from that download replaced the first one's binding while the first was
still preparing, and the first then failed with "GFS input manifest SHA
mismatch".  Both doors that author the manifest for a preparation (the
prep door with ``--source-manifest`` omitted, and the ``woof go`` chain's
manifest stage) now write it beside that preparation's output root.
