"""The Mu/W fusion trial's source audit, held against the installed kernel on a CPU.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS
--------------------------
``woof/ensemble/batch_acoustic_fusion.py`` builds one joined column kernel
from the text of the acoustic Mu and W bodies, under a counted audit: three
column intermediates, a closed set of index forms, and a fixed number of Mu
stores.  The audit is a guard, and a guard that has gone stale refuses a
kernel that is fine.  That happened at the 2.8.5 staging tip.  2.8.4
(a11786408) gave ``advance_mu_th_msf`` a strict and a default body side by
side in one conditional block and gave ``advance_w_phi_msf`` a forcing row
named ``kr``.  The audit read the raw text, counted both arms (2, 4 and 6
stores against the audited 1, 2 and 3) and refused every map-factor domain:
21 device tests red, in files no battery list ran, so nothing reported it.

Everything the audit decides is decided from text, so it is asked here
without a card.  The installed kernel must be admitted, and a kernel whose
compiled stores, index forms or store ownership really changed must still be
refused.  The device files (``tests/test_ensemble_batch_acoustic_fusion_gpu.py``
and its dycore sibling) hold the words; this file holds the admission.
