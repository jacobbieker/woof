"""The plain render door answers a `mesh:` or `xsec:` term itself.

WHAT BREAKAGE THESE PIN (gate law).  Three families do not come from the
store, and the renderer refuses each of them for the WHOLE invocation,
before it draws a single picture (`rw-wrfbatch/src/main.rs`): a `mesh:`
term with no `--mesh-grid` is refused at argument validation, a `mesh:`
term beside store products is refused at the entry to the batch render,
and an `xsec:` term with no `--section` is refused before the store
render starts.  So one such term forwarded from this door costs every
other requested product its pictures, and `woof render --products
composite_reflectivity,mesh:cell_area` exited 1 with no pictures at all
where it could have drawn every reflectivity frame.

Both doors of this product answer such a term the same way, per PRODUCT
rather than per invocation, because the renderer's own answer is the
per-invocation one and no door can afford to pass it on: the plain
`woof render` door drops the term before it launches the renderer, and
the `woof downscale` door drops it before the child integrates so the
finalize render draws what the request left.
