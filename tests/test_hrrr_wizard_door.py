"""The wizard's closing block for ``--source hrrr`` names the shipped door.

`woof domain --source hrrr` ends with the commands a reader is meant to
run next, and until now those commands were the route's INTERNALS:

    python -m tools.prepare_hrrr_wrf ...        <- a path a wheel has not got
    python tools/hrrr_single_domain_benchmark.py ...
    python -m woof.hrrr_hierarchy_direct ...
    python -m woof.prepared_domain_tree_forecast ...

Every one of those is a program `woof prep`/`woof sim` already spawn --
MEASURED with `woof prep --source hrrr ... --dry-run`, which prints the
composed line verbatim.  So the wizard was handing a reader the machinery
behind two shipped commands, two of the four spellings do not exist in a
pip install at all, and the two `<printed by ...>` digest placeholders it
told them to fill in are values `woof sim` reads off the bundle itself.

`woof go`'s hrrr refusal and `woof sim`'s "finished but unbindable"
refusal ALREADY spell the real route.  Three hand-written copies of one
route is the defect class here, so the assertions below are about a
single helper: the wizard and both refusals render from it, and a fourth
copy cannot be added without failing a test.
