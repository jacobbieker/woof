"""A checkout's bytes are the committed bytes, for everything hashed.

git-for-Windows defaults to ``core.autocrlf=true``.  Without a
``.gitattributes`` saying otherwise, a Windows clone rewrites LF to CRLF
on checkout, so a file in a clone and the same file in a wheel are
different bytes.  That is invisible until something hashes them -- and
this product hashes a lot of them:

* ``_runtime_source_identity`` in both prepared-forecast runners binds
  the SHA-256 of the model sources it is about to run;
* the Thompson physics receipt binds its implementation files;
* the preparation proof binds an export-source set, and the forecast
  stage re-derives it and compares.

A mixed estate -- ``rw-wps`` from a pip venv, the runner from a fresh
clone -- therefore failed with ``proof export source hashes differ from
preparation``.  Nothing was corrupt; the two halves had different line
endings.

The remedy is ``* -text`` in ``.gitattributes``.  The gate is this file:
it asks git for the committed blob and compares it with what is on
disk.  On a Linux runner it is nearly tautological; on a Windows runner
it is the actual check, and Windows is where the failure lives.

# the whole class.  Measured: across all 127 commits that touched
# `woof/physics_registry_v2.json`, not one blob has ever carried a CR
# byte, so no amount of blob-reading could ever have caught it.
#
# The damage is a digest split rather than a merge.  The 52
# `woof/authorities/*.json` are in this class, and `packaged_authorities`
# in `woof/source_authorities.py` resolves each one, takes
# `hashlib.sha256(path.read_bytes())` OFF DISK, and raises `packaged
# <profile> <role> authority hash differs` when it does not match the
# pinned contract -- as does `packaged_contributing_mappings` beside it.
# A CRLF working-tree copy is a different digest, so it raises, on a
# machine whose blobs are all correct.  The prepared-forecast proof
# re-derives its export-source digests from disk in the same way, which
# is the `proof export source hashes differ from preparation` that
# `.gitattributes` was written to prevent -- while every blob-reading
# gate above stays green on the machine that caused it.
