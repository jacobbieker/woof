"""Every CUDA kernel source pinned by SHA-256, ONE TEST NODE PER MODULE.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS
--------------------------
The 2026-08-28 fault-injection audit disabled a physics process in a CUDA
kernel -- WSM6 rain accretion of cloud water, ``pracw = 0.0f * fminf(...)`` in
``woof/core/kernels/wsm6.cu`` -- and ran the ENTIRE 172-file stage-1 leg
twice, pristine and injected, one pytest process per file:

    pristine tip : 37.5 min, 12 files rc!=0, 13 failing node ids
    injected     : 36.8 min, 12 files rc!=0, 13 failing node ids

Zero files differed.  Zero test node ids differed.  Time to detect: never.

Two separate causes, and this file addresses both.

1.  ``tests/test_mp8_frozen.py`` holds the digests, and it is NOT on
    ``tools/battery/stage1_files.txt``.  The list's own header (line 1026)
    says why: nine kernel modules had drifted from ``FROZEN_MODULE_DIGESTS``,
    so the file is red, and "a known-red file on a per-cut list buys a red
    battery, not a fixed test".  The same header writes "a frozen digest
    nothing checks is not a freeze."

2.  Even run directly it does not DISCRIMINATE.
    ``test_every_frozen_kernel_module_is_unchanged`` collects every drifted
    module into one dict and asserts once, so under the injected fault it
    fails with the IDENTICAL two node ids as the clean baseline.  Only the
    assertion message grows a key.  No exit code, no node id, no count moves.
    An already-red aggregate gate has stopped being a gate.

This file is the same claim at ONE NODE PER MODULE.  A tenth module going
red is a new node id, visible in the count and in the summary, whether or not
the other nine are red.

Measured on this tree at b47a400a5 (and identically at 659962929, the
published 2.5.8 tip): 56 of the 65 pinned modules still match
their historical freeze; nine have moved, each in a named commit, and are
re-pinned below to the bytes they now carry.  Re-pinning is not loosening --
every one of the 65 is pinned to a specific digest, and the drift is written
down with the commit that caused it, which is the amendment discipline the
repository already uses for a stale gate table.  Nothing here is exempt and
nothing here is skipped.

It hashes 91 text files.  It compiles nothing, imports no kernel and needs no
CUDA device.

    #     are deleted with it.

    #     same fzu_override gf_deep_stage and gf_shallow_stage already
    #     expose.  The shipped forecast passes 0 in all three; the parity
