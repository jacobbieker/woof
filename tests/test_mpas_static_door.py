"""The static half of what ``woof mesh`` delivers.

A grid file alone reaches no dycore. The mesh registry that admits a mesh
to a run pins BOTH the grid and a matching static by byte count and

These tests hold the door to emitting the pair, hold the refusals to
naming that breakage, and bind the Python-side ABI literal to the one the
Rust binary actually prints.
