"""The wrfout write path runs on the Rust classic writer BY DEFAULT.

2.5.0's law is that data-path processing is Rust; the product tape is the
data path's most important artifact.  These tests pin the flip itself:

* the DEFAULT engine is ``rust`` -- no flag, no env, a bare
  ``WrfoutWriter`` writes the classic (CDF-2) container through
  ``woof.io.nc_writer_bridge``;
* the Python/netCDF4 engine remains reachable ONLY as an explicit escape
  (``WOOF_WRFOUT_WRITER=python`` or ``engine="python"``), documented as
  a workaround, and still writes exactly what it always wrote;
* a box where the Rust library is missing gets a refusal that names the
  concrete breakage and both remedies -- never a silent engine downgrade,
  which would change the product tape's container with build state.

The dual-write equivalence of the two engines is proved separately in
``tests/test_wrfout_dual_write.py``.
