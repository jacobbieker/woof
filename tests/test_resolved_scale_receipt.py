"""The disclaimer receipts stay bound to the tree they describe.

A committed receipt that nothing re-checks is a snapshot of a claim, not
evidence for it: edit the docs, leave the JSON alone, and the receipt now
describes a tree that no longer exists.  These tests re-measure the
essential fields against the live tree, so drift fails the build rather
than ageing quietly.

The internal half is checked here too.  The performance-gate sentence is
only allowed to be written in a release-excluded file, so the exclusion
line and the sentence's own vocabulary are both gates, not notes.
