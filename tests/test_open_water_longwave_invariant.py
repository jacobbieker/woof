"""Over open water, one surface call must not be able to see GLW at all.

THE CLAIM UNDER TEST.  The shipped account of the v1.6.2 nocturnal-dewpoint
collapse is a longwave-deficit story: a frozen 300 W/m2 downward longwave
cools the skin, the skin's saturation humidity collapses with it, and the
2 m dewpoint follows.  That mechanism runs through a LAND-SURFACE energy
budget.  Over open water woof has no such budget in the surface call: the
SFCLAY kernel derives the surface endpoint from TSK and PSFC alone
(``kernels/sfclay.cu:255`` -- ``qs = EP2*es/(ps/1000 - es)`` for every
non-land column), and TSK over water is prescribed rather than predicted.

So the marine surface call has NO PATH from GLW to the published moisture,
and the invariant is exact rather than approximate: hold everything fixed,
change ONLY the declared longwave, run ONE surface call, and QSFC, QFX, Q2
and TSK must be bit-identical.  Not close -- identical.

WHY BIT-IDENTITY IS THE RIGHT BAR.  A tolerance-based version of this test
would pass on a tree where GLW leaks into the marine path through a small
term, and that leak is exactly the implementation defect worth finding.  Any
difference at all names a variable that moved and is reported as a finding.

WHAT A FAILURE WOULD MEAN.  If a field does move, the shipped causal story
is not merely incomplete for water columns, it is wrong about the mechanism,
because the moisture would be responding to longwave through a route nobody
has described.

WHY THE CARRIER CONTRACT ADMITS THIS CONFIGURATION.  This run selects
Noah with radiation fully off, declares GLW as a constant and never
writes SWDOWN -- on a land domain the contract would refuse it, and
should.  Here the domain is ALL WATER, so Noah consumes exactly zero
cells and there is no consumption for an unsourced SWDOWN to corrupt.
The contract counts the consumer's cells with the runners' own land/ice
predicate before refusing (consumer-cell awareness,
woof/core/radiation_carriers.py), which is what lets this invariant
EXECUTE rather than skip or die at the seam.  One land cell in this
domain restores the full refusal; the contract suite pins both
directions.
