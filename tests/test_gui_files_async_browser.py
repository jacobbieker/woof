"""Files shows the pictures of the folder picked last, and says so when a folder's list cannot be read.

The defects: picking a folder asked the server for its picture list and drew
whatever answer came back, so a slow answer for the folder picked first
replaced the pictures of the folder picked after it while the second row
stayed marked as picked.  A list that failed drew nothing and said nothing;
the page kept the last folder's pictures, or none, with no reason and no way
to ask again.

The shipped Files page runs in headless Chrome (or Edge) against the real
page server; the forecast and its picture lists are answered by the test.
