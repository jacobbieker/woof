"""The executor's loop holds nothing per step.

The 2026-09-15 VRAM-growth lane found no leak in the engine: on the 5 h
nested pair the forecast process sat flat at 8.2-8.6 GB (NVML
per-process) while a second process filled the card.  This pin holds the
executor to that going forward: with a dycore step that allocates
transient arrays on every call, and a history handler that
receives every frame, the number of live NumPy arrays and the bytes they
hold, read after each root step once the loop is warm, must not move.
A per-step accumulation anywhere in ``execute_experiment`` -- a retained
history frame, a validation copy kept for a later pass, a diagnostic
appended per period -- would show as a rising series here.

CPU tier: the host-only fixture of ``tests/test_model.py``; the same loop
runs the CuPy state on the card, where the receipt's ``cupy_pool_used``
and NVML per-process peaks carry the equivalent reading.
