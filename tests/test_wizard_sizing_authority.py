"""`woof domain` must size without CuPy, and say where its budget came from.

The 2.5.0 persona walks measured the breakage this file pins: the wizard
is command 1 of the README's two-command forecast, and it refused EVERY
box without CuPy -- including a caller who had already declared the card
with ``--card`` -- because the sizing estimator's import chain pulled
``woof.core.physics``, whose module body imports cupy.  The refusal it
printed was a package-presence check naming an install line, for a
command that integrates nothing on a card.

The fixed contract, which these tests hold:

* ``--card <tier>`` / ``--vram-gib N``: size against the declaration and
  never touch cupy or the device.
* neither flag: MEASURE the local card through the short-lived probe
  subprocess (the measured-thresholds rule -- a real number beats an
  assumed tier), and say so on stdout.
* neither flag and nothing to measure: refuse by naming the real choice
  -- declare the card or make it measurable -- never with a package
  check for a dependency this command does not use.

The two subprocess tests run the REAL CLI in a real interpreter whose
``sitecustomize`` makes cupy unresolvable to both ``find_spec`` and
``import``, which is what a CPU-only wheel install looks like.
