"""Three ways ``woof doctor`` told a reader something untrue.

Each test here is anchored to a measured incident, not to a shape:

* A staged ``~/.woof/bridges`` left over from an older release passed
  every probe doctor had -- the launch probe and the ABI marker both
  answer yes to bytes that predate the release -- so doctor printed a
  green estate and the first ``woof prep`` refused, rc 78.  Doctor
  must check what the routes RESOLVE against the bytes this release
  pinned, which is exactly what ``woof fetch-bridges`` checks.
* ``python -m woof.doctor`` exited 0 having printed nothing: a module
  with no ``__main__`` guard is a door that silently answers "no gaps"
  to a reader diagnosing a broken install.
* The report arrived in one block after seconds of silence, with no
  statement of what was being probed while the reader waited.
