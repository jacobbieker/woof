"""P3 (mp_physics=50) is a configuration a user can name, and it radiates.

THE BREAKAGE THESE GATES PREVENT
--------------------------------
P3 merged correct and fast -- a CUDA port measured against WRF's unmodified
``phys/module_mp_p3.F`` -- and then sat unreachable, in two separate ways
that no existing gate could see:

1. NO PROFILE SELECTED IT.  ``SINGLE_DOMAIN_PHYSICS_PROFILES`` carried
   sixteen suites and not one chose mp=50, so there was no configuration a
   menu, a ``--physics-profile`` flag or a route declaration could name.
   That half is CLOSED on this line: ``P3_LEGACY_RRTMG_PROFILE_ID`` ships,
   is on the wizard's choice list, and is the profile every gate in
   section 3 below binds.  The gates stay because the property they pin --
   a scheme reachable from the doors a picker actually asks -- is what
   regressed, and a suite can fall back out of any of those tables.

2. NEITHER RADIATION ARM COULD RUN IT.  ``cloud_optics_scheme(50)`` raised
   (no row in ``_MP_CLOUD_OPTICS_SCHEME``), and the config-time refusal
   that hid this named ``ra_rrtmg_variant='rrtmg_legacy'`` as the way
   through -- an arm that ALSO raised, from
   ``legacy_scheme_declares_radii(50, 1)``, at the first radiation call.
   Both shipped P3 configs named that dead remedy.  ``woof check`` returns
   0 without ever calling radiation, so the green check on those configs
   was not evidence of anything.

Every gate below fails on the tree that had those defects.

THE WRF AUTHORITY, IN ONE PLACE
-------------------------------
Read on a stock WRF v4.7.1 tree whose ``phys/module_mp_p3.F`` hashes to the
same ``716950a3081ec4e338c9a918d26ec80f7ee0e40b3e284283f070423237f6a3c6``
the Fortran oracle pins; v4.6.1 line numbers second where the text moved.

* ``Registry/Registry.EM_COMMON:3043`` (v4.6.1 :3038) --
  ``package p3_1category mp_physics==50 -
  moist:qv,qc,qr,qi;scalar:qni,qnr,qir,qib;
  state:re_cloud,re_ice,vmi3d,rhopo3d,di3d,refl_10cm,th_old,qv_old``.
  No ``qs`` in ``moist`` and no ``re_snow`` in ``state``: one ice category
  spans the snow-to-graupel continuum through rime mass and rime volume.
* ``phys/module_physics_init.F:1018`` (:1017) puts P3_1CATEGORY in the
  ``use_mp_re`` disjunction that sets ``has_reqc = has_reqi = has_reqs = 1``
  at :1022-1024 (:1021-1023); :1027-1034 (:1026-1033), commented "for P3,
  to ensure correct coupling with predicted effective radii", then sets
  ``has_reqs = 0``.  The row is 1, 1, 0.
* ``phys/module_radiation_driver.F:3879-3887`` (same lines in both) is
  cal_cldfra1's P3 arm: ``IF (F_QI .and. F_QC .and. .not. F_QS)`` gives
  QCLD = QI + QC and weight = QI/QCLD.
* ``phys/module_ra_rrtmg_lw.F:12250-12261`` and
  ``phys/module_ra_rrtmg_sw.F:10851-10863`` (same lines in both) remap the
  species under ``has_reqs == 0 .and. has_reqi /= 0 .and. has_reqc /= 0``:
  ``inflg = iceflg = 5``, ``resnow1D = MAX(10., re_ice*1.E6)``,
  ``QS1D = QI3D``, ``QI1D = 0.``, ``reice1D = 10.``
