"""``woof render`` matplotlib-engine product tests -- CPU-only.

These pin the matplotlib engine explicitly: they are the fallback
engine's product contract, and must hold identically whether or not
the rust renderer is built (tests/test_render_rust.py covers that
engine and the auto selection).

The fixture is written by the project's own ``WrfoutWriter`` (WRF
dimensions, attributes, and Times records), so the file under test is
what ``woof run`` produces, and the wrf package (pip ``wrf-rust``) reads
it exactly as it reads a production frame.  Assertions check that the
requested PNGs exist, are non-empty, and decode to plausible image
dimensions -- not that any pixel is pretty.
