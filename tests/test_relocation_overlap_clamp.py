"""The overlap floor is a BOUND on a move, not a verdict on the run.

``check_admissible`` has always judged two things: how far a move goes in
parent cells, and how much of the child it keeps.  The runner clamped a
proposal to the first and not to the second, so a follow source that
proposed one cell too much ended the forecast instead of making the move
it was allowed to make.

The two bounds are also not independent.  Overlap is separable -- a shift
of ``(m, n)`` parent cells keeps ``(1 - m*r/nx) * (1 - n*r/ny)`` of the
child -- so the binding case is the DIAGONAL move, and a floor ``f``
admits a per-axis magnitude of only ``1 - sqrt(f)`` of the nest's own
width in parent cells.  A configuration is free to write the two numbers
separately, and the shipped cyclone preset wrote 8 parent cells against a
floor of 0.7 on a nest 40 parent cells wide, whose floor admits 6.  Its
own maximum was therefore unreachable, and a storm that asked for it
ended the run.

What this file pins:

* the arithmetic, on both axes and both signs;
* the derivation, against the numbers every shipped configuration ships;
* the clamp: the largest move in the same direction that clears the
  floor, with the null move as the always-available floor of the walk;
* the receipt: the proposed shift, the applied shift, and the bound that
  cut it;
* the refusal that remains, for a caller that names a placement rather
  than following one.
