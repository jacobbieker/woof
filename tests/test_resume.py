"""``woof resume`` locate/parse tests -- CPU-only, no forecast is run.

The fixture checkpoints are genuine-format NPZ files: the same
``__gpuwm_restart_header__`` JSON member and array-manifest layout
``write_restart`` produces, so ``read_restart_header`` and
``validate_manifest_checkpoint`` -- the REAL machinery -- adjudicate
them.  What is faked is only the payload (two small arrays instead of a
model state); the identity checks that consume the payload belong to
``run --restart`` and are exercised by the restart family, not here.
