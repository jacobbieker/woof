"""These tests name ``--engine matplotlib`` wherever they assert the
matplotlib suite's own filename grammar.

`woof enprod --engine` defaults to ``auto``, which takes the Rust
``rw_ensbatch`` on a checkout that has built it -- so a test asserting
``refl-ens-mean_d02-3km_<stamp>.png`` is asserting a property of one
engine and has to say which.  ``tests/test_enprod_rust_engine.py`` covers
the resolver and the rust route.

``woof enprod`` ensemble product tests -- CPU-only.

The mathematics tests are deliberately hand-computable: a probability
over five members is a fifth, and a test that only checks "roughly 0.6"
would pass for an implementation that divided by the wrong count.  Every
probability assertion here is an exact equality against a number worked
out on paper in the test body's comment.

The rendering tests use the module's own synthetic-ensemble generator
(:func:`woof.da.enprod.write_synthetic_ensemble`), so the files under
test are written by the project's ``WrfoutWriter`` and read by the
mandated ``wrf`` package exactly as a production ensemble would be.
