# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# These rows are what emptied `mapped_engine_bridge.ENGINE_GAPS`: the
# member door (`woof prep --source 20crv3`) now runs through
# `decode_composed_source` like every other composed source, so the two
# gates that used to hold it back are asserted HERE, on the real private
# member bytes, against both engines:
#
#   * ENSEMBLE IDENTITY.  The 20CRv3 PDT carries no member
#     (`member_identity` in the sealed manifest is
#     `filename_memNNN_not_grib2_pdt`).  The verified filename member is
#     therefore an EXPLICIT binding in the composition input manifest
#     (`member` + `member_identity`), and the composition -- Rust engine
#     and Python engine alike -- stamps it onto every canonical frame and
#     into the sealed alignment receipt.  A run that lost it would return
#     frames with `member=None` for an ENSEMBLE source, which is what the
#     pre-port measurement showed and what the row below refuses.
#
#   * PRODUCT IDENTITY.  `_verify_archive_inventory` binds the exact
#     every-member GRIB2 product identity (center/subcenter/table
#     versions, generating process 4/195, GDT 0, scan mode 0x40, shape 6,
#     0.5-degree, DRT 0, contiguous field indices).  Its measurement
#     instrument on the bare default is the engine's raw record-inventory
#     surface (`gpuwm_mapped_engine inventory`); on the documented
#     Python-engine workaround it is still `grib2_inventory`.  The gate's
#     own wording is identical either way, which the rows below assert
#     instrument against instrument.

    The gate is only as strong as what feeds it, so the two instruments
    are compared column for column on a real member file -- the record
    keys the gate counts, and every authority/grid/packing octet it
    pins.  A silent disagreement here would let one engine's route pass
    a contract the other refuses.
