"""``-m "not gpu"`` must open no CUDA device.  This proves it, per module.

The exclusion used to depend on authors writing ``@pytest.mark.gpu`` by hand.
Five Noah-MP CUDA modules did not, gating only on
``pytest.importorskip("cupy")``, and an unmarked test is not excluded by
``not gpu`` -- so a run believed to be CPU-only compiled and ran 34 CUDA gates
on a machine whose owner had asked that no GPU work happen there.

``conftest.pytest_collection_modifyitems`` now applies the marker
automatically.  These tests exist so that automation cannot be quietly removed
or narrowed: they assert the property (*no cupy-importing test survives
``-m "not gpu"``*) rather than the mechanism, so they keep working if the
mechanism is rewritten and fail if it is deleted.

The *detector* checks are pure source inspection.  The *selection* checks are
not, and the docstring used to claim otherwise.  They shell out to ``pytest
--collect-only`` once per module, deliberately with ``GPUWM_NO_LOCAL_GPU``
stripped, and several CUDA modules probe the device at import time -- one
``pytest.importorskip("cupy")`` plus ``getDeviceCount()`` at module scope, and
``pytest.skip(..., allow_module_level=True)`` when it throws.  So these tests
do open a device, at one remove, and their answers depend on this host having
one that answers.

That is why a module which skips itself at import is now reported as
*unanswerable* rather than as a marking failure: with the card saturated,
``getDeviceCount()`` does not return cleanly, the RRTMG modules skip at
collection, and the gate used to read zero-selected as "this coverage runs on
no machine" and go red -- on a busy card, at a release cut, pointing at a merge
it had nothing to do with.

    ``_collect(tests/test_acoustic.py, "not gpu")`` is the probe behind
    ``test_no_device_touching_test_survives_the_not_gpu_selection``: it asks
    whether any device-touching test survives the CPU selection.  Every test
    in that file is device-touching, so the right answer is *none survive*,
    and pytest says exactly that -- ``no tests collected (11 deselected)``,
    exit 5, which this helper's caller has always accepted.

    ``tests/conftest.py`` registers the battery's zero-collect guard on every
    run, by design: a guard that runs only when somebody remembers ``-p`` is
    not a default.  The guard sees a file named on the command line that
    contributed nothing, prints its banner and rewrites the session's exit
    status to 1.  The caller then read 1 as a crashed collection and this
    gate went red on a correct answer.

    asked about, only when pytest's own ``no tests collected`` line is there
    (so the session really did end with an EMPTY selection rather than a
    partial one), and only when nothing in the output says the collection
    errored or that a census floor was missed.  A crashed collection prints
    none of that and is still refused, which
    ``test_a_crashed_collection_is_still_refused`` holds line by line.

    The guard itself is untouched.  On a battery leg it still fails by name,
    which is what caught ``pytestmark = pytest.mark.gpu`` retiring sixty RUC
    bitwise-oracle tests.  This probe is not a leg: it is a
    ``--collect-only`` question about ONE file under a deliberately narrowing
    ``-m``, so it reads the guard's verdict instead of dying on it.

# the second property: cupy ABSENT, and the marker one indirection out
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Everything above is about OPENING A DEVICE.  There is a second question the
# AST detector cannot answer and, until 2026-09-17, nothing did: can this
# selection be COLLECTED at all on an install that has no cupy?
#
# It could not.  Measured on a development machine in a venv with no cupy extra,
# ``-m "not gpu and not slow and not network"`` over the CPU battery lists
# ended in ``Interrupted: 6 errors during collection`` and ran NOTHING, and
# seven further tests were collected and failed with ModuleNotFoundError --
# five in tests/test_experiment.py and two in
# tests/test_physics_md_aerosol_claims.py, none of which names cupy in its own
# source.  They reach it through ``woof/core/physics.py`` and
# ``woof/core/mynn_pbl_runtime.py``, one indirection out, and a detector that
# reads only the module's own source is structurally blind to every one.
#
# WHY THE REMEDY IS NOT "MARK THEM gpu", which was the first thing tried.  The
# closure below flags 26 test modules whole and 120 more in part; none of them
# opens a device, and ``gpu`` implies a skip wherever local GPU work is banned,
# so marking them would retire that coverage on the very machine that runs the
# CPU battery.  Over-marking is coverage loss wearing a safety costume, in this
# file's own words.  The tree's own position is the opposite one:
# ``tools/battery/provision_battery_venv.ps1`` installs the ``all`` extra for
# the CPU legs and says in writing that stage-1 files import cupy at
# collection.  cupy is PROVISIONED there by design.
#
# So the remedy matches the property: when cupy is ABSENT the conftest does not
# import a module whose import closure needs it, and skips by name a test whose
# body reaches one.  When cupy is PRESENT -- every battery leg -- not one item
# changes.  The tests below pin both halves, and the one that matters most is
# the closure going PAST the module's own source, because that is the blindness
# the whole item is about.
