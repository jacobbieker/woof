"""A SOURCE distribution never carries one platform's native binaries.

Measured on the 2.5.0 Linux shakeout at 0f45dcfec: running ``python -m
build`` after ``tools/stage_wheel_bridges.py --platform linux-x86_64``
swept every staged native ELF artifact into the sdist -- the 18 the
declaration carried at that commit, 20 extra members under
``gpuwm-2.5.0/woof/libexec/bridges/``, the tarball up from
95,236,252 B to 114,906,421 B, and a *source* distribution shipping
Linux executables.  The published shape survived only because
``.github/workflows/publish.yml`` happens to run ``--clean``
immediately before ``python -m build``; nothing in ``setup.py``,
``MANIFEST.in`` or the backend made the wrong build fail, so every
local or non-CI build of a staged tree produced it.

Two mechanisms close it, and they answer different questions:

* ``MANIFEST.in`` prunes the staged directory, so the sdist's declared
  SHAPE has no room for platform binaries however it is built.
* ``setup.py`` refuses ``sdist`` on a staged tree, because the prune
  alone would silently mislead: ``python -m build`` builds the wheel
  FROM the sdist it just made, so a pruned sdist would hand the wheel
  build a tree with no staged artifacts and produce a ``py3-none-any``
  wheel while the operator was staging for a platform one.

Both directions are proven -- the refusal on a staged tree, and an
ordinary sdist still building from a clean one -- against the real
``setup.py`` and the real ``MANIFEST.in``.
