"""The RUC_NZS tier on the card.

``tests/test_ruc_nzs_tier.py`` proves the nine-level translation unit did not
change, on the CPU, three ways.  This file asks the remaining question, which
only a device can answer: **does compiling through the tiered loader change
the numbers?**

That is not the same question.  The CPU proof compares the source the
UNSPECIALIZED loader assembles against the pre-lift source.  It says nothing
about the arm of the mechanism a six-level run actually takes -- the
``#if RUC_NZS == 9`` ladder as seen by NVRTC with a define injected, the
derived ``RUC_NZS_M1/M2/M3/DTDZS_LEN`` macros, and the ``#if``-selected
``__constant__`` table.  So the gate here runs the whole 43-field driver
comparison with the tier FORCED ON at the shipped geometry: same count, other
code path.  Max ULP 0, or the ladder is not inert.

This is the closest substitute for a six-level forecast oracle that exists on
this machine.  It validates the MACHINERY at a geometry that HAS an oracle,
which leaves only the geometry itself untested -- see
``docs/wrf_ruc_runtime_admission.md`` for what that does and does not buy.

The file then asks the *other* half, which nothing else here asks: at SIX
levels, do the host lane and the device lane agree?  They are line-for-line
transcriptions of the same Fortran, so agreement cannot detect an error
present in both -- but a disagreement is a transcription error, and the
first run of that comparison found one.  ``ruc_soil_finalize`` computed
``dzstop`` from a hardcoded ``0.01f - 0.0f``, WRF's nine-level
``zsmain(2) - zsmain(1)``, and at six levels returned grdflx -337.1 W m-2
where the host returned -67.4 -- a factor of exactly 5, which is
0.05 / 0.01.  Nothing in the tree could have seen it: every other RUC gate
runs at nine, where the literal is right.  That is what this comparison is
for, and it is why "it compiles at six" was never the claim to make.
