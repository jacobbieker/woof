"""The cloud-overlap boundary: icld 4/5 exists, and nothing shipped selects it.

``woof/core/rrtmg_mcica.py``'s ``_stochastic_cdf`` grows an exponential
decorrelation profile for ``overlap in (4, 5)``, and it does that through
``_expf32`` -- a Python ``for`` loop over a raveled float32 array, one
``expf`` per element.  A Python loop on a forecast's per-timestep radiation
path would be a defect of exactly the kind the Noah-MP cold start was.

It is not on a forecast path, and this module is what says so rather than
leaving it to a reader's grep.  ``overlap`` is ``int(icld)`` and ``icld`` is
``int(cldovrlp)``, so the question is entirely "can a user deliver
``cldovrlp`` 4 or 5 to the legacy RRTMG adapter", and the answer is no at
four independent gates:

* **No config key.**  ``cldovrlp`` is not a ``RunConfig`` field, so an
  experiment TOML carrying it is refused by name at load.
* **No namelist import.**  A WRF 4/4 namelist declaring ``cldovrlp = 4``
  is refused rather than imported (``woof/namelist_import.py``).
* **No adapter admission.**  ``RRTMGLegacyRadiation._check_pins`` refuses
  every value but 2 before a forecast starts.
* **Not the code that runs anyway.**  The shipped adapter hands the batch
  preps the DEVICE twins, whose ``MCICA_DEVICE_ICLD`` is 2 and which fail
  closed on anything else; the NumPy generators (the only reader of
  ``_expf32``) are the paired scalar authority, reached from tests.

There is no environment variable and no flag that reaches overlap 4/5.  The
only caller is a direct Python call to
:func:`woof.core.rrtmg_mcica.generate_lw_subcolumns` /
:func:`~woof.core.rrtmg_mcica.generate_sw_subcolumns`, which is what the
last test here does -- so this file also proves the branch still WORKS,
i.e. the verdict is "unreachable in production", not "quietly broken".
