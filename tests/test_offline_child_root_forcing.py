"""One rule, one sentence, every door: the offline child's root forcing.

THE DEFECT THIS PINS.  "the run's root takes specified boundaries" was
spelled TWICE, in two different wordings -- ``woof/offline_child_run.py``
said "child config must set specified=true and nested=false" at admission,
``woof/offline_child.py`` said "standalone offline child requires
specified=True and nested=False" in the state builder -- and fired at
NEITHER plan-review door.  ``woof downscale --dry-run`` never read
``cfg.nested`` at all, so the earliest a reviewer could learn that a
``nested = true`` child config was unusable was after the real run had
started, and the second copy landed only after the whole parent archive
had been interpolated.  Neither sentence named a breakage.

Now one function owns the rule, all three doors call it, and it fires at
plan review.

WHY TWO IMPORTS SIT INSIDE TEST BODIES BELOW.  The proof this file exists
to carry is that the FIRST test is red on the base commit for its own
reason: ``--dry-run`` exits 0 and says nothing.  Importing
``OFFLINE_CHILD_ROOT_FORCING_REFUSAL`` or
``require_offline_child_root_forcing`` at module level errors the whole
file at COLLECTION on that commit, which reports as one collection error
and proves nothing about the defect.  So the names this change adds are
imported by the tests that need them, and the front-door test imports
only what the base already has.  Do not lift them back to the top.
