"""The multi-moment analysis contract, pinned by the cycle that broke it.

A rung-2 real-radar LETKF cycle updated nine fields --
``('thp','qv','u','v','qc','qr','qi','qs','qg')`` -- on a Morrison
two-moment state.  Reflectivity assimilation created hydrometeor mass in
cells the background had left clear, the number concentrations stayed at
the background's exact zeros, and Morrison's slope closure evaluated the
resulting pairs to NaN.  Reflectivity OmA for that analysis was not
recoverable.

The tests here reproduce that signature end to end with the real filter
and the real reflectivity mirror, and then require it to be unreachable
through the module that writes an analysis.
