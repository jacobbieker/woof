"""The plan-time advisory for an adaptive nest whose step may grow fast.

The breakage it names: a 500 m child at max_step_increase_pct = 51 took a
freshly measured CFL after an output alarm, grew to about three times its
spacing rule and went non-finite hours into a nested forecast; the same
forecast at 5 percent completed at the same pace.  The advisory must fire
for exactly that configuration and stay silent for every other one.
