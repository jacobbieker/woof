"""A source that cannot reach the domain is refused BY THE FRONT DOOR.

The refusal itself has been complete for a long time: it names the first
uncovered corner, the source index it maps to, and the window the source
actually covers -- enough to tell a crop that is too small from a source
whose grid does not reach the target, which have opposite remedies.  What
was missing is ownership.  The preparation adapters called the interpolator
with no handler, so a correct refusal arrived as ``ValueError`` at the end
of ten lines of internal call stack (measured 2026-08-17: a regional
European source against a central-US domain, ``woof prep`` rc=1, one
``Traceback`` header, ten ``File ...`` frames).  A user reads the internals
of ``horiz.py`` before the sentence that tells them what to do.

The breakage these tests prevent: a preparation front door -- including the
one a NEW model gets for free through the mapped route -- relaying an
internal traceback instead of the refusal it already wrote.
