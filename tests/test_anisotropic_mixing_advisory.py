# tests/test_anisotropic_mixing_advisory.py
"""The closed form of the anisotropic-mixing exposure, and its advisory.

``tests/test_anisotropic_mixing_w_stability.py`` measures the thing on
the card: with ``mix_isotropic = 0`` the horizontal diffusion of ``w`` is
handed the VERTICAL exchange coefficient, which is built and capped on
the layer depth, and past ``K*dt/dx^2 = 1/4`` an explicit Laplacian
amplifies the 2-grid-interval mode instead of damping it.

Here is the same statement in closed form --
``mix_upper_bound * (dz_max/dx)^2`` against 1/4, a ratio ``dt`` cancels
out of -- and the load-time warning built on it.  CPU only, and
deliberately in its own file: the measurement's helper opens a CUDA
device, which marks its whole module ``gpu``, and a criterion this cheap
should still be checked on a machine that has no card.

Generic throughout: the criterion is grid geometry, not a case.
