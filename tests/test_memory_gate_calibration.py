"""The Windows memory gate prices what a measured card actually does.

The 2026-08-19 GPU walk on a 10 GiB RTX 3080 (Windows 11, WDDM desktop
resident) measured the defect this file pins.  ``woof go`` predicted a
9.91 GiB peak envelope for a 110x88x49 single-domain 12 km forecast --
``footprint 5.66 x 1.75 WDDM floor`` -- against a 7.12 GiB budget and
refused.  Forced through, the machine-wide peak was 5,925 MiB over a
3,227 MiB desktop baseline: the run's own contribution was about
2.6 GiB, UNDER the budget by more than 4 GiB.  Both the footprint
projection and the 1.75 multiplier were fiction on this card, and the
refusal's printed remedy (``woof domain --vram-gib 8``) itself refused
at every size, because 78% of the floored envelope was grid-independent.

The calibration that replaces it: six whole bare-default forecasts on
the 3080 (60x48 to 240x192, rte-rrtmgp and legacy-RRTMG suites),
machine-wide nvidia-smi at 0.25 s beside the runtime's own
GpuPeakMemoryWatcher receipts.  Measured: the itemized estimate tracks
the CuPy pool at 0.95-1.0x on the rte-rrtmgp lane; the machine-wide
peak minus the desktop baseline lands at estimate + the itemized
non-pool residency, within -0.20..+0.95 GiB; the one positive-residual
lane is legacy-RRTMG pool retention, proportional to the estimate
(worst +0.30x).  Receipts:
``docs/public/receipts/wddm/rtx3080-wddm-calibration-20260819.json``
and the walk capture in the RTX 3080 walk capture.

What ships, and what this file holds:

* ONE envelope.  ``envelope_platform`` no longer switches model by card
  size, so the wizard (which knows the card) and ``woof check`` /
  ``woof go`` (which measure the machine) can never price the same
  bytes with different formulas -- the open task #162 mechanism.
* The Windows envelope is the measured affine form: estimate + itemized
  non-pool + the measured unmodelled constant + a WDDM pool-slack term
  proportional to the estimate.  No 1.75 multiplier, no 5090 pool
  constants in the intercept.
* The walk's exact configuration passes ``woof check`` against the
  walk's measured machine state.
* Refusals are true: the wizard's no-layout-fits refusal ranks lighter
  profiles by the estimator's PRICED envelope (the walk's refusal named
  legacy-RRTMG suites that measure 2.1x heavier), and ``woof go``'s
  refusal stops pointing at a ``--vram-gib`` recursion that cannot
  succeed while keeping its measured free-VRAM accuracy.
