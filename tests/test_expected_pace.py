"""The pace a plan will run at, stated BEFORE the run starts.

THE DEFECT.  A user drew a 399,119-column domain on a 10 GiB card.  The
engine priced it correctly, chose the streamed road correctly, and told
the user nothing at all about what that road COSTS.  Streamed at that
size is seconds-to-minutes per model step, so a three-hour forecast is
many wall-hours -- and the way the user found out was by watching a run
that looked stalled.  Every memory figure in the estimate document was
right and the one number that would have changed the decision was
absent.

Two halves are pinned here.  The first is that ``run-plan --estimate``
and ``woof check`` both carry an ``expected_pace``: which road, how
many seconds per model step, how many wall seconds for the plan's own
``run_seconds``, and WHERE THE NUMBERS CAME FROM.  The second is the
column bound ``K`` -- the largest domain that still fits the resident
road on this card -- computed from the SAME pricing
``tilestream.autoplan`` makes the stream/resident decision with, so the
advice and the decision cannot disagree.

CPU-only.  Every fixture pins its tiling and declares its VRAM budget,
which is exactly what ``streaming.decide`` does with a configured
``vram_budget_bytes``, so no card is consulted anywhere in this file.
