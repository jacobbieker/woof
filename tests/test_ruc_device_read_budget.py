"""How many times one RUC call on the card makes the host wait.

The profile of record (50 warm root steps of the 299x299 + 282x129 pair on a
5090) measured 3,206 blocking device-to-host reads per root step, each one a
stream synchronisation, and attributed 2,839 of them -- 89.8 per cent -- to
the RUC land-surface scheme: about 568 per call, five calls per step, almost
all of them admission checks reading one field at a time.

Two changes removed them, and both funnel through a single function each, so
counting those two functions counts the synchronisations this scheme now
initiates:

* ``ruc_validation._host_list`` -- the ONE read that resolves a whole batch
  of admission tests, however many fields the batch holds;
* ``ruc._selected`` -- the ONE read that turns a dispatch arm's boolean mask
  into column indices, after which every gather and scatter through that arm
  is free.

The CPU-tier model in ``tests/ruc_device_read_counter.py`` puts the total for
a warm production-shaped grid at 22 reads inside ``woof.core.ruc``, of which
5 belong to host leaves a forecast does not run, plus roughly ten batch
flushes in the device leaves: about 27 against the 568 measured before.

**Taken on a card, 2026-09-15, an RTX 5090**, 4,096 columns per call:
**17 reads without snow** (12 batch flushes, 5 arm conversions) and **28 with
snow** (17 and 11).  The model was right to within one read of the snow case,
and the scheme now costs 17 to 28 reads per land-surface call against about
568, so RUC stops being 89.8 per cent of a root step's device-to-host reads.

The bound is set from that measurement rather than from the loose 60 it
carried while no card had printed a figure.  It is not set AT 28: the arm
conversions are one read per dispatch arm that has work, so a column mix that
lights more arms than this fixture's legitimately costs a few more.  40 is
the measured worst case plus that margin, and it is still fourteen times
below what the scheme cost before.  The test PRINTS what it finds, so a
future shape that approaches the bound is visible before it trips it.
