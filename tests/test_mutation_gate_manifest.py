"""The mutation gate's two lists stay readable, accurate and narrow.

WHAT BREAKS WITHOUT THIS
    tools/battery/run_mutation_gate.py is expensive enough that nobody
    runs it to find out whether its manifest still parses.  Three
    concrete breakages, each of which has a sibling that already
    happened in this tree:

    * A package listed in tools/battery/mutation_gates.txt that no
      longer exists, or that lost its test leg in
      tools/battery/cargo_gates.txt.  cargo-mutants reports 100%
      survival for a package with no tests, and 100% survival printed in
      a matrix reads like a catastrophic finding when it is an absence.
      Worse in `block` mode: every mutant in it is fresh, so the gate is
      red for a reason that has nothing to do with the commit.

    * A debt line in tools/battery/mutation_survivors.txt whose file no
      longer exists, or whose package is not on the gate.  A debt entry
      that outlives its code is amnesty granted to nothing, and it hides
      the fact that the hole it recorded was never closed -- the same
      way a stale _CRLF_DEBT entry would.

    * The debt list growing without anybody deciding to grow it.  The
      list is a work list; a widening is a ruling.  This test pins the
      shape so a widening is visible in review as an edit to a file
      whose header says what an edit means, rather than as a number that
      moved.

    None of this needs a Rust toolchain, which is the point: the checks
    that can run without cargo run in the ordinary pytest battery, and
    the run that needs cargo is a separate leg.
