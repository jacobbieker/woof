"""The fetch launches a Zarr reader that speaks this tree's contract, or refuses.

A reader staged in the user bridge directory by an older release still
launched, and refused every ARCO ERA5 request with
``level: source units "Hectopascal(hPa)" disagree with declared units
"hPa"`` although this tree's reader reads that spelling through its
units table.  Its record schema had not changed, so the old contract
marker let it through.
