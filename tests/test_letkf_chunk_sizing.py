"""The LETKF chunk sizing model and its out-of-memory degradation path.

Pinned at the geometry that failed in the field.  On 2026-08-05 the
Level-II A/B sweep's three single-radar arms all died at the same place:
``letkf.py``'s eigenvalue check, with ``cudaErrorMemoryAllocation``, on a
card with roughly thirty gigabytes free.  The retired heuristic priced
only the member-slot arrays, called its budget "not a hard limit" in its
own docstring, and from ``--memory-budget-mib 6144`` chose 7248-point
chunks against an 1845-slot single-radar stencil -- while the three-radar
arms (3 x 1845 = 5535 slots), sized by the same formula to 2421 points,
solved twice the observation load on the same card without incident.

What this file pins:

* the sizing arithmetic at exactly that shape -- the budget is a ceiling
  the chosen chunk provably stays under, and the 7248-point choice cannot
  recur from the same inputs;
* the ceiling the card imposes, which outranks the budget when the two
  disagree, and the refusal that names whichever of the two actually
  bound;
* the degradation path -- a device allocation failure mid-analysis halves
  the chunk and re-solves the same span instead of failing the analysis,
  bit-identically here on the host and to a few ulp on a card, for the
  reason the relevant test states;
* the refusal -- raised by name, with the remedy and the required figure
  in the message, only when even a single gridpoint cannot fit.

No cupy import anywhere in this module, deliberately: the sizing
arithmetic is pure, the degradation driver is exercised through numpy
with synthetic allocation failures, and ``tests/conftest.py`` auto-marks
any cupy-importing module as ``gpu``.  The on-device counterpart lives in
``tests/test_letkf_chunk_sizing_gpu.py``.
