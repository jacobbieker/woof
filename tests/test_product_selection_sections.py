"""A product list is read term by term, with each section's level list whole.

Breakage these prevent, each measured on a real 3 km frame with the Rust
renderer: ``all,xsec:cloud:QCLOUD/wa`` drew 67 maps and no section, without
a word; two sections with the same level list lost the second list's last
level, so its colour bar spanned 0 to 1 g/kg instead of the requested 0.01
to 0.1; and a level list closed by an overlay (``0.1/wa``) became a store
product the renderer refused, so the invocation drew nothing at all.
