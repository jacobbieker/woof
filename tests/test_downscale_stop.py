"""Stopping a downscaled child is recorded as a stop.

WHAT BREAKAGE THESE PIN (gate law; all three present in 2.7.7).

* A SIGTERM left no record.  SIGTERM, which ``woof downscale`` tells
  its reader to send when Ctrl-C cannot reach it, had no handler on this
  route.  The child died at the default disposition (exit 143) with no
  event, no ``report.json``, no banner and a run manifest carrying only
  its start, so the folder read as a run still going.
* A Stop was published as a failure.  The desktop and terminal Stop
  (SIGINT to the process group) was published as a failure named
  ``KeyboardInterrupt: KeyboardInterrupt``, with ``result`` FAIL and a
  banner saying "Why it stopped: KeyboardInterrupt".
* Staging files were counted as pictures.  The renderer shared the
  child's process group, so the same Stop killed it between drawing its
  pictures under the engine's flat staging names and filing them, and
  the child then published and counted 155 to 171 flat ``rustwx_wrf_*``
  and ``var_wrf_*`` files as its pictures.

Each test starts the real engine door (``woof.offline_child_run.main``)
in a subprocess with a stub stepper in place of the CUDA forecast and a
stand-in renderer that stages and files its pictures the way ``woof
render`` does (``tests/downscale_stop_worker.py``), stops it the way the
desktop, the terminal app and a shell do, and reads what it left.
