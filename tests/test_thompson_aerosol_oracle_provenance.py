"""The mp=28 column oracle must stay re-derivable from its stated inputs.

The aerosol-aware sibling of ``tests/test_thompson_oracle_provenance.py``,
and it exists because of what that file found.  The classic mp=8 oracle was
self-contradictory for four waves: ``p_pa`` and ``pii`` are built in
``run_column.F90`` from ``z`` alone, inside a loop that never reads the
scenario id, so every fixture sharing a ``dz`` must agree on them exactly --
and three did not.  The cause was not a different machine, which is what the
mp=8 freeze receipt had recorded.  From GCC 12 on, ``-O2`` implies
``-ftree-vectorize``; a vectorised ``exp``/``pow``/``log`` loop links glibc's
libmvec SIMD entry points (``_ZGVbN4v_expf``, ``_ZGVbN4vv_powf``,
``_ZGVbN2v_exp``, ``_ZGVbN2vv_pow``, ``_ZGVbN2v_log10``) in place of the
scalar routines, libmvec is not bit-identical to scalar libm, and whether a
given loop vectorises is a cost-model decision that depends on how much
UNRELATED source surrounds it.  ``run_column.F90`` was 227 lines when three
fixtures were generated and roughly a thousand when the other 43 were.  The
harness merely growing changed the oracle's numbers.

``run_column_aero.F90`` builds its base state the same way (``p0*exp(-z/8000)``
and ``(p/p0)**rd_over_cp`` at :231-232, ``max(1e-5, 0.014*exp(-z/2500))`` at
:273) and ``build_aero.sh`` used the same bare ``-O2``.  Same exposure.

WHAT WAS MEASURED HERE, and it is the reassuring half.  The aerosol deck was
rebuilt from an unmodified WRF v4.6.1 checkout with ``-fno-tree-vectorize``,
on the toolchain ``README-AEROSOL.md`` records -- GNU Fortran 13.3.0
(Ubuntu 13.3.0-6ubuntu2~24.04.1), Ubuntu 24.04, glibc 2.39, one RTX 5090 box
-- and ALL 49 committed CSVs plus ``tnccn_act_native.bin`` came back BYTE FOR
BYTE identical.  A control build at plain ``-O2`` on the same machine linked
``_ZGVbN2v_exp``, ``_ZGVbN2vv_pow`` and ``_ZGVbN4vv_powf`` and was refused by
the new guard, so the vectoriser really does reach this harness; it simply
never reached the arithmetic these fixtures record.  The deck was correct by
where the cost model happened to land, exactly as the mp=8 lane predicted, and
``-fno-tree-vectorize`` is what converts that from luck into a property.

Four promises, the first three the same three the classic file holds.
