"""Each domain's acoustic substeps follow its own terrain.

A generated 500 m forecast over the central Andes (steepest slope 0.89)
ran four acoustic substeps per step and its surface w passed 200 m/s at
model second 40; six substeps ran the same forecast for the hour.  These
tests pin the derivation that picks the count from the ground and the
routes that apply it; tests/test_steep_terrain_step.py pins the stability
it buys through the production step().
