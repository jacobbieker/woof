"""The nest divide must not collapse a child's step to arithmetic.

WHAT THIS PINS, and it was found the expensive way.  A nest's step is the
largest divisor of its parent's tick count at or below what its CFL asks
for.  When the parent's tick count is poor in factors, the smallest
divisor at or above the ceiling is enormous, and the child gets a step
hundreds of times smaller than it requested.

MEASURED on a 10 / 2 / 0.667 km tree with lattice 15: a root of 5595
ticks is 15 x 373, so d02 took 1119 = 3 x 373 -- whose only divisors are
1, 3, 373 and 1119.  d03 asked for about 1 s, the smallest usable divisor
was 373, and it ran at 0.03 s taking 373 substeps inside one parent step.

The failure mode is what makes this worth a file of its own: the run does
NOT fail.  It slows by the factor -- 11.5 model-seconds per wall-second
fell to 0.23 -- and from outside that is indistinguishable from a
controller responding to a violent flow.  Every field was healthy while
it happened: max |w| FALLING 38.7 -> 23.0 m/s, cells over 20 m/s falling
1145 -> 62, surface pressure moving 1.5 mb in two hours.  It was read as
a diverging storm before the fields were checked.

Two defences, and they are different in kind.  The root is snapped to a
SMOOTH tick count so the quotients have interior divisors to adapt along;
and a substep count far past the grid ratio is REFUSED, because slow and
silent is the worst way for this to fail.
