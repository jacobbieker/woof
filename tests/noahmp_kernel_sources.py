"""Shared source-scan pieces for the Noah-MP CUDA kernel gates.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS

``tests/test_noahmp_sflx_cuda.py`` and ``tests/test_noahmp_water_cuda.py``
each opened with two checks that read the ``.cu`` text and need no device at
all -- the SC_/OU_ layout agreement, the "this kernel has not grown a
column" claim, and the WATER file's own imported-section drift check, whose
docstring says in as many words "That test needs no GPU and runs
everywhere."

It did not.  Both files carried a module-level ``cp =
pytest.importorskip("cupy")`` PART WAY DOWN, under a "device" banner, and a
module-level skip is not local to the section it is written under: it fires
at import, so the CPU checks defined above it were skipped too.  On top of
that ``tests/conftest.py`` marks a module ``gpu`` in its entirety when a
cupy import appears at module scope, so under ``GPUWM_NO_LOCAL_GPU=1`` those
same checks were deselected a second time, for a second reason.  Four CPU
tests, on every box, on every cut, collected zero -- the same class as
``tests/test_first_products.py``'s line-568 skip.

The fix is structural rather than clever, because ``conftest``'s rule is
correct and must not be worked around: device tests live in a module that
imports cupy at module scope, source-scan tests live in a module that does
not.  This module holds what both halves read, so the split costs no
duplicated constant -- which matters especially for ``SCALARS`` and
``OUTPUTS``, whose entire purpose is to be ONE spelling of a layout.
