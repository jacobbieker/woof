"""Domain trees on run-plan's prepared route.

The last unwired route.  ``woof go`` refuses a multi-domain config by
construction -- that is the refusal a nested GFS launch hit -- so
run-plan asks it not to and swaps exactly ONE stage: the tree runner
binds a single preparation receipt where the single-domain runner binds
three proof digests.  Preparation itself does not branch at all; rw-wps
reads the domain count out of the config and builds a hierarchy.

Everything here is CPU-only.  The two runners are stubbed at the
observer seam, and the receipt relay is exercised against real files on
disk, because the relay IS the work: both digests are sha256 of an
artifact's bytes, and a test that mocked the hashing would be testing
nothing.

    tree would not merely be low, it would be IDENTICAL, and every
    inequality below is the nest being priced.

    It reads that way because it stopped being able to read the earlier
    way.  The original cell compared the two plans' peak-to-allocation
    RATIOS at ``--vram-gib 24``, which worked only while both fits ran up
    against the same budget: two budget-saturated layouts have the same
    peak, so the one carrying a nest necessarily allocates less
    underneath it and its ratio is the larger.  The point-fit extent cap
    (``woof.domain_wizard.POINT_FIT_MAX_EXTENT_KM``) ended that.  A
    point carries no extent, so the fit chooses one, and since 2.7.3 it
    stops at 6,000 km per axis rather than at the card: on 24 GiB the
    single-domain fit now stands at the cap with 11.70 GiB of a 24 GiB
    card priced, while the tree still fills the budget, and the ratio
    inverts with nothing wrong.  The ratio was never the property anyway
    -- it is arithmetic that happens to follow from one -- and it is not
    stable in the direction of a smaller card either (measured
    2026-09-10 on this fixture: it holds at ``--vram-gib 12`` and
    inverts again at 8).

    A budget above the cap is what makes both fits land on the same
    root, and it is the same 500 x 400 at 12 km from 48 GiB up
    (measured 2026-09-10 at 48, 64, 96 and 128 GiB: every figure below
    is identical across all four).  The cell asserts that equality and
    the cap behind it rather than assuming them, so a moved cap fails
