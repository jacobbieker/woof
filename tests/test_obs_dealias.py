"""Region-based dealiasing: what it recovers, and what it refuses to guess.

Every case here is one where the truth is known by construction, because a
dealiasing test that cannot state the right answer is only testing that the
code runs.  A synthetic field is folded at a known Nyquist, the unfolder is
asked to recover it, and the assertion is against the pre-fold truth --
exactly, not approximately, because unfolding is integer arithmetic and an
answer that is close is an answer that is wrong.

The adversarial half matters more than the recovery half.  The three cases
:mod:`woof.obs.superob` names as beyond its masks -- a spatially coherent
fold with no gate-to-gate jump in its interior, a couplet straddling the
Nyquist, and a region isolated from any reliable reference -- each get a
test, and in each the demanded outcome is either the true field or an
explicit refusal.  Never a plausible number.
