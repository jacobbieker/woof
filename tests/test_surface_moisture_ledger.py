"""The ledger is tested against known answers in BOTH directions.

An instrument that only ever reports "clean" on clean input has proven
nothing: it would report clean on broken input too.  Every check below comes
in a pair -- a healthy column that must land inside the FP32 budget, and the
SAME column with one known defect injected that must light up one named
ledger column and leave the others alone.

The four injected defects are the four ways the v1.6.2 nocturnal-dewpoint
story could have been wrong:

* wrong provider  -- the causal story named a writer that is not the writer
* stale carrier   -- a radiative carrier frozen at its seed value
* broken CQS2     -- the moisture exchange coefficient corrupted
* TD conversion   -- the product chain's dewpoint formula wrong

These run on the host: every function under test is FP64 arithmetic over
published FP32 values, so none of them needs a card.
