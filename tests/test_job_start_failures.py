"""A job or a remote forecast whose program cannot start ends with a result, and a stop ends what it stops.

The defects this file holds shut:

- The job wrapper raised when the command it runs could not be started (its
  program gone, its folder not there) and wrote no result: the job read as
  running until its wrapper was found dead, with no reason anywhere.
- A Machines node's supervisor died with a traceback when the engine's
  Python had been removed: the job kept its "waiting" state and the page's
  follower waited on a supervisor that was gone.
- An engine that answered neither Ctrl+C nor SIGTERM after its bound held
  the card for another hour; it now gets SIGKILL after a second grace.
- A run told to stop whose engine then exited 0 read Finished.
