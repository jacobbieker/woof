"""``[tiles] mode = "auto"`` never streams a domain in tiles too small to run.

THE DEFECT (measured 2026-09-26).  A 206x204x49 3 km GFS
domain on a 10 GiB RTX 3080 with about 4 GiB free missed its resident
admission budget by 0.3 GB.  Auto dropped the planner's redundancy limit
and streamed it anyway, in 1,190 tiles of 6x6 with halo 18 -- 49.95x the
necessary work -- and the only record was a plan warning no surface
printed.  Each 15 s step took 237-547 s; the same forecast with tiles off
ran at 0.6-1.9 s per step on the same busy card and finished in 98
minutes.  The review had promised 0.45-1.2 s per step, because the pace
model priced the domain's columns and the bus, and neither the halo work
nor the per-tile cost of 1,190 tile sweeps.

What is pinned here, CPU only, on the recorded configuration and card:

* auto never returns a streamed plan past
  :data:`tilestream.autoplan.MAX_REDUNDANCY`, at any free memory;
* where the card's measured free memory holds the resident envelope, auto
  runs it resident inside the external margin and says so, which is what
  the tiles-off run that finished did;
* where it does not, auto refuses before the run, in plain words, with the
  numbers and the ways out;
* the pace model quotes the runs its per-tile ends were fitted from back
  to themselves, which checks the arithmetic, and brackets every
  streamed step measured on runs that took no part in either fit, which
  checks the model;
* a streamed plan states its tile size, tile count and redundancy on the
  review, the estimate document and the run log's line.
