"""Development probes and beside-the-code test suites never ship.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS, measured on the 2.7.0 candidate's artifacts:
all three woof wheels and the sdist carried 42 ``tilestream/test_*.py``
pytest suites (``test_gate.py`` alone 136,872 B) and the six
``tilestream/skeptic_*.py`` fault-injection probes at import top level,
and the sdist carried ``tests/test_n5s_toolchain.py`` although
RELEASE-EXCLUDE.txt drops it from the public tree with the campaign
harness it imports.  Two declarations LOOKED like they handled it:

* ``[tool.setuptools.packages.find] exclude = ["tilestream.skeptic*"]``
  matches packages, and there is no package by that name; the probes are
  modules directly under ``tilestream/``.
* ``prune tilestream/skeptic`` in MANIFEST.in names a directory that does
  not exist.

Neither mechanism can name a MODULE, so the wheel half is a ``build_py``
filter in setup.py (``DEVELOPMENT_MODULE_GLOBS``) and the sdist half is a
``recursive-exclude`` in MANIFEST.in.  Both halves are measured here
against the real setup.py and the real MANIFEST.in, the way
tests/test_sdist_excludes_staged_bridges.py measures the staged-binary
prune, and RELEASE-EXCLUDE.txt's test entries are checked against the
sdist so the public tree and the sdist cannot disagree about a test.
