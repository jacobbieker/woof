"""A prepared tree crossing platforms is the same tree.

Origin: a tree prepared on Windows could not be run on Linux.  The
preparation records the paths it actually opened, and on Windows those
strings carry backslashes.  Every receipt check that read one back through
``pathlib.Path`` got the RUNNING platform's separator rules: on POSIX a
Windows spelling has no separators at all, so ``.name`` returns the whole
string and every basename comparison fails.  The refusal that came out
said the receipt "differs from supplied file", which blames the bytes --
and the bytes were identical, digest and all.

These tests are platform-independent on purpose: each spelling is asserted
against both readings, so a green run on Windows is a green run on Linux.
