"""``StormTracker.locate`` -- where the storm is, with no side effects.

The tracker's job splits cleanly in two: find the vortex, then decide
whether that is worth a move.  Only the first half is of any use to a
consumer that is not the mover -- the track writer wants a position, not
a proposal -- and asking for one through ``desired_shift`` would burn a
cooldown, leave a decision receipt, and change where the nest goes.

So ``locate`` is the first half, extracted, and this file pins the two
properties the extraction has to have:

* **One implementation.**  ``desired_shift`` is ``locate`` plus
  hysteresis, so a run's deck and its nest cannot disagree about where
  the vortex was.  A second centre-finder that drifted from the first is
  exactly the failure ``[relocation.containment]`` was shaped to avoid
  ("two trackers can disagree and fight").
* **No side effects at all.**  No receipt, no cooldown anchor, no
  hysteresis state.  Calling it a hundred times between cadences must
  leave the next ``desired_shift`` byte-identical to the one that would
  have happened had nothing called it -- that is what lets the track
  writer emit oftener than the nest moves.
