"""Every New Tiedtke stage must run under ONE launch geometry.

The column workspace is per-block and lane-interleaved, so a column's slots
belong to one ``(block, lane)`` pair for the whole stage sequence.  Launch
one stage on a different threads-per-block or grid and that column resumes
on a different lane, reading another column's state.  Nothing crashes and
every number stays finite.

This is the one guarantee with no analogue in the Fortran -- no comparison
against the reference can catch it -- and it is the one most likely to be
broken deliberately, because this project's culture is kernel performance
work and ``ntiedtke_cutypen`` sits at 91 registers.  Someone will want to
re-tile that stage for occupancy.

So it is enforced three ways, and this file is the third:

1. ``NtLaunchGeometry`` is frozen and built once per step.
2. ``NtStages`` methods take no grid or block argument, so there is no
   per-stage override to reach for.
3. Every kernel REPORTS the geometry it actually observed and refuses to
   compute when it disagrees -- so a launch routed around the launcher
   turns into a loud parity failure instead of a silent cross-column read.
