"""The native reader's validation of a history file, the route a Windows Unicode path takes, on any machine.

On Windows a history file under a folder with non-ASCII letters is checked
through the native reader, because the NetCDF-C open path there cannot open
it: a valid Unicode frame failed its reopen and was quarantined as damaged.
The Windows cases are in test_wrfout_unicode_recovery.py; these send an
ASCII file through the same native route so the checks and the quarantine
rules are held wherever the reader is built:

- a complete frame passes every check (inventory, shapes, Times) and is kept;
- a frame the reader refuses as input, or one without its completion mark,
  is quarantined;
- a reader that crashes, times out or answers nonsense says nothing about
  the frame: the error is raised and the frame is left where it is.
