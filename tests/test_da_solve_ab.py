"""The solve-device A/B harness, tested against known answers both ways.

CPU only.  Nothing here needs a card: the point of these tests is that the
harness reports a real difference as a difference and reports NO difference
as a fault, which is checkable without ever running the device arm.

The trap this suite exists to close is the one an A/B harness fails
silently at.  A comparison that prints "max difference 0.0" reads as
"the two arms agree" and is far more often "the treatment never ran" --
a flag that was never forwarded, a device arm that fell back to the host
path.  So the negative control is tested as hard as the positive one:
two host arms MUST come back bitwise identical, and a judge handed that
pair MUST refuse to call it agreement.
