"""The executable bit on the README's first command is essential.

v1.0.0 shipped `install.sh` as mode 100644.  `./install.sh` -- README
line 1 of the install section -- answered `Permission denied` on every
fresh Linux and macOS clone, which two independent first-time-user
pilots hit within their first minute (ARWEN-NODE1 B1, ARWEN-NODE2 PP-6).
NTFS has no POSIX mode bit and this repository is developed on Windows,
so nothing about the working tree can catch a regression: only the git
index records the mode, and only a check on the index sees it.
