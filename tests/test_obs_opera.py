"""The European radar composite route: wrapper, descriptor, source class.

Three layers, each tested where it can be tested accurately:

* the front-door descriptor and the argument construction, against the
  wrapper alone -- no binary, no socket;
* the pack round trip, against bytes this file builds the way the Rust
  writer does;
* the built binary's own ``--abi`` and its refusals, when a checkout has it.

The decode itself is the Rust side's and is tested there, against the
transcribed geometry of a live frame. What this file must not do is restate
that decode in Python and then assert the restatement agrees with itself.
