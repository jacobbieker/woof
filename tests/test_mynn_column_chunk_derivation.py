"""The MYNN column width is the swept optimum, and the card's answer is kept.

``mynn_dmp_mf_columns`` is 52% of all GPU time in a quiet root step of the
299x299x59 + 282x129 pair, and it launches 128 blocks of 128 threads -- on a
170-SM card that is 42 SMs given nothing, one block on every SM that gets
any, and 4.7% of the card's resident thread slots, against a register file
that admits three blocks per SM.  So the width was derived from the card
instead: the largest chunk whose blocks still fit in one wave, clipped by
what the card's memory admits, never below the 16,384 columns 2.7.4 shipped.

**Then it was measured, and the derivation lost its own sweep.**  Ten arms on
an RTX 5090 at nz = 59 on 2026-09-15, sole tenant, 200 root steps of
the pair's prepared control leg per arm, two passes with the second in
reverse order (``tools/mynn_chunk_sweep/summary.txt`` and
``sweep.tsv`` beside it, written by the harness in that directory):
the quiet root cycle rose with every widening, 0.5263 s at 16,384 columns
against 0.6252 s at 65,536, with no knee anywhere between.  The width the
derivation picks on that card, 65,280, is 18.8% slower and costs 2.9 GiB
more scratch.

**And that sweep had only looked one way.**  It started at the width 2.7.4
shipped and only ever widened, so all it could find was a direction, and it
ranked its own narrowest arm first.  Ten more arms the same evening, same
card, same prepared leg, same protocol, running downward: 0.4450 s at 8,192
columns against 0.5268 s at 16,384 and 0.5039 s at 4,096.  The optimum is
interior, it is 8,192 columns, and it is what ships.  The two sweeps overlap
at 16,384 and agree there to 0.0005 s, which is what lets the nine widths be
read as one curve.

So the width that SHIPS is the measured one and the derivation is a receipt
term.  Both halves are tested here: the arithmetic still has to be right,
because the receipt states it and the next card's sweep will be argued
against it, and the shipped default has to be the number the sweeps
measured, because a default that quietly re-derives itself is how the
regression got in.  Every test injects its card rather than reading one, so
the CPU tier proves the arithmetic on the 5090, on a 10 GiB card and on no
card at all from the same run.

The width is workspace shape only -- one thread owns one whole column, reads
no neighbour, and the kernels hold no shared memory, no atomic and no
per-chunk seed -- so nothing here is a claim about the forecast.  That claim
is ``test_the_column_chunk_is_not_a_seam`` in
``tests/test_mynn_pbl_scratch.py``, which needs a card, the sweeps' own
twenty arms, which wrote one digest between them, and the 1,500-step pair at
8,192 columns whose 244 frames were byte-identical to the baseline's.
