"""GF's RTHBLTEN/RQVBLTEN lanes on the ARW path, with a BOUND driver.

THE BREAKAGE THIS FILE PREVENTS, named twice because it happened twice:

1.  The Grell-Freitas adapter reads its boundary-layer forcing off the
    bound :class:`~woof.core.physics.PhysicsDriver`
    (``gf_rthblten``/``gf_rqvblten``).  Every other GF test in this suite
    drives the adapter with ``driver=None`` -- the parity harnesses launch
    the kernel directly, and ``test_gf_engine_smoke`` asserts the binding
    exists without ever reading a lane's VALUE.  So the whole family stayed
    553-passed green across the merge that switched those two GFDRV inputs
    from hard zeros to real rates, because the tested path reads zeros
    either way.  A real ARW forecast does not: it binds the driver, the PBL
    slot runs before cumulus in the same ``compute()``, and GFDRV integrates
    the boundary layer's actual heating and moistening.  This file exercises
    the bound path and asserts the lanes are non-zero AND that GF's answer
    moves when they are.

2.  Retention was written into ``_run_ysu`` alone, so the fix landed for one
    PBL scheme out of five.  A run pairing GF with MYJ, MYNN, Shin-Hong or
    SASE went on feeding the cumulus scheme zeros -- wrong by exactly the
    argument that made the YSU change right.  The parametrised case below
    covers every scheme the engine ships in the PBL slot, so a sixth scheme
    added later cannot quietly reintroduce the hole.

WRF's cumulus driver hands RTHBLTEN/RQVBLTEN to GFDRV without asking which
scheme filled them (module_cumulus_driver.F), and the arrays persist between
PBL calls, so last-computed retention is WRF's own contract.
