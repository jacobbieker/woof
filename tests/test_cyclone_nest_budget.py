# cells: a diagonal 8 at 40 keeps 0.64 of the child against a 0.7 floor, so
# the derivation could not reproduce the preset and the first rungs above it
# derived less.  The preset's maximum is now the 6 its own floor admits, so
# the table is monotone from 40 up and the step is gone.  It is asserted
# whole so it cannot move unnoticed, and so the prose describing it cannot go
