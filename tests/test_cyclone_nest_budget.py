# rebuild transient before it compares anything, so it refuses against a
# budget SMALLER than the flat road's, and smaller than the fit target too:
# 4.99 through 5.005 GiB refuse while the fit target sits ABOVE the price, and
# 5.01 admits.  The number the sentence quotes has to be the one that bound,
# which is at or under the price.  (Measured on the 50 hPa model top the GFS
# emission carries; the band sat 0.01 GiB higher on the old 100 hPa top, and
# at 5.035 through 5.05 while the RRTMGP solver's frame was priced at a stale
# 5,152 B, which charged this tree 8,355,840 B more.  It sat at 5.025
# through 5.045, admitting at 5.05, on the plan's 1.15 margin; A163 measured
# the forecast margin at 1.13 of the subtotal, read again at 0.005 GiB steps
# from 4.85 to 5.07.)
