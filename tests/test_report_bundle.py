"""What `woof report` must never leak, never crash on, and never fake.

The headline test here is
:func:`test_planted_identity_never_reaches_the_bundle`:
a distinctive fake username, hostname, IPv4, MAC, home directory, e-mail
and API key are planted in EVERY collectable surface -- a path segment, a
config value, a receipt's JSON, a log line, an environment variable, and
a file's own name -- and none of them may appear anywhere in the bundle's
bytes.  Its control,
:func:`test_the_planted_identity_test_can_fail`, disables the redactor
and asserts the same strings DO come through, so the headline assertion
can never quietly become vacuous by collecting nothing.

The rest is the accuracy contract: a run directory with no receipts must
produce a bundle that SAYS it has none rather than a thin one that looks
complete; a full disk must relocate the bundle rather than lose it; and
`woof report` with no arguments inside a run directory must find the run
it is standing in.
