"""One price and one ``[tiles]`` decision for the offline child, on both doors.

The failure these pin: a 138x138x49 child the plan review admitted at
2.90 GiB against 7.32 GiB free was refused at run start with "no tile fits
in 3.49 GiB of VRAM", because the runner asked the tile planner AFTER it
had filled the card and with no estimate, so the planner charged the whole
rung's fixed cost against what the process had left.  The fix is one
function both doors call (:mod:`woof.downscale_pricing`), on a machine
captured before any device allocation.
