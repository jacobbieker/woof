"""The card memory a fit priced travels as a record, on every route New forecast drives.

New forecast showed how close a draft sits to its card ("needs 4.9 of 14.5 GiB") by reading a line the
engine printed.  Only ``woof check`` prints that line, and the wizard runs the check only when the run's
inputs are already on disk.  A GFS draft has none to wait for; an ERA5 draft's forcing is fetched when the
run starts, so its check is deferred, the line never came, and the page showed the card name alone for
every ERA5 draft, at 80 or 100 levels as at 49.

The wizard prices every draft before it writes the configuration, so that is where the figure is taken:
``woof run-plan --resolve`` answers with a ``memory`` record, in bytes, and the page reads the record.

A draft too big for its card was the same defect on the refusal side.  The page read how big it was from
the refusal's words, which say ``at X GiB peak envelope`` for a source whose preprocessing is priced (ERA5,
GFS) and ``needs X GiB peak envelope ... is NOT PRICED`` for one whose preprocessing is not (HRRR, RAP,
ECMWF open data).  Only the first was read, so a too-big HRRR draft said the engine could not fit the box
and to read the server's log.  The refusal now carries the same two figures as a document on the machine
channel, and the page reads the document.

These tests hold the records to the figures the wizard and the check print, on every route, and hold the
page's reader to the records.  No network and no card: a declared card is priced on the CPU.
