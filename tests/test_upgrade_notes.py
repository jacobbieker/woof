"""The release notes and the doctor's upgrade note say the same things.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS: the 2.7.0 candidate carried seventeen
default-on result changes (map-factor mixing, total-water pressure,
km_opt=2 surface drag, KF shallow 2400, NSSL/Morrison/GF/P3/MYNN
transcription corrections, ERA5 lake water, HRRR soil downscaling, ...)
and two classes of file that stop loading (every 2.6.5 checkpoint, a
namelist without input_from_file), and neither the CHANGELOG's release
section nor ``woof doctor``'s upgrade note mentioned one of them.  The
two surfaces were written independently, so each could be complete
while the other said nothing.

:mod:`woof.upgrade_notes` is the one table; this file pins CHANGELOG.md
to it entry by entry and drives the doctor through both of its doors.
