"""``PHYSICS.md``'s reachability prose, derived from the things that own it.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
Twice in one week a reader concluded from this page that MYNN's physics
was hardcoded and could not be run with longwave radiation.  Once it was
an outside collaborator, once one of this project's own agents.  Both
readings were wrong, both were reasonable, and both came from the same
two sentences: a ``reachability`` column that says how a MENU can offer
an option, printed with no hint that the config route composes freely,
and a MYNN row that said the scheme was "admitted only as the coupled
5/5 pair".

Fixing the prose is not enough, because the prose was not wrong when it
was written -- it DRIFTED.  Measured while writing this file:

* the revised MM5 row said ``unreachable`` and "no route allows the
  override" while the registry had it at ``component-override`` and the
  prepared-domain-tree route listed it in
  ``allowed_component_options.surface_layer``;
* the MYNN rows said the PBL was admitted only as the 5/5 pair, while
  the loader accepts ``bl_pbl_physics=5`` beside surface layers 91 and 1
  as well -- 48, 48 and 72 distinct accepted combinations in the
  composition walk.  The real restriction runs the other way and belongs
  to the MYNN SURFACE LAYER, which WRF v4.6.1 admits only with MYNN or
  no PBL.

So this file derives every reachability claim on the page from the
object that owns it, and asserts the page matches:

======================================  ==============================
claim on the page                       authority
======================================  ==============================
each surface-layer row's reachability   ``physics_registry_v2.json``
                                        ``components.*.reachability``
the definition block quoted for         the registry's own
``reachability.state``                  ``authority.reachability_
                                        declaration``
which options are registry-             the registry, cross-checked
``unreachable``, and what a config      against the accepted counts in
naming each one actually gets           the composition-walk receipt
the twelve pinned MYNN knobs            ``woof.config.MYNN_PBL_
                                        OPTION_IDENTITY``
the refusal text quoted for a moved     ``build_experiment`` itself,
knob, and for YSU + MYNN surface        called on a real config
the ``implemented-unverified`` census   the registry
======================================  ==============================

Two of these are executed rather than read, because a quoted error
message is the one kind of documentation a user compares against their
own terminal character by character.
