"""The Rust WIF ingest path against the NumPy oracle-of-record.

WHAT THIS GATE PREVENTS (gate law): the data path silently drifting off
the numbers commit 94260bf44 bound against WRF-4.7.1 real.exe on a development machine.
The NumPy expressions in ``woof/ingest/wif_climatology.py`` are the ones
that were measured there; the Rust engine is what a run actually uses.
Nothing else compares the two, so without this test a change to the
bridge -- or a rebuild against a different library -- could move QNWFA on
every mp=28 climatology run with no test saying so.

The tolerances below are NOT taste.  Decode, horizontal and the surface
emission are held BIT-EXACT, because nothing in either implementation
rounds differently there and a single differing bit means a real
divergence.  Only the vertical stage is allowed a residual, and its bound
is the oracle's own margin against real.exe: the Rust route evaluates
WRF's linear window as ``lagrange_setup`` writes it, the reference
evaluates the algebraically identical ``y0 + w*(y1-y0)``, and the two
disagree at the last bits of an FP32 log-p interpolation.
