"""AIGFS through the gauntlet: an atmosphere-only model is TABLE DATA.

NCEP's GraphCast-based 0.25-degree AI forecast is the barest product in
the catalog: six 3-D fields on 13 pressure levels plus 2 m temperature,
10 m wind and MSLP, and NO land surface of any kind.  This file pins the
shape its arrival must take: three packaged JSON documents (the
composition role being an explicit PENDING declaration), one
``_PACKAGED_PROFILES`` row, one upgraded ``_adapter`` row -- and no AIGFS
decode code anywhere.

Two facts dominate the profile and are held here by name:

* THE FRONT DOORS DISAGREE.  The operational product is NOMADS-only and
  stamps subCentre 0; the ``noaa-nws-graphcastgfs-pds`` S3 bucket serves
  a DIFFERENT experimental run under IDENTICAL filenames stamped
  subCentre 2 (500 hPa heights differ by up to 8.66 gpm, MEASURED
  2026-08-17 00Z).  Every selector pins ``subcenter: 0`` so the imposter
  refuses by named identity octet.
* A SOLO INIT IS IMPOSSIBLE.  No soil, mask, orography, skin or surface
  pressure exists in any file, so the target declares the seven missing
  canonicals pending the cross-source composition and the source stays
  non-runnable with a named reason.

Selectors were authored from real 2026-08-17 00Z bytes (NOMADS
aigfs.t00z.pres/sfc, both front doors inventoried) through the converged
grib-core inventory.
