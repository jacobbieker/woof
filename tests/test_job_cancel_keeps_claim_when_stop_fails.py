"""A job cancel that did not stop the job keeps its card claim and writes no cancelled result.

The defect: ``JobManager.cancel`` ended the job with a bare ``taskkill`` on
the recorded PID (Windows) and ignored its answer, then wrote a cancelled
result and freed the card claim.  The GUI's Stop on Windows goes through it,
so a kill the system refused left the forecast running on the card while
the page said it had stopped and the next GPU job could claim the card
beside it.  Cancel now signals the recorded wrapper through
``proc_identity.signal_process`` and only a signal that went through
publishes the result and frees the card.
