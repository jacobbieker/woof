"""Is woof's physics arbitrary?  Measured, not argued.

The claim under test is that a user composes microphysics, PBL, surface
layer, land surface, radiation, cumulus and turbulence freely -- that there
is no engine lock quietly pinning a run to one of the shipped named suites.
It has been asserted in review threads more than once and believed by
nobody, including the people who wrote it, because the evidence for it was
always "read this file".

So it is measured.  ``tools/report_physics_composition_walk.py`` writes
the declared physics combinations into real experiment TOMLs and pushes every one
through :func:`woof.experiment.build_experiment` -- the single front door
``woof run``, ``woof go``, ``woof check``, both prepared runners and the
DA drivers reach a per-domain ``RunConfig`` through -- and records what
that call did.  This file pins the properties of the result:

* every admitted value of every axis appears in an ACCEPTED run, so no axis
  is decorative;
* the shipped presets are a tiny corner of what is admitted, so the presets
  are not the space;
* every ACCEPTED run kept every switch the file set, so an admission is
  never a silent rewrite;
* every refusal names why, and DOING WHAT THE REFUSAL SAYS produces an
  accepted run -- the property that caught the one defect this walk found
  (the ``km_opt=2`` message used to recommend ``km_opt=3``, which is
  refused for the same reason three lines above it);
* the axis tables are what the loader actually admits, measured by
  scanning integers at it rather than transcribed from reading
  ``woof/config.py``;
* and MYNN -- the suite family that started this -- composes with every
  land surface and every radiation pairing the loader admits at all.

Two controls keep the whole thing from being vacuous: the walk's window is
checked to contain no local night (or the 1.7.1 nocturnal guard would be
answering a different question), and a mutation control shows the harness
can still produce a refusal when one is warranted.
