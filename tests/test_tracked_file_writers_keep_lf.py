"""Every writer in this repository that lands on a TRACKED file writes LF.

WHAT THIS IS NOT: a rule about `Path.write_text`.  There are 1,476 bare
`write_text` calls across 447 tracked non-vendored modules and almost all
of them write a scratch directory, a temp file, or an argparse
destination, where the platform's line ending is the right one.  A
blanket sweep would be 1,455 edits preventing nothing.

WHAT IT IS: the twenty-one call sites, in ten files, whose receiver
actually resolves to a path this repository TRACKS.  There the pathlib
default is a defect, because `write_text` opens in text mode and
translates every "\\n" to `os.linesep` on the way out -- so on Windows a
script that rewrites a tracked file flips its whole line endings, and
`tests/test_line_ending_stability.py` records what that costs: whole-file
merge conflicts with the real semantic conflict invisible underneath, and
split SHA-256 digests where the product hashes its own sources.

THE LIVE INSTANCE, measured on the artifact.  The four Noah-MP mutation
studies do

    original = SOURCE.read_text()
    ...
    finally:
        SOURCE.write_text(original)

against `woof/core/noahmp_{driver,sflx,soilwater,water}.py` -- 2,678
lines of tracked core physics, all LF today and none of them recorded
debt in `_CRLF_DEBT`.  Copying `woof/core/noahmp_water.py` and running
one `read_text()` / `write_text()` round trip through it took the file
from 0 CR bytes to 352, one per line.  The `finally` block whose entire
job is to RESTORE the file is what does it, so any Windows run of any of
those studies would land four whole-file diffs on core physics.

The remaining six write JSON reports and fixtures that are likewise
tracked.  `tools/build_registry.py` made this same fix at cdd08f005 and
`tools/noahmp_wrf461_oracle/mutation_study_snow.py` carries the
`newline=""` spelling; this file pins the rest of them red-on-revert.
