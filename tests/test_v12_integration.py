"""v1.2 assembly seams: the places where two lanes have to agree.

EXPERIMENTAL, like everything the six v1.2 lanes shipped.  Each lane's own
suite proves that lane correct in isolation; nothing in those suites can
prove that the ensemble engine's manifest is the manifest the product side
reads, or that the radar lane's file is the file the filter ingests.  These
tests exercise one lane's real writer against another lane's real reader
with no fixture in between, because a fixture is exactly where two lanes
can agree with a third thing and still disagree with each other.

CPU-only by construction: no CuPy import anywhere in this file.
