"""``woof doctor``'s verdict on the eigensolver the radar-DA analysis needs.

This line exists because of a specific field failure, twice: the analysis died
inside cuSOLVER while every other piece of evidence said the GPU was healthy.
It was healthy -- cupy's core, its elementwise kernels and its reductions all
load independently of cuBLAS/cuSOLVER, so an install can multiply arrays all
day and still be unable to factor one.  A check that only proves "cupy
imports" reproduces the masquerade instead of catching it.

Every branch is forced here rather than left to whatever this box happens to
have, because on a working box only one of the four is reachable and the other
three are exactly the ones a reader in trouble will see.
