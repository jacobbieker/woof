"""GPUWM_NO_LOCAL_GPU means NO device read, everywhere, from one definition.

The 2.5.0 upgrader walk set ``GPUWM_NO_LOCAL_GPU=1`` for every step and
still watched the ``woof go`` memory gate report "the card has 8.88 GiB
free right now": the gate's probe subprocess read the local device
because nothing on that path consulted the variable.  Whatever a user
believes the switch governs, a gate that measures the card anyway makes
the belief false in the one place it costs VRAM on a card the user said
not to touch.

The contract this file pins:

* :mod:`woof.local_gpu` is THE definition -- one truthiness rule, one
  docstring stating the scope (no device open, no context, no
  memGetInfo; it does not claim cupy is uninstalled);
* the device memory probe honors it BEFORE spawning anything, and the
  reason it returns names the variable;
* the go memory gate under the variable prices the phases, refuses
  nothing on a card it was told not to read, and its verdict says why
  there are no measured numbers;
* no product module reads the raw environment variable beside the one
  definition, so the scope cannot fork again.
