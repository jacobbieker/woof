"""The per-land-column cost of a Noah-MP call, measured at several widths.

Two things are measured here and they answer different questions.

``test_the_column_cost_is_flat_or_it_is_not`` is the **width sweep**.  A
per-column cost that does not fall as columns are added is the signature of
per-column host work: it is not a launch cost, not a transfer cost and not an
under-occupied kernel.  That is how the original 7.24 ms/column diagnosis was
made, and it is the only measurement that can say whether a conversion moved
work to the device *at width* rather than merely on one column.  It runs both
modes on the same process and the same inputs -- the paired host authority
(:func:`woof.core.noahmp_runtime.evaluate_leaf_batch_on_host`, the CPython
leaves the WRF fixtures pin) and the device batches -- so the ratio is not
contaminated by machine differences.

It is **opt-in**: ``WOOF_NOAHMP_WIDTH_SWEEP=1``.  At 352 land columns the host
authority alone is several seconds per step, so this is not something the
ordinary suite should pay for.  ``WOOF_NOAHMP_WIDTH_MAX`` caps the largest
grid and ``WOOF_NOAHMP_WIDTH_REPS`` the repetition count.

Absolute milliseconds are a property of the *machine*, not of this port; the
project has already recorded different figures for the local RTX 5090 and a
rented Linux one.  Print the host and device figures together, name the box,
and do not merge two boxes into one number.
