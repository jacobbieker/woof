"""``woof go``: the documented GFS chain, run without a human courier.

Five commands in a fixed order, three of them taking digests the
previous one printed.  ``go`` carries those values between stages by
reading the ARTIFACTS -- the manifest file, ``proof.json`` -- rather
than the printed prose, and runs the same commands a person would so
the provenance in the artifacts is the same either way.

The essential tests here are the two equivalence gates.  ``go``'s
composed ``rw-wps`` line must equal the one ``woof fetch
--author-front-door-manifest`` prints, and its composed forecast line
must equal the one the front door prints, because those printed
commands ARE the documented manual chain.  If either drifts, ``go``
stops being an automation of the documented route and becomes a second
route that happens to look like it.

    two tests below are what hold it.  Until 2026-08-06 the wizard's own
    ``--physics-profile``-less emission produced such a config, so they

    ``DEFAULT_SUITE_PHYSICS`` suite, which
    :data:`woof.domain_wizard.DEFAULT_PHYSICS_PROFILE`'s own docstring
