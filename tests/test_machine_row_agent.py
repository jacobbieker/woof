"""A machine row changed to another host sends the agent again, and a failed helper call keeps its words.

The defects: a changed row kept the note that the agent had been sent, so
the next call went to an agent that was not on the new host (a new
address, or a cloud machine's new instance under the same workspace path);
and a helper that failed on the machine showed the page plain words while
its own words (a traceback) went nowhere, so whoever looked after the
machine had nothing to read.
