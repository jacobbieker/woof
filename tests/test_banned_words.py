"""Two words the project does not use stay out of its first-party text.

The 2.7.5 sweep took them out of the prose, the comments, the docstrings
and the identifiers of every first-party tree, one reading each.  What
it could not take them out of is named in ``tests/banned_word_allowlist.tsv``
with the reason, and every reason is a pin: a file whose BYTES are an
anchor (a frozen kernel digest, a fixture receipt, a prepared-tree
run-control document), a dated record, or an emitted receipt key that
readers of earlier receipts depend on.

The sweep missed occurrences twice before it had a gate -- the second
pass found twelve in eight files that the first had not opened -- so
the gate is the sweep's own walk:

* an occurrence anywhere outside the allowlist fails, naming the line;
* an allowlisted path must exist and must carry EXACTLY the count the
  allowlist records, so a carve-out cannot outlive its subject and a new
  occurrence inside a carved-out file cannot hide behind the old ones.

This file spells neither word, so it passes its own scan.
