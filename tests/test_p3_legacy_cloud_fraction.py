"""P3 (mp=50) reaches WRF's own cloud-fraction arm on the legacy RRTMG path.

WHAT THIS PREVENTS.  ``woof/core/rrtmg_legacy.py`` used to read ONE
boolean, ``legacy_ice_active(mp_physics)``, into BOTH of ``cal_cldfra1``'s
``f_qi`` and ``f_qs``.  A fused flag has only two states, so a package
carrying ice and no snow -- which is exactly P3's
(``Registry/Registry.EM_COMMON:3038``: ``moist:qv,qc,qr,qi``) -- could not
be spelled at all, and mp=50 fell out of the set to ``False``.  That sent
an ice-bearing P3 column to ``cal_cldfra1``'s qc-only arm, whose QCLD is
cloud WATER alone: a pure ice cloud came back with cloud fraction 0.0 and
radiated as clear sky.

WRF does not fuse them.  ``phys/module_radiation_driver.F`` branches on the
two flag VALUES separately and gives this case its own arm at :3879-3887,
commented "for P3, mp option 50 or 51", with ``QCLD = QI + QC`` and
``weight = QI/QCLD``.

The remedy is the split, NOT admitting 50 to
``_LEGACY_ICE_ACTIVE_MICROPHYSICS``: that set answers ``F_QI and F_QS``,
and putting P3 in it would assert a snow species P3 does not have.
