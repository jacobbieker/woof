"""``CumulusResult``'s momentum pair: inert when absent, applied when present.

WHY THE FIRST HALF IS THE ESSENTIAL ONE. The extension exists for New
Tiedtke, which is the first cumulus scheme in this tree with ``lmfdudv``
(``cu_ntiedtke.F90:55``, a PARAMETER, so its momentum update is not a
runtime option). Every scheme the owner runs today -- Grell-Freitas and
Kain-Fritsch -- supplies neither field, and the whole point of capturing
four baselines before this landed is that their answers must not move by
one bit.

Inertness here is **by construction, not by care**: with ``ru`` absent,
``couple_column_tendencies`` returns the same zero stacks it always did.
This file asserts that, and the forecast-level gate
(``docs/ntiedtke/PHASE2-BASELINES.md``) proves it on real runs.

AND THE SECOND HALF IS THE NEGATIVE CONTROL. An extension that is inert
because it never does anything would pass the first test perfectly. So the
supplied path is checked to actually move the momentum stacks, and to go
through the SAME face interpolation YSU's momentum takes rather than a
second copy of it.
