"""No shipped file may carry one machine's absolute paths.

RELEASE-EXCLUDE has always *said* "no developer-specific absolute
paths".  Nothing enforced it, and the v1.0.1 exit audit found 51 such
lines across 25 tracked files that every exclusion rule had let
through -- a WSL home in an executable default, a Windows profile in a
committed process capture, a developer's tree in an oracle receipt.

An exclusion manifest cannot close that class: it cannot name the file
that grows a machine path next week.  So the snapshot builder scans
every staged text file and refuses to build.  This module holds the
tests for that scan, plus the regression that matters most -- the
current tree, minus its exclusions, is clean.

Every offending string below is assembled from fragments rather than
written out, because this file is one of the files the scan reads.  A
literal here would flag the test that tests the scan, which is both
confusing and, at the moment it happened, indistinguishable from a real
finding.  ``tools/build_native_wrf_distribution.py`` does the same for
the same reason.
