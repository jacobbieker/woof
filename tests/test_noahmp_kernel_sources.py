"""Every Noah-MP kernel compiles, and the per-thread local frames are priced.

Two facts about the Noah-MP kernel directory are not visible from the directory
listing and have already cost another lane a measurement:

* ``noahmp_driver.cu``, ``noahmp_energy.cu`` and ``noahmp_thermal.cu`` are
  fragments.  Each borrows the single device transcription of glibc's powf /
  expf / logf that lives in ``noahmp_leaves.cu``, so each is compiled after it.
  A sweep that compiles every ``.cu`` alone reports them broken, and anything
  it then computes about ``sf_surface_physics = 4`` is computed from kernels
  that never compiled.
* ``noahmp_fluxprep.cu`` is the opposite: it carries its own libm tables, so
  prepending ``noahmp_leaves.cu`` to *it* is a duplicate definition.

So neither "compile each file alone" nor "compile everything after the libm" is
right, and :data:`woof.core.noahmp_kernel_sources.NOAHMP_TRANSLATION_UNITS` is
the table that says which is which.  This file pins it both ways: every listed
unit compiles, and every composed unit still genuinely fails alone -- without
the second half the table could quietly become decorative.

NVRTC is a host compiler.  Everything here runs without a CUDA device.

# identity rather than a compile-time ceiling, so the frames should be small.
# "Should be" is not a measurement, and this is the measurement.

#: The largest per-thread frame any Noah-MP kernel may declare, in bytes.
#: 4 KiB is roughly 1,000 floats -- far above anything a seven-layer column
#: needs and far below the 24 KiB that cost 5.7 GiB elsewhere in this project.
#: If a conversion ever needs more than this, the reservation it implies has to
