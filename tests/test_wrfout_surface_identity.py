# tests/test_wrfout_surface_identity.py
"""woof's own wrfout carries the land/soil identity its own child needs.

THE DEFECT THIS PINS.  ``woof downscale`` takes a child-grid history file
as ``--child-surface-from`` and refuses to fabricate land identity; the
nine fields it requires are ``woof.offline_child._SURFACE_REQUIRED_FIELDS``.
woof's history writer published six of the nine.  ISLTYP, TMN and VEGFRA
were carried in ``PhysicsDriver.fields`` from initialization, written into
every restart, read by the land-surface scheme every step -- and never
emitted.  So a woof wrfout was refused as a surface source for a woof
child, on a real 12 km parent and again on a nested d02 (measured at the
2.2.1 cut).

The tests here are written against the two SEAMS rather than against a
run: ``_live_state_history_fields``, the pure mapping both frame builders
consume, and the file a ``WrfoutWriter`` actually emits -- read back with
netCDF4 and handed to the child's own reader.  That last one is the point:
the acceptance is proven by the CONSUMER, not by a list in this file
agreeing with a list in that one.
