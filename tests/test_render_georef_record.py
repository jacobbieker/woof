"""``render-georef.json`` lists every delivered picture, through ``woof.render``.

The breakage this pins: ``rw_wrfbatch`` keys its record by the flat name
it drew each picture under and drops an entry whose file has left the
folder, and ``woof.render`` moves and renames every launch's pictures
into ``<domain>/<product>/<valid-day>/`` right after that launch.  So on
the next launch every earlier batch fell out of the record: three d02
frames rendered through ``render_wrfouts_rust`` delivered 6 pictures and
listed 2.  The engine's own tests could not see it, because they launch
the binary into a folder where nothing ever moves.

The engine is stubbed at ``subprocess.run`` the way the other rust-engine
unit tests stub it, and the stub keeps the engine's record contract: it
writes each picture flat, then merges its batch into the folder's record
under the record's lock, keeping only entries whose file is still there.
Everything after the engine exits is the real render path.
