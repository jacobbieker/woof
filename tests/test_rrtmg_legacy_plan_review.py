"""Plan review is what asks the legacy-RRTMG readiness gate (CPU only).

NO DEVICE IS IMPORTED HERE, and that is the reason this module exists
apart from ``tests/test_rrtmg_legacy_selection.py``.  That module imports
cupy in a helper, so ``tests/conftest.py`` marks every test in it ``gpu``
and skips them all under ``GPUWM_NO_LOCAL_GPU=1`` -- which is the
invocation this lane and the merge suites run.  A caller pin that skips
is not a pin: with the call deleted from ``validate_run_config`` the
whole module still reported green.  Nothing below touches a card.
