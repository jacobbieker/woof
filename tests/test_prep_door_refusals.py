"""The mapped prep door answers users in refusals, never tracebacks.

The 2.5.0 persona walks (UX finding N6) drove ``woof prep --source
hrrr-prs`` with a config written by the REAL ``woof import-namelist``
from an ordinary WRF 4.6 namelist pair -- ``e_vert = 45`` and no
explicit ``eta_levels``, which is what every stock WRF case looks like
because real.exe generates the ladder itself.  The door answered with
three raw Python tracebacks, and the second and third formed a circle:

1. a missing ``--experiment-config`` file raised a bare
   ``FileNotFoundError`` with no flag name and no remedy;
2. the imported 44 mass levels met the mapping's fixed reference count
   of 49 as ``ValueError: mapped target vertical levels differ``;
3. matching the count (nz = 49) then raised ``explicit eta_levels has
   shape (0,)`` -- demanding a ladder ``import-namelist`` never writes
   and no WRF user types, so no edit the previous message suggested
   could ever terminate.

Every test here subprocesses the real CLI door, exactly as the walk
did.  The contract: a user-reachable refusal exits with the shared
preparation-refusal status, prints the sentence and ITS remedy on
stderr, and never a traceback; and the circle is broken because a
config that CARRIES an explicit ladder is adopted at its own level
count, while a config without one gets both counts and both
reconciling doors named in one message.
