"""`woof go`'s own GFS chain asks run-plan's disk admission before it claims a folder or fetches.

The chain `woof go` runs by itself for GFS enters no run plan, so the
admission `woof run-plan` gives every run (download, preparation,
history, checkpoints and pictures against the free space of the disks
that hold them) was never asked on it: a drive with no room still had
its run folder claimed and its download started.
