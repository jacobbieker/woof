"""The hierarchy forwards --ack into its namelist import.

The concrete breakage this gate prevents: every shortwave-only shipped
profile (the ones the wizard offers small cards) requires the
``constant-downward-longwave-v1`` declared-experiment acknowledgement,
and a WRF namelist has no spelling for it -- so before the seam existed
``woof.hrrr_hierarchy_direct`` refused ITS OWN wizard-emitted namelist
pair at import time and no nested tree could ever be prepared on those
profiles.  The importer grew the ``acknowledgements`` kwarg for exactly
this; the hierarchy just never passed it.
