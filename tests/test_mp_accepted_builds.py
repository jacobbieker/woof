"""ACCEPTED IMPLIES BUILDS: the rung between "prices" and "steps".

The 1.9 gate's class-killer (tests/test_composition_pricing.py) proves
every composition the loader accepts can be PRICED by the memory
preflight, and the proof-of-life sims prove a built state can STEP.
Between them sat an unguarded rung: a scheme the loader accepts whose
declared shape manifest does not cover the state builder's full symbol
closure cannot BUILD its real-case workspace -- the shared dycore-state
workspace is sized from ``preflight.state_array_shapes`` intersected with
the restart manifest's REBUILT set, and the state builder's
``rebuilt(<symbol>)`` view of an unpriced symbol raises at allocation.

Two schemes shipped through that gap in one release: mp_physics=50 into
the 1.9 assembly (pricing, closed by test_composition_pricing) and
mp_physics=9 in shipped 1.9.0 (this rung -- preflight declared no mp=9
moist shapes at all, so an ACCEPTED Milbrandt-Yau real case died building
its workspace; 1.9.1 D1).  This suite closes the rung for EVERY
``mp_physics`` value the config loader accepts, so the next port cannot
recreate the class: for each accepted value it builds the shared
workspace exactly the way the multi-domain forecast does, constructs the
DomainState against it, and requires the full allocated symbol closure to
be (a) declared in the shape manifest and (b) classified in the restart
manifest.

CPU-only: the state module's array namespace is monkeypatched to NumPy,
the same seam tests/test_preflight.py's workspace tests use.
