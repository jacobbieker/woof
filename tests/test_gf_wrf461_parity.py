"""Grell-Freitas float32 reference against the byte-frozen WRF v4.6.1 oracle.

Stage 1 of the port: GFDRV's column preparation
(module_cu_gf_wrfdrv.F:383-492).  The oracle for it is
``gf-stage-levels.csv`` / ``gf-stage-surface.csv``, which record the prepared
column exactly as the driver built it, beside the raw 3-D inputs in
``gf-levels.csv`` / ``gf-surface.csv`` that it built them from.

Every assertion here is ``max_ulp == 0``.  The preparation is straight
arithmetic on measured constants -- no libm, no branches that a rounding can
flip -- so there is no accurate reason for it to be anything else, and a
tolerance here would hide exactly the mixed-precision mistake this stage
exists to prevent.
