"""Shared fixtures, and the guarantee that ``-m "not gpu"`` touches no device.

The GPU exclusion used to rest on every author remembering
``@pytest.mark.gpu``.  That failed silently and expensively: five Noah-MP CUDA
modules gated only on ``pytest.importorskip("cupy")`` and carried no marker, so
``-m "not gpu"`` *collected* them -- an unmarked test is not excluded by
``not gpu`` -- and 34 CUDA gates compiled and ran on a machine whose owner had
asked that no GPU work run there at all.  A convention that fails open is not a
convention; it is a hope.

Three things close it, in increasing order of strength:

* every test whose module imports cupy is marked ``gpu`` **automatically**, so
  the exclusion no longer depends on anyone remembering;
* ``GPUWM_NO_LOCAL_GPU=1`` skips those tests outright and stops this file
  importing cupy at all, so no device is opened even to ask whether one exists;
* ``tests/test_gpu_marker_discipline.py`` fails if any cupy-importing module
  would survive ``-m "not gpu"``.

Detection is by AST over the module's own source, not by inspecting
``sys.modules``: a module that imports cupy inside a function still needs the
marker, and reading the source cannot itself trigger an import.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# the second property: cupy INSTALLED, which is not the same as a device
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The marker above is about OPENING A DEVICE, and this file's own reasoning
# says why merely importing cupy is not the crime.  There is a separate
# question it does not answer, and until 2026-09-17 nothing did: can this
# selection even be COLLECTED on an install that has no cupy at all?
#
# MEASURED on a development machine in a venv built from the runtime dependencies with no
# cupy extra: ``-m "not gpu and not slow and not network"`` over the stage-1
# and always lists ends in ``Interrupted: 8 errors during collection`` and
# runs NOTHING.  Six of those eight are cupy: a test module imports a
# first-party module which imports cupy UNGUARDED at its own module scope,
# so the import fails at collection and takes the session with it.  Seven
# further tests are collected and fail with ModuleNotFoundError, five of
# them through a route no source scan can see (the command line, then
# ``woof.core.clock.resolve_clock``, then ``woof/core/physics.py:37``).
#
# THIS IS NOT FIXED BY MARKING THEM ``gpu``, and that was the first thing
# tried.  It would mark 156 tests across 59 files, none of which opens a
# device, and remove every one of them from the CPU legs on a properly
# provisioned box -- which is coverage loss wearing a safety costume, in
# this file's own words, and the tree's position is the opposite one:
# ``tools/battery/provision_battery_venv.ps1`` installs the ``all`` extra
# for the CPU legs and says in writing that "six stage-1 files import cupy
# at collection".  Six is exactly what was measured.  cupy is PROVISIONED
# for those legs by design.
#
# So the remedy matches the property.  When cupy is ABSENT, a module that
# cannot be imported without it is not collected, and a test whose body
# reaches such a module is skipped -- by name, counted, and printed in the
# terminal summary, never silently.  When cupy is PRESENT, which is every
# battery leg, nothing below changes anything at all: no item is skipped,
# no module is dropped, and every count stays what the census recorded.
# What changes is that an install without cupy now produces a CPU run with
# a named set of skips instead of a collection that dies.

#: Whether ``import cupy`` would succeed here.  Asked of the FINDER, so
#: nothing is imported and no device is contacted even to answer: the

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# STAGED RUST ARTIFACTS: one probe per capability, and a skip that says how
# to stage it.
#
# 110 cases in thirteen files read a staged Rust artifact and had no gate at
# all, so on a box where the artifact is absent -- or, worse, STALE -- they
# reported a red suite that says nothing about the tree.  Measured on the
# Linux CPU box (2026-09-11): 54 cases died on `rw_netcdf: Times is a String
# variable` from a bridge staged months ago, 25 on a CPU preprocessing
# library too old to export the symbol the call needs, 11 on a grib1 bridge
# that was never built, and 20 on the absent wrf-rust distribution.  A red
# for a missing tool is indistinguishable from a red for a defect, which is
# the whole reason to gate.
#
# The probes ask about the CAPABILITY, never merely about the file.  An
# artifact that is present and too old is the case that actually happened,
# and "the binary exists" answers it wrong.  Each reason names the command
# that stages the artifact, because a skip a reader cannot act on is a
# silence.
