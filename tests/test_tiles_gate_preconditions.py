"""No [tiles] gate may report success over an empty comparison.

The release line spent a night on this class in its own gates
(``d998bb667`` / ``9b1b99289``): ``woof certify`` exited 0 on a metrics CSV
with a header and no data rows, and ``woof dual-run`` reported "capsules are
identical field for field" over two empty documents.  Every row condition is
a statement about all rows and is true of none.

The gates that arrived with the streamed-run port had the same three shapes:

  * ``tilestream.test_gate.compare`` hashed two empty carrier maps to the
    SHA-256 of nothing, found the two digests equal, and recorded
    ``bitexact`` having compared no carrier;
  * ``tilestream.decomp.assert_slice_faithful`` returned ``ok=not bad``, so
    ``checked == 0`` was a pass;
  * the three ``GATE PASSED`` lines asserted totality and stated no size, so
    the count everybody quotes lived in the operator's scrollback rather
    than in the verdict.

This suite pins the fixes.  It is numpy-only and touches no card, which is
why it is on the stage-1 list rather than the GPU shard: the defect is in
the verdict arithmetic, and the verdict arithmetic runs anywhere.

The floors here are ONE, deliberately, and not the full expected count: a
``--quick`` run or a ``--*-only`` selector is a legitimate partial result and
must stay a result rather than become a refusal.
