"""The streamed-run lane's gate list, kept accurate in the repository.

``tools/battery/tiles_gates.txt`` is how the battery finds the ``[tiles]``
gates.  They are not pytest -- each is a module whose ``main()`` prints a
matrix and one verdict line -- so nothing collects them by accident and
nothing notices when one stops existing.  That is the same hole
``tools/battery/stage1_files.txt`` was written to close for the stage-1
list (task #122), and this suite is the same kind of gate on the same
kind of file: every module resolves, nothing is listed twice, every shard
is one the battery knows how to run, and every entry says what it proves.

It is deliberately cheap and hermetic -- it reads two text files and
touches no card -- because a manifest gate that needs a GPU is a manifest
gate that runs at a release cut instead of on every commit.
