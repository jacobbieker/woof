"""A prepare loop holds ONE forcing time, and its order changes no number.

THE DEFECT.  Every prepared-cache adapter walked its forcing times in
time order and kept the start time until the end: the prepared cache,
the wrfinput export and the surface analysis were all written from it
once the boundaries were complete, so it sat on the device for the whole
loop while each later time was interpolated and initialized underneath
it.  Two complete full-domain analyses and two complete states therefore
coexisted at the peak with only one of them being worked on.  Priced by
``estimate_ingest`` at 800x800x49, mp=10, three GFS times, that second
resident time is 14.67 GiB of device residency against 7.66, and a peak
envelope of 23.92 GiB against 15.86: the difference between preparing
that domain on a 16 GiB card and dying in preprocessing after the whole
forcing chain had already been fetched.

THE FIX holds one time either way.  A single-domain preparation builds
the start time FIRST, writes it into the prepared head, releases it and
only then builds each later time, writing each boundary interval as soon
as its two times exist (chained preparation,
``woof/ingest/boundary_stream.py``).  A preparation that needs every
interval before it can write anything -- a domain tree, or ERA5 with a
water-temperature overlay -- builds the start time LAST instead
(``start_last_forcing_order``); each earlier time hands
:class:`StateBoundaryFrames` its four perimeter strips (host memory,
O(perimeter)) against its own POSITION and is released before the next
is built.  Which makes the acceptance test a bit-identity test, not a
memory test: a reordering that moves one boundary number is not a
reordering, and a prepared cache is not allowed to notice that its
inputs were built in a different sequence.

Every test here is CPU-only and needs no device.
