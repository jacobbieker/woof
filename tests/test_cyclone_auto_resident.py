"""``--tiles auto`` on a TREE means resident when the whole tree fits.

The single-domain road has asked the resident question first since the
configured admission context existed; the tree road did not.  It charged
the tile planner's shared process/radiation floor -- a STREAMED process's
per-rung tables plus a radiation reservation the configured envelope
already carries inside itself -- before one domain was priced, so on a
card with a desktop on it no candidate could pass while the same card
held the tree resident with room to spare.

MEASURED, and these are the numbers below: the 12/3 km moving-nest
cyclone tree (200x160 at 12 km, 160x160 at 3 km, 49 levels, the shipped
GFS suite) against a 6,855,065,600 byte admission budget -- an RTX 3080
with a desktop on it.  The floor is 6,978,986,310 bytes and refused;
the configured tree wants about 5.1e9 bytes and runs.

Three further things this file pins, each of which was a way for the
admitted road and the road actually taken to come apart:

* the refusal a domain's own ``mode = "on"`` provokes on a tree that
  FITS names that table and not the card;
* the plan review and the run door price the admission from ONE shared
  estimate, so a tree the review admits is not refused at run start;
* an automatic tree that MOVES a nest withholds that nest's rebuild from
  the admission budget and records the pinned host copy the move stages
  through, neither of which the steady-state envelope models.
