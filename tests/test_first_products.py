"""Render-on-first-committed-frame: the TTFP finisher, and its guards.

Three groups.  The first drives :class:`woof.first_products.FirstProducts`
and the observer that arms it with a stand-in renderer, so the dispatch
rules, the event and every way this declines to publish are pinned
without spending a real render on them.  The second is the receipt: what
licenses the finalize stage to skip a frame, and every mutation that
must void that licence.  The third runs the REAL renderer on a real
wrfout and checks the two things that cannot be checked any other way --
that a frame rendered early is byte-identical to the same frame rendered
at finalize, and that the render process never creates a CUDA context
while the forecast owns the card.
