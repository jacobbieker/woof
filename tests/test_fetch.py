"""``woof fetch`` gates: URL/cycle/area resolution, manifests, ERA5.

Everything here is CPU + mocked transport.  The two transport seams the
fetch front door reuses (``tools.download_gfs_native_subset._download``
and ``tools.download_hrrr_native_subset._download_product``) are
monkeypatched to publish synthetic-but-envelope-valid GRIB payloads, so
these tests pin URL construction, cycle resolution, record-count
verification, resumability, and manifest correctness without a network.
One optional live smoke (``WOOF_NETWORK_TESTS=1``) touches a single
