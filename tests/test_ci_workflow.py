"""The lanes in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` still run what they claim to.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS
--------------------------
Two of them, and the second is the one that lasts.

1. At a70ade37 `.github/workflows/` held exactly one file, `publish.yml`,
   whose `test` job runs a hand-typed list of 17 packaging/CLI/asset-fetch
   test files -- 452 of the tree's 14,711 test functions by AST count, 3.1%,
   and not one of them exercises dynamics, physics, advection, the acoustic
   solver, the LSM, data assimilation, nesting or restart round-trips.  The
   `-m "not gpu and not slow and not network"` filter that job passes would
   have admitted ~12,500 CPU-runnable test functions; the filename list was
   the only thing that cut it to 452 (audit xc-06-01).

2. Nothing gated that list.  `tools/ci_test_replay.py:123` already parses it,
   and the only consumer of the parse checks that the replay venv seeds
   setuptools -- no test anywhere asserts anything about the list's content,
   size, or non-shrinkage.  Which is F20 of the project's own fault-injection
   audit ("delete ONE line and the suite stops running and nothing says so"),
   closed for the battery lists by `list_census.json` and left open for the
   one list a public contributor's PR is judged by (audit xc-06-08).

So the lane being wide is worth nothing on its own; what is worth something
is that narrowing it has to be a deliberate, reviewable edit to a gated
property.  These tests are those properties: the CPU lane names DIRECTORIES,
the oracle lane reads its decks from the manifest rather than from a copy,
and the GPU lane throws the switch the bundle gates have always documented
and nothing ever threw.
