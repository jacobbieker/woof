"""A stored fetch argv whose area leads with a minus reaches the fetch.

Named breakage: ``woof go`` handed its configuration's ``[fetch]`` table
to the fetch parser as ``--area -20.53,176.87,-14.46,-176.97``.  argparse
reads a leading-minus token as an option unless it is a bare number, so
every configuration south of the equator stopped at the fetch stage with
``argument --area: expected one argument`` before a byte was downloaded.
The typed command line never saw it, because ``main`` joins a coordinate
flag to its value; the doors that parse a stored argv did not.
