"""The two halves of the stock-WRF inventory contract, held equal.

``woof/wrf_physics_inventory.py`` is the PRODUCER: it derives one
``wrfinput`` package inventory per ``mp_physics`` from WRF v4.6.1
``Registry/Registry.EM_COMMON`` package declarations and field I/O flags,
and ``woof/namelist_compat.py`` publishes those rows inside the
``rw-wps.namelist-support.v1`` report.
``tools/rw_wps/crates/rw-wps/src/namelist.rs`` is the CONSUMER: it
re-validates that report and refuses any ``mp_physics`` it has no evidenced
package contract for.

The concrete breakage this gate prevents: the consumer's id set was written
as a bare ``matches!(domain.mp_physics, 6 | 8 | 10)`` and then stayed there
while the producer grew rows for 18, 28 and 50.  A scheme added to the
producer therefore became UNREACHABLE through the frontend -- the documented
step-one preflight before ``wrfinput_dNN`` is built and an unchanged WRF is
launched -- and said so with a message that named no breakage.  mp=50 (P3
one-category) is the row that made it visible: the producer inventories
``package p3_1category`` in full and the frontend refused the report.

The two directions are bound separately, because they fail differently:

* the consumer must never admit an id the producer cannot inventory, which
  would be a widened gate certifying an unchecked package member list;
* an id the producer inventories and the consumer still refuses must carry a
  RECORDED reason beside the consumer's set, in the pattern
  ``DELIBERATE_STALE_SITES`` established for mp=28.  A silent omission is
  not a refusal.

This is a text property of the Rust source, so it holds with no Rust
toolchain installed.
