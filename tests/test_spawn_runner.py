"""Seam A: SpawnRunner activating a dormant nest inside a REAL runner walk.

The lane left the pieces proven in isolation -- the controller's trigger
arithmetic (tests/test_nest_spawn.py), the materializer's terrain
calibration (tests/test_nest_spawn_init.py) -- plus one hand-written
end-to-end that performed the leg surgery inline.  This file covers the
seam that replaces that inline sequence: the runner that a route mounts
once and consults at every leg boundary.

Everything below walks REAL clocks, a REAL schedule and the REAL
executor; only ``woof.core.dycore.step`` is mocked, because NumPy
states are not valid CUDA integrator inputs -- the same instrument rule
the spawn lane's own end-to-end states.
