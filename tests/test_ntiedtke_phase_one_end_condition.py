"""Phase 1's end condition, stated over the artifact it names.

**The assembled pipeline reproduces ``nt-levels.csv`` bitwise.** Not a
kernel count -- that number has three times measured a smaller thing than
it appeared to (docs/ntiedtke/PORT-RECORD.md §29). This file runs the twenty stages
from the driver inputs and compares the eight tendency columns of
``nt-levels.csv`` and the ``scale_fac``/``scale_fac2``/``raincv``/
``pratec`` columns of ``nt-surface.csv`` against the real WRF driver's own
answer.

AND THE CHUNKING GATE, which no oracle can provide. The cap is 17,920
columns and the fixture is 108, so the end-to-end run above executes
exactly ONE chunk: workspace reuse between chunks, ``llo3`` recomputed
rather than leaked, and no column's state surviving into the next chunk's
lane are all invisible to it. WRF has nothing to disagree with, because
its decomposition is its own (review).

The gate needs no oracle at all: the same 108 columns at caps of 32, 64
and 108 must give **byte-identical** output. Three caps rather than one
makes the claim *"chunking does not change the answer"* rather than *"this
chunking is safe"*.

**IT IS VALID ON THIS FIXTURE FOR A STATED REASON.** ``llo3`` is
chunk-wide, so re-chunking changes its population and could legitimately
change the answer. It cannot here: §12's precondition gate asserts that
every column entering cuascn with ``ldcum`` true carries
``klab(klev) > 0`` -- so ``llo3`` is true for any chunk containing any
such column, including a chunk of one, and is invariant under
re-chunking. (Not "108 of 108": the fixture is 108 columns but the
precondition is over the ones that trigger, and reading it over the wrong
population is how the first draft of the test below reported 60
violations of a property that holds.) **The day
that precondition stops holding, this test stops being valid**, and
:func:`test_the_chunking_gate_rests_on_the_llo3_precondition` is what says
so rather than leaving it to be rediscovered.
