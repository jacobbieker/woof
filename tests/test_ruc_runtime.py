"""RUC, actually forecasting.

Every other RUC test in this repository measures a routine against an oracle
CSV -- 48 fixture cases of ``LSMRUC``, and hundreds more of the leaves under
it.  None of them runs the model.  This one does: ``sf_surface_physics=3``
over mixed land, water and sea ice, stepped through RK3, and it asserts the
things that separate "ported" from "runs":

* the selector reaches RUC and NOT Noah.  That distinction is the whole
  reason value-based dispatch exists (commit 9362172): the driver used to
  branch on the truthiness of ``sf_surface_physics``, so a RUC request would
  have run Noah and produced a plausible forecast with no error;
* the cold start produces a usable state -- SH2O and SMFR3D are not the
  allocation zeros after ``ruclsminit``, because "no frozen water anywhere"
  is a claim, not an absence of one;
* the driver's own ``ktau==1`` repair block fires, so SOILT1/QVG/QSG/RHOSNF
  leave the zeros ``initialize_physics`` allocated;
* the surface fluxes, the nine-level soil column and the runoff accumulators
  actually move, which is what says the scheme is coupled rather than called;
* nothing goes non-finite;
* a restart round trip reproduces every carried array bit for bit AND the
  next step from the restored state is bit identical -- with a companion test
  that perturbs one word and proves that comparison can fail;
* a real wrfout is written and read back with nine soil layers; and
* the two open RUC leads are settled by measurement rather than by argument:
  ``udrunoff`` is shown to be correctly zero on an unsaturated column and
  nonzero when WRF's own condition for it is met, and ``ilnb`` is shown to be
  DEFINED rather than inherited from the previous column.

The grid is small on purpose.  The column runs on the host -- there is no
device ``sfctmp`` and no device ``lsmruc`` in this tree -- so the per-column
cost is milliseconds and a large domain would make this file unrunnable
rather than more convincing.  That cost is the scheme's scaling blocker, it is
published in the registry warnings, and
``test_the_column_cost_is_what_the_registry_says`` measures it instead of
hiding it.

    """Where the one-hour forecast's snow pack went, and why it is not a bug.

    The admitting forecast started with SNOW=15 mm / SNOWH=0.08 m and its
    first wrfout frame, at t=600 s, already read SNOW=0.  That looks like a
    dropped pack, and RUC_SMELT reading 0 in the same frame does not clear it
    -- RUC_SMELT is an instantaneous RATE at frame time, not an accumulator.

    Measured step by step, the pack MELTS: ACSNOM reaches 15.0020 mm against
    15.0 mm of initial SWE over eight 6 s steps, and the budget closes to
    0.03%.  What was wrong was the INITIAL STATE, not the scheme -- a 15 mm
    pack was handed a 303 K skin temperature and a 295..303 K soil column, and
    a warm soil layer holds enough heat to melt it (2.5 MJ m-3 K-1 x 0.05 m x
    27 K is 3.4 MJ m-2 against the 5.0 MJ m-2 the pack needs).  RUC resolving
    that inconsistency immediately is correct behaviour, and TSK dropping
    303 -> 292.5 K in the first step is it happening.

    So the assertion is the CONSERVATION, which holds regardless of how fast
    the melt runs, plus the control that says the melt is driven by the warm
    ground rather than by the scheme leaking mass: an identical pack over
    subfreezing air and soil must keep its SWE and accumulate exactly no melt.

def test_udrunoff_is_zero_because_no_level_oversaturates_and_can_be_nonzero():
    """The ``udrunoff``-is-always-zero lead, settled from the WRF source.

    ``:1041`` is ``udrunoff = udrunoff + runoff2*dt*1000``, and ``runoff2``
    comes from ``SOILMOIST``.  Reading that routine says exactly when it is
    nonzero: ``:5901`` zeroes it on every call, and the ONLY accumulation is
    at ``:6071``/``:6073``, inside ``else if(qq.gt.dqm)`` for levels
    ``k=2..nzs`` -- a SUB-SURFACE level whose implicit solution overshoots
    saturation.  The top level's saturation overshoot goes to ``runoff``
    (surface) instead, at ``:6048``; WRF even has the ``runoff2`` version of
    that line commented out at ``:6043``.

    So ``udrunoff == 0`` in all 48 unsaturated fixture cases is CORRECT and
    not a port defect: none of them drives a deep level past ``dqm``.

    Two things the first attempt at this test got wrong, both found by
    measurement, both worth recording because they are counter-intuitive:

    * RAIN DOES NOT DRIVE ``runoff2``.  Swept over rainbl in
      (0, 1, 10, 40, 200) mm the value is bit-identical -- because
      ``infmax`` caps infiltration at ``:6009`` and every excess millimetre is
      sent to ``runoff`` (surface) at ``:6012``, so water cannot reach a deep
      level fast enough to oversaturate it.  What drives ``runoff2`` is the
      column's INITIAL saturation.
    * the threshold is ``smois >= MAXSMC``, not ``smois > dqm``.  Measured on
      STAS-RUC loam: 0.45 gives exactly zero and 0.451 -- MAXSMC itself, a
      fully saturated column -- gives nonzero.

    The strongest form of the claim is available here and is the one asserted:
    the saturated column is given NO RAIN AT ALL, so it has ``sfcrunoff``
    exactly zero and ``udrunoff`` nonzero -- the exact inverse of the fixture
    pattern that opened the lead (``sfcrunoff`` nonzero in 14 of 48,
    ``udrunoff`` zero in all 48).  Two accumulators that share ``:1040``'s
    shape cannot both be explained by one wiring mistake if each can be made
    to move while the other stays at zero.

    * the column must be FROZEN.  ``soilprop`` rebuilds ``soilice`` from TSO
      and SOILMOIS through the freezing curve (``:2695-2703``) and reads the
      restored SMFR3D only as the cap
      ``soilice(k)=min(soilice(k),smfrkeep(k))`` at ``:2704-2707``, inside

      inside ``if (soilice(k).gt.0.)``.  On the warm grid this file's other
      tests use, 0 of 216 soil cells have KEEPFR3DFLAG==1, so SMFR3D is not
      merely inert there -- it is never read at all.
    * the cell must be one where ``KEEPFR3DFLAG == 1``.  On the frozen grid
      that is 16 of 216 cells and they are all at soil level 1, so the
      obvious ``(0, 0, 0)`` index is the one cell shape that cannot work.
    * the nudge must be DOWNWARD.  The read is a ``min()``; raising a cap
      that is not binding changes nothing.  Measured at the same cell:
