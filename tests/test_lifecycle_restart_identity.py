"""The acceptance test for restart with a declared nest lifecycle.

The contract this file adjudicates is the whole point of the lifecycle
restart work: a run SPLIT at a checkpoint and resumed produces the same
frames and the same final state as the unbroken run, for any number of
segments, at every interesting instant in a lifecycle -- before the slot
fires, in the middle of an episode, exactly on the leg lattice, inside
the re-arm cooldown after a retirement, and in the middle of the second
episode.

What is real here: the experiment, the ``SpawnRunner`` and its policy
tables, ``walk_spawn_legs``, the executor, the clocks and schedules, the
tree checkpoint writer and reader, the lifecycle block, the resume
reconstruction, and the resume boundary pass.  What is stood in is
``woof.core.dycore.step`` -- NumPy states are not valid CUDA integrator
inputs, the same instrument rule ``test_spawn_runner`` states -- and the
history writer, whose file format is not what a restart contract is
about.  The stand-in integrator is a PURE FUNCTION OF STATE, with no
counter of its own, so a split run and an unbroken run see identical
inputs and any difference between them belongs to the restart path.

A "frame payload" below is the sha256 of the state arrays at the history
instant, taken under the pathname the writer set would have chosen for
that domain and episode.  That is the content a wrfout frame is derived
from; hashing the file instead would measure the NetCDF encoder.

Receipts are deliberately OUTSIDE the identity: each segment owns its own
``spawn_receipts.json`` and relocation ledger.  The trajectory and the
frames are the contract.
