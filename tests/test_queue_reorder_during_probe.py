"""A queue reorder that lands while the scheduler reads the card decides which forecast starts next.

The defect: a tick read the line, then read the card outside the lock, then
started the forecast that had been first when it read the line.  A Move made
while the card was being read had already answered ``["second", "first"]``,
yet ``first`` started, so a long earlier forecast delayed the one the user had
just put first.  The line is now compared in the same locked step that marks a
forecast starting, and a changed line sends the scheduler to look again.
