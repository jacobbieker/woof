    and not for the packs FROM it, and a pack reads the interior band the
    next step rewrites in place.  MEASURED on the merge-base engine: one
    card split 2x2, HRRR West Texas lean suite, 3 h, 3 of 6 runs on an RTX
    5090 wrote frames that differ from the unsplit run (first differing step
    19 to 41).  Here every pack is queued behind about 50 ms of other work on
    its copy stream, so a next step that does not wait for it rewrites the
    band before the pack reads it, every time; the slabs must still equal
    the unsplit domain bit for bit.
