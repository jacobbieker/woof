"""Two-way feedback across a MIXED microphysics edge, on the CPU.

Three refusals stood at coupler construction and two of them are retired
here.  The first said two-way feedback "has no ratified reverse mass/moment
mapping"; the second said it "requires identical active parent/child
prognostic field inventories", which is the same predicate restated, a
mixed pair being exactly a pair whose inventories differ.  Neither was a
missing mapping: ``resolve_microphysics_transition`` resolves ordered edges
over the whole ported matrix, so the reverse edge of any accepted forward
edge resolves too, and the CUDA entry is parameterized by
``(source_mp, target_mp)``, is column-local and already takes
``coupled=False``, which is what a restriction reads.  Only the wiring was
missing.  The THIRD refusal, unequal parent/child nz, is a different item
and still stands: the reverse operator has no vertical mapping.

Why a new file rather than tests/test_feedback.py: that module is marked
``gpu`` in its entirety, because its ``_seed_state`` helper imports cupy at
helper scope and tests/conftest.py's ``_cupy_scope`` marks the whole module
when a non-test helper opens a device (verified: 12 deselected, 0
collected under ``-m "not gpu"``).  A test added there would never run in
the CPU gate.  Nothing in this file imports cupy at any scope.
