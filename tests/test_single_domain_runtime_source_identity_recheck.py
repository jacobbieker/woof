"""A git hiccup, or the run's own output, must not destroy its receipt.

``prepared_single_domain_forecast`` snapshots ``_runtime_source_identity()``
when a forecast starts and compares it again at the very END -- after the
physics, after every frame is written -- so that source edited mid-run
cannot ship under the identity the run started with.  That check is worth
keeping.  What ``!=`` could not do was tell three different events apart.

Two of them are not implementation changes at all, and this runner is
exposed to both more badly than the tree runner is:

1. **A transient git failure.**  ``_runtime_source_identity`` builds on
   ``woof.runtime_manifest.provenance(REPO)``, whose checkout branch
   catches ``(OSError, subprocess.SubprocessError)`` and FALLS THROUGH
   to the editable/wheel ladder.  So one flaky ``git rev-parse`` at the
   end of a run re-answers ``identity_source``, ``git_commit``,
   ``git_tree``, ``git_status_short`` and ``installed_wheel`` /
   ``installed_editable`` from a lower rung, all at once, with nothing
   on disk changed -- and the run dies on ``forecast runtime
   implementation changed during run``.

2. **The run's own scratch files.**  ``git_status_short`` is part of
   this identity, and ``git status --short`` lists untracked files.
   ``runs/`` is not ignored (measured in this worktree: 0 status lines
   before ``touch runs/probe``, 1 after), so a run that writes inside
   the checkout fails its own receipt for having produced output.  On an
   editable install it moves twice over, because
   ``installed_editable.git.untracked_files`` counts the same rows.

Fixing (1) surfaced a third thing, measured against the real resolver
rather than reasoned about: the fall-through does not merely LOSE the
git answer here, it substitutes a DIFFERENT TREE's.  ``pip install -e``
points at the main checkout, so in a linked worktree -- which is where
this project's work happens -- the editable rung answered ``c1b32d0``
while the code being hashed was ``eada530d``.  The two ends of a healthy
run were comparing two unrelated commits.  So the git half is re-read
from REPO's own ``.git`` whenever a rung that speaks for another tree
answers, and the rung-specific artifacts are compared only within one
rung.

Both halves of the bar are here: none of these events may be reported as
a change, and a HEAD that really moves -- or a tracked source that is
really edited -- must still be.
