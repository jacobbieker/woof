"""Every composition the loader accepts must also PRICE.

THE BLIND SPOT THIS CLOSES
    ``tools/report_physics_composition_walk.py`` measures one gate:
    :func:`woof.experiment.build_experiment`.  A row it marks ACCEPTED
    means the loader resolved the TOML into per-domain ``RunConfig``s with
    every selector preserved -- and nothing more.  The memory preflight is
    a SECOND gate, reached on every real run:
    ``woof/core/model.py`` calls
    :func:`woof.core.preflight.estimate_experiment` unconditionally while
    building the model, and ``woof check`` is that call and little else.
    Its selector tables (``_MICROPHYSICS_KERNEL_MODULES``,
    ``_PBL_KERNEL_MODULES``, ``_SURFACE_LAYER_KERNEL_MODULES``, ...) are
    FAIL-CLOSED: a selector value with no kernel-module row raises rather
    than pricing zero.

    So a scheme could be admitted by the loader, advertised in the schema
    menu, swept by the composition walk, recorded ACCEPTED in a published
    receipt -- and still be unable to run, because nothing ever asked the
    preflight to price it.  That is not hypothetical.  It shipped twice
    into the 1.9 assembly:

      * ``mp_physics = 50`` (P3 one-category) -- accepted at
        woof/config.py's inline mp check, absent from
        ``_MICROPHYSICS_KERNEL_MODULES``;
      * ``bl_pbl_physics = 2`` / ``sf_sfclay_physics = 2`` (MYJ + the Eta
        surface layer) -- accepted via ``PBL_SCHEMES`` /
        ``SURFACE_LAYER_SCHEMES``, absent from both PBL tables.

    Both were caught by a human reading the tables, which is the failure
    mode this file exists to retire.  A new scheme that reaches the loader
    without a kernel-module row now fails HERE, on every cut, by name.

WHAT IS MEASURED
    The receipt's ``accepted_combinations`` -- the measured accepted set,
    regenerated and byte-compared by
    ``tests/test_physics_composition_walk.py`` -- is decoded back into
    combinations, rebuilt through the same front door, and pushed through
    ``estimate_experiment``.  Decoding is not trusted: every key must
    round-trip through the walk's own ``key_of``, and every rebuild must
    still be ACCEPTED, so a lossy decode fails loudly instead of quietly
    testing something else.

WHAT CARD IT PRICES ON
    Every composition is priced on ONE explicit profile,
    :data:`PRICING_PROFILE`: the reference card's geometry carrying the
    compile platform of the tree's first Noah-MP composed-unit recording
    (:data:`woof.core.kernel_frame_recordings.NOAHMP_COMPOSED_FRAME_RECORDINGS`).
    Given a profile, the estimator reads no device, so the walk's outcome
    is the same on a box with a card, on a box without one, and under
    ``GPUWM_NO_LOCAL_GPU`` -- and ``sf_surface_physics = 4`` prices from
    its recorded row instead of refusing because the machine running the
    suite was never read.  (Before this profile the walk priced with no
    profile at all, which for scheme 4 means "read this machine's card":
    green under the switch only because a declared rule excused the
    refusal, red the moment a recorded card was visible.)  The estimator's
    card-class refusals for scheme 4 -- absent, unread, unrecorded, stale
    -- are held by ``tests/test_noahmp_frame_provenance.py``, not here.

WHAT A REFUSAL IS ALLOWED TO BE
    Not every accepted composition has to price.  A preflight refusal is
    legitimate when it is a DECLARED rule: a stated, reasoned refusal that
    names the way through, rather than a missing table row.  Those live in
    :data:`DECLARED_PRICING_RULES`, one entry each, with the predicate
    that says which compositions it may fire on.  A refusal matching no
    declared rule is a defect.  A declared rule that fires on nothing is
    dead text and also fails -- the escape hatch is not allowed to grow
    quietly.  The list is empty right now: every composition the loader
    accepts prices.
