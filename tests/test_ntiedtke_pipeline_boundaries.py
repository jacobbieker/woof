"""The assembled pipeline, graded at EVERY stage boundary.

Phase 1's end condition is that the assembled pipeline reproduces
``nt-levels.csv`` bitwise -- **graded at every capture boundary, not only
end to end**. End-to-end agreement would say "the answer is right"; a
boundary grade says which stage is wrong, and the difference is the whole
reason the capture files exist.

IT IS ALSO WHAT ESTABLISHES THE LEVEL BASE. Four static derivations gave
four answers (docs/ntiedtke/PORT-RECORD.md §32, §35), so ``NT_LEVEL_BASE`` is a PRIOR
and these grades are its test: a wrong base fails at its own stage, by
name, because :meth:`NtWorkspace.levels` reads the same rows whatever base
a stage was bound with (``test_ntiedtke_workspace.py``).

The fixture is 108 columns -- 18 cases across the six-member dx sweep --
which is one chunk. The multi-chunk path is a separate gate; see the note
at the foot of this file.
