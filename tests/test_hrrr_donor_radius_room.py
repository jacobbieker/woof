"""A 3 km HRRR root takes the widest soil donor search wherever it sits.

The breakage this guards: every HRRR target carried a fixed 8-cell
(24 km) soil donor search, so a fitted 3 km root over the Gulf coast
failed its preparation with "no valid surface-matched HRRR donor within
8 cells" while its own refusal measured that 14 cells reach one.  The
search then shrank back toward 8 near an edge of HRRR's grid, where a
wider search box was refused; the box now stops at HRRR's own edge, so
the widest search is given everywhere.
