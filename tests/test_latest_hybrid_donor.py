"""``--cycle latest`` for a hybrid route resolves a cycle it can fetch whole.

AIGFS and AIGEFS take their land surface from the same-cycle GDAS
analysis, which publishes after the AI atmosphere.  Latest used to ask
only about the atmosphere, picked the newest cycle, and the fetch then
refused it because its GDAS analysis was not out yet, telling the reader
to pass --cycle latest, which they had.  The cycle before had
everything.
