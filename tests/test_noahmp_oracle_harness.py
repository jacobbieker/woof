"""Negative controls for the Noah-MP leaf-visibility exposure gate.

`tools/noahmp_wrf461_oracle/build_leaves.sh` compiles a *visibility-patched*
copy of `phys/module_sf_noahmplsm.F` so the 50 `private ::` leaf routines can
be called from a separate program unit.  `check_visibility_patch.py` is the
entire safety argument for that edit, so it needs its own negative controls:
`tests/test_noahmp_oracle.py` checks that the committed patch *body* is
visibility-only, but nothing there checks that the auditor would **reject** a
patched source that is not.

That distinction matters more than it looks, because of the order the auditor
runs its checks in.  `audit()` verifies three pinned SHA-256 digests *first*
and only then compares the two sources line by line.  So on today's committed
bytes the structural checks are unreachable -- any perturbation is caught by
the hash, and checks 4-7 never execute.

They stop being unreachable the moment somebody adds a leaf.  Lifting a 51st
symbol changes the patch, which changes `PATCH_SHA256` and `PATCHED_SHA256`,
and a fresh agent updating those pins is *supposed* to update them to whatever
their new file hashes to.  At that instant the hash gate is satisfied by
construction and the line-by-line audit is the only thing standing between the
project and an arbitrary edit to a pinned physics source.

These tests therefore drive the structural checks with the hash gate satisfied,
which is the state a re-pinning agent will actually be in.  They run on a
synthetic module of the same shape so they need neither WSL nor the pinned WRF
tree; the build-level control against the real 9,300-line source is
`tools/noahmp_wrf461_oracle/build_visibility_crosscheck.sh`.
