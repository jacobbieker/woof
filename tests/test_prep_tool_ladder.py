"""The prep front door resolves its GRIB2 tools; the flags are overrides.

The papercut these tests close, measured on the release line at
a4995ee07: ``woof prep --source hrrr-prs`` -- and every other
packaged-profile GRIB2 source, the generic mapped GRIB2 route and the
20CRv3 run route -- refused with ``--grib2-dump is required for mapped
grib2`` on a box where ``woof fetch-bridges`` had already staged both
tools and ``woof doctor`` printed them verified.  The ENGINE
(``mapped_source._build_grib2_tools``) had consulted the shared ladder
since 2.4; the FRONT DOOR never asked it and demanded flags instead.

The contract now, after the compose port.  ``compose`` is declared for
``grib2`` in ``mapped_engine_bridge.ENGINE_CAPABILITIES``, and
``woof.mapped_direct`` asks the engine for ``compose`` on every call
(``MAPPED_ROUTE_SUBCOMMAND``), so the mapped GRIB2 route -- packaged
profiles and the generic spelling alike -- does its byte work in
process on the default engine.  That splits this file's rows in two,
and the split is the contract:

* on the DEFAULT engine the two tool paths are not wanted, not
  resolved, and above all not FORWARDED.  Forwarding a resolved tool is
  not merely redundant: naming a subprocess decoder is the spelling
  that routes a call back to the Python engine
  (``_mapped_engine_choice``), so a door that forwarded what it found
  would un-default the Rust engine on every box that ran
  ``woof fetch-bridges``.  The rows below assert the bare door on an
  estate with NOTHING staged and no crate -- which is what a wheel
  install is -- and again on a staged estate, where the staged copies
  must stay out of the command.
* on the WORKAROUND engine (``GPUWM_MAPPED_ENGINE=python``, the
  documented spelling for routing around a Rust decode defect) the
  Python route runs the two executables, so every rung of the original
  papercut still has to hold there, and it is asserted by EXECUTING the
  door rather than by describing it:

  - omitted, the two tool paths resolve through the same ladder every
    other bridge uses (environment override, checkout build, staged
    ``~/.woof/bridges``, wheel), through the same resolver the engine
    runs, so the pre-flight and the route cannot disagree;
  - passed, the flags override the ladder exactly as the per-tool
    environment variables always have -- and naming one is itself a
    request for the Python engine, so those rows need no engine pin;
  - unresolvable, the refusal is the install-aware remedy doctor prints
    -- never a demand for a flag pointing at a file the user does not
    have;
  - a resolved binary that predates this release's decoder contract is
    refused BY NAME when nothing here can rebuild it, because handing
    the route a stale decoder is the 1.1.0 series-file failure again;
  - usage errors still lead: an argument-vocabulary mistake is reported
    before the estate is consulted, so a reader fixes their command line
    once.

The 20CRv3 run route follows the engine table like every composed door:
``woof.twentycrv3_wrf`` routes through ``decode_composed_source`` and
reads the raw record inventory in process on the bare default, so its
ladder rows below hold BOTH halves -- no tools forwarded bare, both
resolved on the documented Python-engine workaround.  Its old
engine-unconditional row was the last ``ENGINE_GAPS`` entry.

Which SUBCOMMAND the route runs decides whether the tools are wanted at
all, and that question lives in ``mapped_engine_bridge`` -- see
``tests/test_mapped_compose_tool_forwarding.py``, which runs the
composed invocation this door prints, and states the no-forwarding
invariant over the whole source registry.
