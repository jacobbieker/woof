"""The horizontal operator's own undershoot on the direct specific-humidity lane.

An ERA5 (keyless ARCO) window sized for a 16 GiB card refused in
initialization with ``specific humidity must be finite in [0, 1)`` while
the same centre sized for an 8 GiB card ran end to end.  Nothing in the
forcing was out of range: all 1,497,834 specific-humidity values in the
published file are positive, the smallest being 2.533852239139378e-09
(``proof/source-spfh-extremes-tip.txt``, which carries the fetch command,
the published file's sha256 and the count, minimum and maximum read back
through this tree's own decoder).  The refused values are made by WPS's
overlapping-parabolic ``sixteen_pt``, which this tree runs to map that
source onto the model grid and which overshoots in both directions.
Whether a window met a cell where it undershoots is a question of how
much ground the window covers, so the SIZING decided whether the forcing
was admissible.

The numbers below are measured, at 27.5N 82.5W, on the 12/3 km ladder,
ERA5 cycle 2025-08-15T00.  The mapped probes were taken on an RTX 5070 Ti
and the device-memory peaks on both that card and an RTX 4090; each one
names the receipt it came from.
