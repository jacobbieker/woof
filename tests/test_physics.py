"""``woof/core/physics.py`` as woof's ``phys/module_physics_init.F``.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
``initialize_physics`` is woof's ``phy_init``.  WRF's ``phy_init`` ends with
a call to ``mp_init`` (``phys/module_physics_init.F:1635``), and ``mp_init``'s
``CASE (THOMPSONAERO)`` arm (``:4522-4538``) calls ``thompson_init`` -- which
is where WRF installs the synthetic CCN/IN profile whenever the water- and
ice-friendly aerosol fields arrive unset
(``phys/module_mp_thompson.F:493-515`` for CCN, ``:531-551`` for IN).

For four waves woof had the fill (``woof.core.microphysics.
microphysics_init``, oracle-gated against WRF's own post-``thompson_init``
snapshot) and NO PRODUCTION CALLER.  Every mp=28 forecast therefore started at
``nwfa = nifa = 0`` and was clamped to WRF's floors at
``module_mp_thompson.F:3979-3982`` -- a maritime-clean CCN population
everywhere, for the whole run, with nothing NaN, nothing negative and no
health check tripped.  Measured over 150 steps it was worth 5.6x fewer cloud
droplets and +74.2% domain-total RAINNC
(``tests/test_mp28_forecast_smoke.py::
test_the_aerosol_profile_changes_the_forecast_measurably``).

This file gates the wiring, and it gates the three properties that make the
wiring correct rather than merely present:

1. it runs, and it installs WRF's own arithmetic (not "the field became
   nonzero");
2. it runs EXACTLY ONCE per domain -- a per-step call would overwrite an
   advected, activated and scavenged aerosol field with the synthetic profile
   every single step, which is a worse bug than the one being fixed;
3. it is RESTART-SAFE -- ``thompson_init`` reaches its fill through two
   independent ``MAXVAL`` presence tests (``:493`` and ``:531``), so a domain
   that already carries aerosol (a resumed checkpoint, or a future WIF
   ingest) is left bit-for-bit untouched.

It also gates the rest of mp=28's physics-driver admission, each against the
WRF line that puts 28 in the set rather than against mp=8's spelling.

    So the resumed domain integrates the CHECKPOINTED aerosol, and the

    property a user cares about, it is not the same property as the presence
    guard, and before the init call was wired it could not be asked at all.
