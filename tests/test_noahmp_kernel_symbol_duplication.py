"""How much the Noah-MP kernels duplicate, and where the copies have drifted.

``woof/core/noahmp_kernel_sources.py`` states that glibc's ``powf``/``expf``/
``logf`` are "transcribed **once** in this tree, in ``noahmp_leaves.cu``,
because two copies of a 32-entry constant table can drift and only one of them
would be audited".  That is the right reason.  It is also no longer true: five
other kernels carry their own transcriptions under a different spelling
(``glibc_powf`` rather than ``r_pow``), in three mutually different
generations.  The drift the docstring was written to prevent has happened, out
of sight of the naming convention that was supposed to prevent it.

This matters beyond tidiness.  The remaining route to the device ceiling is to
compose Noah-MP's ENERGY subsystems into one translation unit, and every one of
these symbols then collides.  The lane's own report recorded that step as
"merging ten proved-identical device copies", i.e. free.  It is not free:

* ``f_min``/``f_max`` come in two orderings, ``(a < b) ? a : b`` and
  ``(b < a) ? b : a``.  These agree on ordinary values and disagree on
  **signed zeros and NaN** -- ``f_min(+0.0, -0.0)`` is ``-0.0`` under the first
  and ``+0.0`` under the second.  ``-ftz=true`` is appended by CuPy
  unconditionally and gfortran does not flush, so signed zeros are exactly the
  input class this project has already been bitten by three times.  Picking
  either spelling for a merged definition changes the other group's arithmetic
  until each call site is shown not to reach a signed zero.
* ``glibc_powf`` comes in three.  ``noahmp_water.cu`` carries two early exits
  (``1**y`` and ``+0 ** finite-positive``) that ``noahmp_bareflux.cu`` lacks,
  and its own comment records why: "CANWATER hits it whenever FWET is exactly
  0, which is every dry-canopy case".  Without them ``bareflux``'s copy returns
  NaN for a zero base.  That is **not** a live defect there -- WRF's SFCDIF1
  (phys/module_sf_noahmplsm.F) computes ``MOZ`` and ``MOZ2`` from the same
  Monin-Obukhov length with positive numerators, so ``MOZ < 0`` implies
  ``MOZ2 < 0`` and both bases exceed one whenever the branch is taken -- but it
  is a difference a merge has to resolve deliberately rather than by whichever
  copy happens to be pasted first.
* ``noahmp_vegeflux.cu`` is an older generation throughout: ``uint32_t``
  spellings, a ``USE_DEVICE_LIBM`` escape (negative-control only, and not
  reached on the shipped path), and **literal float constants** where the newer
  files use ``__constant__`` tables.  ptxas 12.x mis-folds FP32 ties at compile
  time and ``__constant__`` is the only barrier this project has measured to
  work, so that generation is the one to retire, not the one to merge onto.
  Its ``expf`` overflow threshold is the adjacent float to the newer one
  (``88.72283935546875f`` against a double ``88.72283172607422``), which makes
  the two disagree at exactly one input.

So the inventory is pinned here rather than asserted away.  A merge can shrink
it one symbol at a time, with each step re-gated against that consumer's own
oracle; what it must not do is grow, and no new duplicate may appear
unrecorded.
