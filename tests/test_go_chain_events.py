"""`woof go` leaves its stage timings on disk, without being asked.

The 2026-08-16 pre-sim profiling audit measured a bare `woof go` and
found that answering "how long from launch to sim step 1?" required
assembling five sources by hand -- a wrapper's timestamps, terminal
prose, proof.json, report.json, progress.jsonl -- because the chain
printed every number it computed and persisted none of them.

These tests hold the instrument that closes that: an events.jsonl in
run-plan's own grammar, written by default, replayable by run-plan's own
reader, whose stages account for the process.
