"""The hydrostatic consistency instrument, validated in both directions.

Every pre-existing gate on the restart path is an IDENTITY gate, and a DA
increment must break identity by construction, so none of them can see a
state whose carried diagnostics describe the pre-analysis atmosphere.
This instrument can -- but only if it is proved to read zero on a clean
state and to read loud on a dirty one, with its own noise floor printed
so nobody later tunes the threshold below what it can resolve.

The both-directions discipline is why this file carries a NEGATIVE
CONTROL for every correction made to the instrument.  The correction
that added the vertical metric ``zz`` to the equation of state removed a
false alarm; a correction that removes a false alarm is exactly the kind
that can install a blind spot in its place, so each of these clean-state
tests is paired with a dirty state built on the SAME metric that the
instrument must still reject.
