"""Checkpointing and restart keep the promises the product publishes.

Three findings from the v1.4.0 fleet test, each of which is either a
feature that must work or a truth that must be told before the run
rather than after it:

* **C-04** -- the prepared single-domain route now uses the canonical
  checkpoint transport. Wizard defaults, check and resume must describe
  that current capability and preserve an explicit checkpoints-off choice.
* **C-11** -- on the one route that can checkpoint, restart refused
  every config change ``woof run --restart`` documents as permitted,
  as an unhandled traceback.  Disposition: MAKE IT WORK, and refuse the
  genuine mismatches by name.
* **C-10** -- a ``run_seconds`` off the step grid passed ``woof check``
  and died in a traceback at forecast, while the identical arithmetic
  error on the two cadence keys was refused cleanly at admission.
  Disposition: REFUSE IT WHERE ITS SIBLINGS ARE REFUSED.
