"""One GRIB decoder for the whole tree, and the pins that keep it one.

Until 2026-08-16 this repository carried TWO vendored `grib-core`
directories, both declaring ``name = "grib-core", version = "0.1.0"``, so
Cargo could not tell them apart and neither could a reader.  They had
diverged in one direction that mattered: the copy four of the five
consumer manifests pointed at -- the renderer and ingest path -- was the
copy WITHOUT ``missing_value_management``.

The concrete breakage each test below prevents is named on the test, and
they are all the same family of breakage: a decoder fix that lands in one
copy while the shipped path reads the other.  That is not hypothetical.
It is what let a complex-packed GRIB2 message (Template 5.2 or 5.3) that
declares in-band missing values decode the encoder's missing-value
markers as physical data on the renderer path for two release lines,
silently, with no error and no NaN.

These are text gates on purpose: they read manifests and a provenance
note, need no Rust toolchain and no card, and so they run on every
commit rather than at a cut.  What they cannot check is that the decoder
is correct -- that is the crate's own suite, and
``tools/battery/cargo_gates.txt`` is the leg that runs it.
