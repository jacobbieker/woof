"""A run-plan or hosted-go forecast's writes and final beats reach its heartbeat.

The runtime announces a write between two steps and each beat after the
last step only to a progress object that has the ``writing``, ``written``
and ``finalizing`` hooks.  ``RunObserver`` and ``_GoObserver`` forwarded
``preparing`` and not those three, so ``run-progress.json`` said
"integrating" through a long frame write and the checkpoint read-back, and
the write was timed as a model step.
