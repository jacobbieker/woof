WRF's ``clos_choice`` (``ichoice`` in module_cu_gf_deep.F) is 0 for the
mean of the sixteen closure members and 1..16 for one member alone; the
kernel carries every value (woof/core/gf.py hands it to
gf_gfdrv_stage).  The device proof that each member matches the float32
reference is tests/test_gf_closure_choice_cuda.py; this file holds the
