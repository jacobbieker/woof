"""``woof fetch-bridges``: staging, verification, and refusal contract.

The wheel ships no compiled Rust, so for a pip install this fetch path
IS the install path for nine artifacts: every byte must be verified
against the packaged pins before anything lands in ``~/.woof/bridges``,
a mismatch must be refused rather than installed, and the other
platform's bundle must be recognised as such instead of half-staged.

Nothing here fabricates a hash.  The synthetic-payload tests pin bytes
this file just wrote, by hashing them; the integration tests pack a real
bundle out of the Rust artifacts this machine has actually built and pin
*those* bytes with the release tool the release workflow runs.  Every
test but one runs entirely offline, and that one is gated twice.
