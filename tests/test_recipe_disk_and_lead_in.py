"""The event page's layouts count their download and preparation, and time them from their own source.

Breakage these prevent, measured on a development machine on 2026-09-26: the event page
projected the 2021-12-10 tornado's 12 GB layout at 15.2 GiB and picked it
for a disk with 24 GiB free, and the run had written 28.9 GB by its first
forecast step (18.9 GB of HRRR files and 9.6 GB of preparation); and the
page promised 15 minutes to all pictures for that layout, whose download
and preparation alone took 707 s, because every unmeasured row was given
the two minute mean of the measured ERA5 runs.
