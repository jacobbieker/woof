"""The ``[output]`` history-variable surface: grammar, presets, refusals.

Storage is the breakage this feature prevents.  A four-domain run writing
the full history inventory every period fills a disk with fields nobody
reads; WRF's own answer is ``iofields_filename``, and this is woof's.

Every test here is about the SURFACE -- what a config may say, what it
refuses, and what a refusal tells the reader.  The writer-side proof (a
trimmed frame really is smaller) lives in ``tests/test_wrfout.py``, and
the artifact proof is a real sim.
