"""#234: the MPAS render bridge is a reference generator, not a product path.

``tools/mpas_render_bridge/`` is 1,722 lines of data-path Python: it reads an
MPAS history file, regrids every field onto a structured window and writes the
NetCDF frame the renderer draws.  Read, regrid, write -- three of the four
things the 2.5 Python boundary names as Rust-only.

The Rust crate ``rw-mpas`` (binary ``rw_mpas_convert``) now does all of it on
the release line, proven bit for bit against this exact pair in
``evidence/rw-mpas-converter-parity.json``.  So the pair stays as the
reference that receipt is about -- deleting it would make the parity claim
unreproducible -- but a bare run of either script must refuse and hand the
user the Rust command, or the demotion is a comment rather than a fact.

These tests drive the real scripts as subprocesses, never an import of their
internals.
