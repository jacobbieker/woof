"""Correlation-coefficient QC: the per-moment mask, and what it must not eat.

Every ``SuperobParams`` here states ``dealias=None``.  Dealiasing is what a
bare parameter object does now, and every A/B below is an A/B about the CC
mask: a run with the unfolder in it would be comparing two things at once.


The disaster case for this project is the mask working exactly as
configured and deleting the storm: hail cores run RhoHV 0.85-0.95, the
melting layer 0.90-0.97, and the tornadic debris signature falls below
0.8 at the mesocyclone couplet itself.  So the reflectivity survival
tests here are not smoke tests, they are the specification: high
reflectivity is never CC-dropped from the *echo*, whatever its RhoHV.
Each survival case ships beside its perturbed control -- the same RhoHV
with the reflectivity lowered, which must die -- so a test cannot pass
by the mask simply doing nothing.

Velocity is the other half of the specification and it runs the other
way.  The 2026-08-05 owner ruling is purity-first: a low-RhoHV gate
loses its velocity at every reflectivity, debris core included, because
debris is centrifuged and does not track the air.  These tests pin that
asymmetry moment by moment -- the same gate, kept in one field and
dropped in the other -- so that a future edit cannot quietly restore
the shield to velocity or quietly withdraw it from reflectivity.

The absence tests encode the other contract: a volume, sweep or gate
with no RhoHV passes through byte-identical to the pre-dual-pol
behaviour, and the absence is counted, never converted into a verdict.

The split-cut tests encode what a real 2026 KDMX volume proved: at
split-cut tilts the dual-pol moments ride the surveillance (CS) half
only, so the Doppler (CD) half -- the only velocity there is at the
lowest tilts -- must borrow its neighbour's RhoHV or go unmasked.
