"""``woof dual-run``: one row per capsule field, and no field exempt.

The 5090 carries no ECC, so a bit that flips in VRAM is reported by nothing.
Running the same configuration twice and comparing the two capsules is the
detector.  A detector with an ignore list is a detector with a blind spot, so
this suite mutates *every* leaf of a matched capsule -- every pin, every
schedule entry, every inventory entry, every scalar, every wrfout SHA-256,
every per-domain trajectory digest -- and requires the shipped command to
refuse each one by name.

The table is not a list anybody maintains: it is generated from the capsule
itself, and a meta-test holds that generated set against the capsule schema,
so a field added to the schema later cannot escape it.
