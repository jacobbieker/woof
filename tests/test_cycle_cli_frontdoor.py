"""``woof cycle`` must reach the capability, not just describe it.

Everything the cycle has ever demonstrated -- a real anchor per boundary,
the armed clock triple, the three-hash ingestion gate on both arms, a
child placed on a real echo -- ran through ``tools/cycle_demo_*.py``.  The
product door reached NONE of it: ``_engine_for`` handed the supervisor a
closure that returned two integers, so the CLI cycled a clock over an
empty root and wrote a receipt that looked exactly like a run.

These tests are the door's own reachability proof.  Every one of them is
BEHAVIOURAL -- a missing flag fails as a wrong answer, never as an
ImportError -- and every one is red on revert.
