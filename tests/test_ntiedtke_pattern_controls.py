"""Every pattern-driven gate in this port gets a NEGATIVE control.

WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is a class rather than an instance (review).
Five regex-coverage failures in this port. Four were **under-matching** --
the pattern saw less than its corpus:

* ``audit_intent_aliasing``'s ``DECL`` never matched intent-less dummies
* the non-mutation claims matcher was blind to the "never read" family
* the duplicate-procedure pattern saw only ``real(kind=kind_phys) function``
* and then matched **nothing**, its ``\\b`` having become a 0x08 byte

Every vacuity guard retrofitted after those asks one question: *did the
pattern find enough?* Floors, minimum counts, named things that must
appear. **All of them pass more easily as the match set grows.**

The fifth failure was **over-matching**. ``NtWorkspace.resolve`` matched
``"copy of"`` as well as ``"alias of"``, collapsing ``zqq`` onto ``pqte``
and ``ztt`` onto ``ptte`` -- snapshots read as second names for one
storage. The post-conversion computes ``ptte - ztt``; collapsed, it
computes ``ptte - ptte`` and returns **zero convective heating on every
column**, finite and plausible. No floor, no minimum, no vacuity guard
could have seen it.

So the guard family was one-sided. This is the other half: for each
pattern, something it must NOT match, chosen to be the nearest thing that
would be wrong.
