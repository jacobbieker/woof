"""``woof go`` refuses on the tile PLANNER, never on the planning REPORT.

The planning report (``streaming.tree_road_plan``) promises never to raise:
it runs inside pricing surfaces that answer before the user spends anything.
Until this file existed the promise was kept by a bare ``except Exception``
that wrote the exception's text into the SAME attribute a genuine planner
refusal used, and ``woof go`` read that attribute as a refusal -- so a
``TypeError`` anywhere in the pricing walk blocked a tree that runs, and
did so even on the branch whose comment says "never refuse on a card we
cannot see" (ENG-014).
