"""The observation-grid lane, finally reached from a door.

``rw_obsgrid`` renders five products from a ``gpuwm-obs.radar-grid.v1``
observation volume and has existed, wrapped and handshaken, with no
caller at all: the two DA render tools printed it as a HINT and drew the
same fields in matplotlib.  These cases stub the binary, so they run with
no build.
