"""Hand-built launch tuples must match the kernel signature's arity.

CLASS 2, in docs/ntiedtke/STANDING-RULES.md section 1's sense: WRF cannot
disagree with a launch tuple.  There is no Fortran analogue to grade it
against, so parity is structurally blind and ``max_ulp == 0`` passes no
matter how wrong the tuple is.  The rule says such a thing needs its own
gate; this is that gate.

It exists because 49a3f357 added ``int tiedtke_closure`` to
``ntiedtke_mfub`` and ``ntiedtke_closure`` immediately before ``ncol``,
and the two hand-built launches in test_ntiedtke_prep_parity.py kept
their old tuples.  Every argument after the insertion point shifted:
``nz`` was read from ``dt``.  CuPy does NOT check arity against the
compiled signature -- there is no ``num_args`` on a RawKernel -- so the
launch ACCESS-VIOLATED and took the whole pytest process down with a
Windows fatal exception rather than failing one test.  The forecast was
bitwise-exact throughout, because the production path builds its
arguments from the signature tables in ntiedtke.py; only a caller that
writes the tuple by hand could break, and only the tests do that.

So: a bitwise forecast gate says nothing about a kernel the forecast
never launches this way, and that is precisely the blindness section 1
is about.
