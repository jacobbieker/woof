"""Dealiasing is what a bare radar ingest does, and off is what gets spelled.

The four risk masks find SIGNATURES of aliasing, not aliasing.  A spatially
coherent fold covering a whole region has a present and plausible Nyquist,
speeds well inside the reject fraction, no in-cell spread and no gate-to-gate
jump in its interior: it passes every one of them and reaches the filter as a
smooth, plausible, wrong wind field.  The unfolder that excludes that case was
implemented, vendored and named the shipped default engine, and then left
behind a ``store_true`` flag on every door.  "Off is not a decision at all"
was the documented claim; it was a decision, made by omission, for every run
that did not know to ask.

Everything here is on parameter objects and parsers: no scipy, no Rust
bridge, no volume.
