"""The preparation's decoded frame stream is priced before the download.

A chain that composes through the mapped engine stages every decoded valid
time in a scratch folder while it prepares, sized by the SOURCE grid.  The
disk check before the download priced the target grid only, so a GEM GDPS
48 hour window, whose stream is about 82 GB, was admitted onto a disk that
could not hold it; the engine then refused it itself, but only after the
whole download and the first valid time's decode.

These cells hold the table rows to the mapping documents they price and to
the engine's own figures, and hold ``run-plan``/``go`` to refusing, before
anything is fetched, a run whose frame stream does not fit, naming the
scratch folder and WOOF_COMPOSE_SCRATCH.
