"""A parent history refusal blames the file only when the file is at fault.

Opening a parent history file that is truncated or corrupt refuses in one
sentence naming the file and saying to restore or regenerate it.  That
remedy is the file's.  A missing, stale or incompatible ``rw_netcdf`` (or a
``WOOF_RW_NETCDF`` naming nothing) is the reader's failure: translated as
well, it called a healthy parent damaged, told its reader to run the parent
again (hours of GPU), and cut off the reader's own build instructions.
These tests hold both halves.
