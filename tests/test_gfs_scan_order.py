"""The GFS matched pairs, and whether upstream still agrees.

``gfs_grib2_bridge`` accepts both published row orders (normalizing to
one) and both published packings: the NOMADS crop's DRT 5.0 and the raw
S3 objects' DRT 5.3, the latter certified by the SOILW missing-value
pair.  The bit-identity proofs live in Rust, where the decoder is
(``a_flipped_raw_s3_decode_is_bit_identical_to_the_nomads_crop`` and
``the_raw_53_bitmap_decode_matches_the_nomads_crop_cell_for_cell``);
what lives here is each pair's identity -- so a fixture cannot be
swapped for something that no longer demonstrates the point -- and one
live check that upstream has not changed its packing or row order since
the pairs were captured.

See ``tests/fixtures/gfs-scan-order/README.md`` for provenance.
