"""Runtime contracts for the nest lifecycle: output episodes, retirement,
independent followers, and the restart refusal.

The policy half of the lifecycle is covered by ``test_nest_lifecycle.py``.
This file drives the RUNTIME objects the lifecycle series added -- the
writer set's pathname selection, ``RelocationRunnerCollection``,
``SpawnRunner``'s retirement branch and ``_detach_retired_children`` --
because a policy that decides correctly and a runtime that wires it
wrongly are indistinguishable from the policy tests alone.

Two defects this file exists to keep closed, both DEFAULT-PATH
regressions rather than lifecycle bugs:

* a plain one-shot ``spawn`` config (no retire/rearm) must keep writing
  the FLAT ``wrfout_dNN_*`` pathname it has always written.  Episode
  numbering engages on a declared lifecycle table, not on the mere fact
  that a nest was spawned;
* the duplicate-valid-time guard must refuse a duplicate produced WITHIN
  one run and must NOT refuse a re-run into a previous run's output
  directory, which has always overwritten through the atomic replace.

Stand-ins here replace COLLABORATORS (the async writer thread, the
route's child preparer), never the code under test.
