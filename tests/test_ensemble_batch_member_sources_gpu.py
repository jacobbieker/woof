"""Members with different inputs, packed on one card, against their own ordinary runs.

Every member starts from the retained real WRF inputs but owns its own
initialized words at the bootstrap seam: the existing seeded wind increment
plus a seeded skin and soil temperature offset written into its initialized
physics driver. Each member's ordinary run is the reference. The native pack
is built the way the production handoff builds it for time-lagged and
multi-model members: the first member stays live as the root, every other
member is bootstrapped through its own ordinary initializer, snapshotted to
host, released, and bound to the root as a member source. Every state,
physics and output word of every member must match its ordinary run, and
the aggregate products must match byte for byte.
