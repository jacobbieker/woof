"""The per-thread local-frame table is a RECORDING, and it says whose.

``KERNEL_MAX_LOCAL_SIZE_BYTES`` prices the launch-time local-memory
backing store, which is the largest single term in the non-pool device
budget (5.7 GiB for one kf launch on a 170-SM card).  Every row of it is
a number NVRTC produced for ONE target architecture with ONE compiler
build, and until 2026-08-20 the module carried those numbers as if they
were a property of the source.

They are not.  Measured the same NVRTC-plus-driver way on three compile
platforms:

Four rows move with the ARCHITECTURE at a fixed compiler, four move with
the COMPILER BUILD at a fixed architecture, and one moves with both.  So
the table is a joint property of (target architecture, NVRTC build), and
the only accurate form for it is a set of named recordings plus a ceiling
over them.

These tests need no device: they check the shape of the recording and the
arithmetic of the ceiling.  ``tests/test_preflight.py::
test_the_recorded_local_frames_match_the_driver`` is the leg that puts a
real compiler behind them.
