"""The ``RUC_NZS`` tier ladder, and the proof it changed nothing at nine.

``woof/core/kernels/ruc.cu`` sized every per-thread soil scratch array with a
bare literal -- ``zshalf[9]``, ``cotso[9]``, ``dtdzs[14]`` -- and read its
level table from ``__constant__ real ruc_soil_layer_depth[9]``.  That was the
whole nine-level pin on the forecast column.  The lift compiles the module at
a geometry chosen by the caller, through the same
``woof.core.kernels.get_kernel_int_defines`` loader ``acoustic.cu``'s
``WPHI_MAX_LEV`` ladder uses.

The acceptance that matters is NEGATIVE: every nine-level configuration that
ran before must compile the same translation unit it compiled before.  Four
independent instruments say so here, and every one of them is CPU-only:

1. **The geometry mechanism is inert at nine.**  With snow explicitly at
   ``wrf_45``, :func:`ruc_module_defines` is EMPTY at 9, so the launcher takes
   the unspecialized loader and the string handed to
   NVRTC is byte-identical to ``module_source("ruc")`` -- the exact string the
   pre-ladder launcher produced.  Digested and compared.

2. **The lift is exactly a macro-for-literal substitution, PLUS one named
   fix.**  The shipped source is run BACKWARDS -- the sentinel-delimited
   blocks are removed or restored, and the five macros are replaced by the
   bare literals they expand to at nine -- and the result is hashed against
   :data:`PRE_LIFT_FILE_SHA256`, the digest ``FROZEN_MODULE_DIGESTS['ruc'][0]``
   carried on 29c337754 *before* this lane touched anything.  This test
   authenticates itself against the tree's own record.  If it is red, the lift
   changed something other than a level count and the re-pinned freeze digest
   is no longer justified.

   The "plus one named fix" is the ``RUC_NZS DZSTOP`` block, kept in its own
   sentinel and its own inversion step precisely so that it cannot hide
   inside the substitution.  ``ruc_soil_finalize`` computed ``dzstop = 1 /
   (0.01f - 0.0f)`` -- WRF's NINE-level ``zsmain(2) - zsmain(1)`` written out
   as a literal instead of read from the table -- and the macro sweep walked
   past it because it is a DEPTH, not an extent.  At six levels that divides
   by 0.01 where the geometry is 0.05, and the kernel returned a ground heat
   flux five times too large: measured, before the fix, as grdflx
   -337.1 W m-2 against the host lane's -67.4 on the same column.  It now
   reads ``ruc_soil_layer_depth[1] - [0]`` like every other site in the file.
   At nine those ARE 0.01f and 0.00f, so no number moves --
   ``tests/test_ruc_nzs_device.py`` measures that on the hardware -- but the
   PTX does move, a ``__constant__`` load where an immediate was.  That is
   why the ladder's no-op and identical-PTX claims below are measured
   against a source that already carries the fix, and why the fix has a
   generated-code test of its own.

3. **The generated code is identical**, measured twice on real tools: token
   streams out of a host C preprocessor, and PTX out of ``nvcc -ptx``.  Each
   has a negative control at ``-DRUC_NZS=6`` that must DIFFER, so neither
   comparison passes merely because it cannot fail.

4. **The no-arithmetic rule is mechanized.**  Every macro the ladder defines
   expands to a BARE DECIMAL LITERAL -- ``#define RUC_NZS_M2 7``, never
   ``#define RUC_NZS_M2 (RUC_NZS - 2)``.  The second form is correct
   arithmetic and expands to ``(9 - 2)`` where the pre-lift source had the
   single token ``7``, which is what would make (2) impossible.  Note the
   rule is about the DEFINITIONS: use sites such as ``RUC_NZS - step`` are
   required by the lift and expand to the same ``9 - step`` they always did.

Every test in this file is CPU-only and imports no CuPy -- which is why
:mod:`woof.core.ruc_tier` exists as its own module rather than living in
``woof.core.ruc_gpu``, whose module-scope ``import cupy`` would make this
whole file unimportable on a box with no card.
