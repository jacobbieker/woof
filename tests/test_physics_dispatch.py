"""Selector-VALUE dispatch: no scheme may stand in for another.

The physics driver used to branch on the *truthiness* of
``sf_surface_physics`` and ``bl_pbl_physics``.  Unlocking a selector without
adding a runner would therefore have run Noah under a RUC or Noah-MP request
and YSU under a MYNN request -- plausible numbers, wrong scheme, no error.
These are the negative controls for that, plus the admission seams that must
stay fail-closed until each port lands.

The tests are pure Python and never touch a device: ``woof.core.physics``
imports cupy, but ``_cpu_driver`` rebinds the module's ``cp`` to numpy and
constructs the driver with ``object.__new__``, so no array is ever allocated
on a GPU.
