"""Where five separately-developed lanes touch, and could disagree.

Each lane in the v1.3.1 wave was green on its own branch.  Green on a
branch means "my rules hold"; it does not mean "my rules and yours hold
at the same time", and the three seams below are the ones where two
lanes both have an opinion about the same configuration:

* **combination law x nest edges.**  The nest-edge lane admits all 20
  mixed parent->child microphysics edges.  The combination lane makes
  WRF v4.6.1's own compatibility table the admission authority for each
  domain.  A tree the edge matrix likes is still made of domains, and
  every one of them still has to be a legal WRF suite -- an edge policy
  must not become a way to smuggle a WRF-fatal PBL/surface-layer pairing
  into a nest.

* **projections x wizard.**  The projection lane landed polar
  stereographic and Mercator end to end; the wizard lane added the
  prompt session.  The session never mentions projections, so the only
  thing that can go wrong is silent: the short front door authoring a
  domain whose projection the rest of the pipeline refuses.

* **knobs x combination law.**  Six knobs were wired end to end, and one
  of them (``isfflx``) is consumed by the very surface-layer components
  the compatibility matrix rules on.  A knob must not change a verdict
  the matrix owns, in either direction.
