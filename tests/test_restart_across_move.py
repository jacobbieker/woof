"""Resuming a forecast whose nest moved.

Three things have to be true for this to work at all, and each is cheap
to state and was broken or absent before:

1. the checkpoint has to record WHERE each domain was, because a nest
   that moved is not where its config puts it and every setup array it
   owns belongs to the placement it was at;
2. the checkpoint has to say it crossed a relocation -- that block was
   computed and then dropped on the floor, so every checkpoint written
   after a move claimed ``relocation: null`` and the restore-side
   warning that reads it could never fire;
3. the move chain has to be replayable, so a resume RECONSTRUCTS the
   identity the checkpoint was written under instead of bypassing the
   gate that binds it.

The end-to-end run lives in RESTART-ACROSS-MOVE.md; these are the units
that make it possible.
