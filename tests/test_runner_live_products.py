"""A forecast runner with no host draws every frame as it lands.

The breakage these pin: ``woof go`` runs its forecast runner as a
subprocess and asks it, on its command line, to draw the first frame
early.  That was all it drew while the forecast ran: every later frame,
and every nest's frames, waited for the finalize stage, and a nested
``woof go`` drew nothing at all until the end because the tree runner
was never given the flags.  The run-plan route, which hosts the runner
in its own process, already drew each frame as it landed.

A stand-in renderer writes what the real one writes, so the arming, the
queue and the hand-over to the finalize stage are pinned without a real
render.
