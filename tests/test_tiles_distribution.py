"""Whatever the distribution ships must be able to reach what it imports.

THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR
--------------------------
``woof/core/streaming.py`` shipped in the wheel and ``tilestream/`` did not.
``[tool.setuptools.packages.find]`` read ``include = ["woof*", "tools"]``, so
the built wheel carried the ``[tiles]`` option surface and none of the
transport it calls.  From a clean install::

    mode=off   -> ok (step)
    mode=auto  -> ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tilestream'
    mode=on    -> ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tilestream'

``decide()`` reaches ``_halo_for`` for every mode except ``off``, and
``make_stepper`` calls ``decide`` first, so the headline feature of the lane
could not be reached from the product at all.  ``tools/les1m_probe.py`` ships
too and imports ``tilestream.harness`` the same way.

WHY NOTHING CAUGHT IT
---------------------
Two reasons, and both are the interesting half.

1. Every ``tilestream`` import in ``streaming.py`` is FUNCTION-LOCAL, so
   ``import woof.core.streaming`` succeeds in a distribution that cannot run
   it.  An import-time smoke test proves nothing here.
2. ``tools/battery/tiles_gates.txt`` says to run the gates "FROM THE
   REPOSITORY ROOT", and a repository root on ``sys.path`` makes ``tilestream``
   importable whether or not it is installed.  Every gate was measuring the
   checkout, never the distribution.

So this file asks the packaging declaration itself, and then asks a subprocess
that has no repository root on its path.  Both are cheap -- a handful of AST
walks and one interpreter start -- which is why this belongs on the stage-1
list rather than at a release cut.

EVERY MEASUREMENT IS PAIRED WITH A DECLARATION
----------------------------------------------
The wheel's real contents can only be asked of ``setuptools.find_packages``,
and the documented project virtualenv has no setuptools -- so a file written
only that way SKIPS in the one environment where it is run, and a skipped
packaging gate reads exactly like a passing one.  This file's first version
was inert that way.  Each ``importorskip`` measurement therefore has a
``tomllib`` reading of the same declaration beside it, and a third test holds
the two against each other so the cheap one cannot drift into a false
comfort.  The pattern is ``tests/test_package_data_coverage.py``'s, stated at
``test_the_redistributed_table_is_not_excluded_in_the_pyproject_declaration``.

RELATED
-------
``tests/test_package_data_coverage.py`` asks the neighbouring question, "does
every non-Python file under ``gpuwm/`` ship", and stops its walk at ``gpuwm/``
by design.  This file asks "can every shipped module import what it imports",
which is the question that has to walk the other packages too.
