"""The policy that bounds an analysis and the gate that refuses one agree.

Two contracts decide whether a cycled analysis survives the process boundary,
and they are written in different files.  ``woof.core.health.rule_for_field``
says which fields the pre-leg gate refuses below zero; the tuple
``woof.da.positivity.NON_NEGATIVE_FIELDS`` says which fields the run's
positivity policy has an opinion about.  A field in the first and not in the
second is analysed with nothing bounding it and then refused by the gate one
leg later, in another process, with no clue pointing back here.

That is not hypothetical.  The aerosol-aware tracers ``nwfa``/``nifa`` joined
the health contract before they joined the policy's list, and a real radar
cycle saved a generation whose water-friendly aerosol number reached
-2.96e9 kg^-1 in 4,178 cells.
The policy's own receipt named them "unconstrained" and the driver believed
it.  Both cycles that hit it burned a card for four minutes to find out.

So the driver asks the two contracts whether they agree, before it saves
anything, and refuses by name when they do not.
