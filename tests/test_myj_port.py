"""MYJ PBL (bl_pbl_physics=2) and its Eta surface layer (sf_sfclay=2).

WHAT THIS FILE IS EVIDENCE FOR, stated before the first assertion so nobody
has to infer it from a passing run:

* the float32 CPU authority (``woof/verify/myj_ref.py``) runs both column
  functions on land and water soundings and produces finite, bounded,
  physically ordered output;
* the CUDA translation units agree with that authority within a stated
  tolerance, on the same columns;
* the SHIPPED seams reach the scheme -- ``initialize_physics`` allocates
  MYJ's own fields and ``PhysicsDriver.compute`` dispatches to
  ``_run_myj_sfclay`` and ``_run_myj_pbl`` -- and a forecast advances;
* the pairing law refuses a half-suite in both directions, at load;
* the registry, the namelist importer and the restart identity table all
  name the scheme.

WHAT IT IS **NOT** EVIDENCE FOR.  There is NO ORACLE COMPARISON AGAINST THE
WRF FORTRAN anywhere in this file.  No gfortran replay of
``phys/module_bl_myjpbl.F`` or ``phys/module_sf_myjsfc.F`` has been run,
no fixture of WRF words exists, and no ULP table is asserted.  Everything
below is self-consistency, physical sanity and integration; the number that
would say "this is WRF" has not been measured.  That campaign is the
declared next stage, as it was for Shin-Hong and Grell-Freitas.

Every physical-sanity assertion carries a MUTATION CONTROL, and the
controls are REAL: each one replaces a ported routine inside
``woof.verify.myj_ref`` and re-runs the SAME assertion helper the shipped
test calls, requiring it to go red.  Nothing here asserts on a locally
built stub dictionary -- delete a routine and this file fails.  The
per-routine table (``_ROUTINE_MUTATIONS``) records which bars each stub
breaks, measured on this tree, so a bar that quietly loses its teeth
changes the table rather than passing anyway.  Two coverage holes are
DECLARED there rather than papered over: stubbing ``_vdifq`` breaks
nothing in this file, and neutering the similarity-table lookup leaves
every surface bar green.

    WRF seeds the interface-height column with the terrain height
    (``ZINT(KTE+1)=HT``, module_bl_myjpbl.F:312, module_sf_myjsfc.F:162);
    woof seeds 0 and carries heights above ground
    (``woof/verify/myj_ref.py::_interface_heights``).  HT cancels exactly
    in real arithmetic.  In float32 it does NOT cancel exactly, and the
    docstring's old claim that it did was the thing that needed measuring.

    Measured on this tree, over five columns (four stretched so that no dz
    and no interface height is an exactly representable float32, plus one
    uniform 100 m column) x three terrain heights (1523.7314, 2987.3129 and
    4411.0837 m), land and water:

    * KPBL is IDENTICAL in every case -- no branch decision moves;
    * non-tendency fields differ by at most 69 ULP.  The field that
      attains it is ``lh`` over water, where the move is 1.645e-05
      W m-2;
    * in RELATIVE terms the worst non-tendency move is 5.75e-06, and it
      is attained on ``qfx``, not on ``lh``.  ULP and relative are
      measured separately here because they land on different fields:
      the earlier claim of 9.3e-07 relative was this file's own
      1.645e-05 W m-2 water-case absolute divided by the LAND ``lh``,
      a pairing that measures nothing.  Both numbers below come out of
      the same loop that produces the bounds;
    * tendency rows differ by at most 2.05 quanta, where a quantum is the
      source field's float32 ULP over dt -- the resolution limit of a
      float32 tendency, so this is the smallest difference expressible.

    The bounds below carry headroom over those measurements; the test's job
    is to catch the divergence GROWING, and to fail if a future edit makes
    the column exactly HT-invariant by accident, which would mean it is no
    longer measuring anything.
