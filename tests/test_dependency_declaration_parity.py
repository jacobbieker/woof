"""Every module the wheel imports is declared, and every declaration is used.

Both directions, because the project has been bitten by both.

*Imported but undeclared* is the ``pyshp`` defect: the demo renderer read the
vendored Natural Earth shapefiles with ``import shapefile`` for months while
no table anywhere named ``pyshp``, and it was found the only way it can be
found -- a fresh environment that installed exactly what the quickstart said,
then died on ``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'shapefile'`` after a
whole forecast and every DA cycle had already run.  ``huggingface_hub`` was
the same defect, still open, at the time this file was written.

*Declared but unimported* is the other half of the same inaccurate: a
requirement nobody consumes costs every user download bytes and install time
for nothing, and it makes the table unreadable -- a reviewer cannot tell which
lines are essential.

*In an extra when it should be in the base install* is the third, and it is
the one that actually removes features from users.  ``pip install recast-woof`` must
give a working product; a capability behind an extra that no documented
install line names does not exist.  Before this gate,
``pip install 'recast-woof[all-cu12]'`` -- the README's own recommended line --
shipped without velocity dealiasing, because ``scipy`` sat in an ``[obs]`` and
a ``[dealias]`` extra that appear in no user-facing document.

So the rule this file enforces is not "declare things".  It is:

1. every third-party top-level module the *shipped* code imports resolves to
   a distribution this project declares (:func:`test_every_imported_module_is_declared`);
2. that distribution is in the **base** ``dependencies`` unless the module is
   written down in :data:`_EXTRA_GATED` together with the extra that gates it
   and the reason -- so "put it behind an extra" is a decision someone has to
   record, not a default (:func:`test_extra_gating_is_declared_deliberately`);
3. nothing is declared that nothing imports
   (:func:`test_every_declaration_is_imported`);
4. the built distribution's own ``Requires-Dist`` metadata agrees with the
   table above, so a stale install cannot report green
   (:func:`test_installed_metadata_agrees_with_pyproject`).

The scan is an AST walk, not a text search, so a name inside a string or a
comment cannot satisfy it and a conditional import inside a function cannot
hide from it.

What "shipped" means
--------------------
Exactly what the wheel carries: ``woof`` and every subpackage, plus the
*top level* of ``tools`` -- ``[tool.setuptools.packages.find]`` names
``tools`` and not ``tools*``, so ``tools/ftz_receipt/`` and its siblings are
build-time material that never reaches a user.  :func:`_shipped_sources`
re-derives that from ``pyproject.toml`` rather than hard-coding it, and
:func:`test_the_shipped_surface_matches_the_packaging_declaration` fails if
the include list changes shape underneath it.

Two of the include entries are DATA anchors that carry no import surface --
``configs*`` and ``docs`` -- and both are asserted to keep carrying none, so
neither can grow Python without somebody deciding it should.

``tests/`` is scanned too, but only to justify the ``[dev]`` extra: the test
suite is the only consumer ``pytest`` and ``psutil`` have.

def test_no_shipped_module_imports_a_sibling_by_bare_name(pyproject):
    """``import da_nowcast`` must not be the ONLY way a module finds a sibling.

    Inside the wheel these are ``tools.da_nowcast`` and friends.  A bare
    top-level import of one resolves when the module is run as a path from a
    checkout; whether it resolves from an installed wheel depends entirely on
    whether something put the sibling's directory on ``sys.path`` first.

    Measured, on a wheel installed into a clean venv with no checkout
    anywhere on the path: every one of the recorded sites below DOES resolve,
    because ``tools`` ships as a flat top-level package and every hack points
    at ``<site-packages>/tools``, which exists.  So this is not a live
    breakage on this base -- the 2.3.2 audit filed it as latent and the
    measurement agrees.

    It is still worth a gate, for the reason the hacks are fragile rather
    than wrong: each one puts 142 top-level module names at ``sys.path[0]``,
    ahead of the standard library and every installed distribution, for the
    lifetime of the process in the two cases that never pop it.  Nothing
    under ``tools/`` collides today (checked: no stdlib name, no common
    distribution name), and the day one does, the failure is a shadowed
    import in an unrelated library.

    So the two permitted shapes are: a package-qualified import, with the
    bare name only as a ``python tools/x.py`` fallback; or a recorded entry
    in :data:`_SYS_PATH_SIBLING_SITES` saying which file does it and why
    nobody has package-qualified it yet.
