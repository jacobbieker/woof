"""Pinned SASE dynamic-solve goldens shared by the CPU and GPU suites.

S3-3 review fold-in: the FP64 authority goldens for the frozen seed-3
varying-e real-lift fixture (``test_dynamic_solve_real_lift_golden_values``
in ``test_sase.py`` and the device golden gate in ``test_sase_gpu.py``)
used to live as duplicated literals in the two files; one ``GOLDEN_*``
constants block means a deliberate re-pin edits exactly one site and the
suites can never drift apart.  They deliberately do NOT live in
``woof/verify/sase_ref.py``: the authority module is frozen and pinned
evidence about it belongs with the tests.

The FP64 pair freezes the authority's six-row layout, the off-diagonal
weight-1 convention, the cond threshold, and the clip/recovery order.
The DEVICE pair is the measured FP32 result of the same fixture
(deterministic block reduction + host np sum), and it is a property of
the card as well as of the code: ``GOLDEN_DEVICE_BY_CARD`` holds one pair
per card, keyed by the device name cupy reports, and the device golden
gate in ``test_sase_gpu.py`` skips with the reason on a card with no
pair rather than failing for the card and not the code.  Any toolchain
change that shifts a card's digits must arrive as a deliberate re-pin,
mirroring the CPU golden-pin policy.

READING, 2026-09-18, a development machine's RTX 4090 (compute capability 8.9, driver
610.57.04, CUDA runtime 13020, cupy 14.2.0, NVRTC 13.3.33): the 5090 pair
below fails the rtol 1e-9 gate there in ``f`` by rel 1.481e-08 (abs
1.381e-08) while ``c_nu`` holds at rel 4.844e-10; the 4090's own pair,
identical across two processes and across the test's second in-process
call, is rel 1.845e-07 (c_nu) and 1.039e-08 (f) from the FP64 authority,

# S3-6b split-step trajectory goldens: the S3-6c device-mirror parity
# targets.  Two-step FP64 ``sase_split_step`` trajectories on the frozen
# seed-20260720 band-limited fixture (see
# ``test_split_step_trajectory_goldens`` for the exact construction):
# BOX = uniform clamped dz=200 m, dt=0.5; COL = model mode on the
# geometric 1.08 thickness column from 50 m, dt=0.05.  Field sums are
# FP64 ``np.sum`` (deterministic pairwise order); C_NU/F are the
# step-2 ledger values.  S3-6c gates the fused device split step
# against the same fixture and inherits these literals.
#
# RE-PINNED for S3-6d (analytic dissipation substep): replacing the
# explicit forward-Euler dissipation e - dt*C_E*e^{3/2}/l_d with the
# exact decay e*/(1 + b*dt)^2 shifts each step's e by O((b*dt)^2 * e)
# -- the Euler-vs-exact Taylor gap, O(dt^2) per step -- and the step-2
# solve/momentum channels inherit it through e^n.  Measured deliberate
# shift vs the S3-6b pins: BOX e 3.8e-6 rel (u/v/w < 1e-15 -- momentum
# feels e only through the step-2 stress); COL e 2.5e-7, u/v/w
# <= 1.3e-11; F 6.4e-6 (BOX) / 8.5e-8 (COL).  Same fixture, same
# construction, arithmetic change registered in the S3-6d adjudication.
#
# RE-PINNED for S3-6e (RANS-limit horizontal governor): the (1-f)
# horizontal branch becomes the audited 2-D Smagorinsky deformation
# diffusivity (authority ``governed_stress``) and its production share
# bypasses e to heat, so on this fixture (c_nu = 0, f ~ 0.945: the
# (1-f) branch IS the live horizontal channel) the e trajectory and,
# through e^n, the step-2 solve shift deliberately.  Measured shift vs
# the S3-6d pins: BOX e 1.03e-5 rel, u/v/w <= 1.3e-15, F 1.8e-6; COL
# e 1.03e-6, u/v/w <= 1.5e-11, F 1.5e-6.  Same fixture, same
# construction; formulation change registered in the S3-6e
# adjudication (smoke-gate G2, ledger 2026-07-20).  The taper does not
# touch these goldens (no zdamp on the fixture).
#
# RE-PINNED for S3-6f (partition cap + w-based resolved-fraction
# bound): the step's f is now min(f_solved, f_cap(delta/z_i), f_w) and
# the pinned F is the value the step USED.  On this fixture the
# w-based bound BINDS (band-limited w against e ~ 0.05: f_w ~ 0.295 <
# f_solved ~ 0.945 -- the fixture's horizontal-velocity variance had
# been rated "resolved" while its w variance supports far less, which
# is exactly the S3-6f concession); the COL mode's shallow stretched
# column additionally engages the cap (z_i ~ 194 m, delta = 500 m ->
# f_cap ~ 0.54, still above the binding f_w).  Measured shift vs the
# S3-6e pins: BOX e 2.9e-4 rel, u/v/w <= 1e-15; COL e 3.7e-5, u/v/w
# <= 3e-12 (c_nu = 0 on this fixture, so momentum feels f only
# through the (1-f)*K_smag weight).  Same fixture, same construction;
# formulation change registered in the S3-6f adjudication (mesoscale
# sensing concession, ledger 2026-07-20).
#
# RE-PINNED for S3-6g (regime-consistent Prandtl number): the split
# step's buoyancy K_h becomes K_v/Pr_t(f) with Pr_t(f) = f*PR_LES +
# (1-f)*PR_RANS at the step's used f (~0.295 here), so Pr_t ~ 0.70
# replaces the retired fixed 1/3 -- the buoyancy channel WEAKENS ~2.1x
# on this live-theta fixture and the e trajectory (and, through e^n
# and the theta-gradient coupling, the step-2 solve) shifts
# deliberately.  Measured shift vs the S3-6f pins: BOX e 2.34e-3 rel,
# F 1.0e-3, u/v/w <= 8e-16 (momentum feels Pr not at all in step 1 --
# the shift enters only through step-2 e^n); COL e 4.3e-4, F 1.6e-4,
# u/v/w <= 4e-8.  Same fixture, same construction; formulation change
# registered in the S3-6g adjudication (smoke-c PR_T diagnosis,
# ledger 2026-07-20 ~23:0x).  C_MOM_BG (the renamed momentum
# background) is bit-identical to the former C_K/PR_T, contributing
# ZERO shift -- the whole delta is the buoyancy Prandtl blend.
#
# RE-PINNED for S3-6h (BL89 displacement lengths in the RANS limb):
# the vertical channel becomes l_v = f*min(l_B, l_s) +
# (1-f)*min(l_B, l_s, l_mix_BL89) and the l_d blend's RANS limb
# min(l_B, l_eps_BL89) (authority bl89_rans_lengths) -- on this
# live-theta fixture (f ~ 0.294, mixed-sign n2, e ~ 0.05-0.15) the
# BL89 bounds bind in a subset of cells, shifting K_v/l_d there and,
# through e^n, the step-2 solve.  Measured shift vs the S3-6g pins:
# BOX e 2.97e-3 rel, F 1.0e-3, u BITWISE-unchanged and v/w <= 4e-16
# (the RANS-side channel touches momentum only through the implicit
# K_v solve at step 1's unchanged e^n -- the step-1 K_v shift is
# sub-ulp on these sums -- and through step-2 e^n in the stress);
# COL e 5.1e-4, F 1.4e-4, u/v/w <= 1.1e-5 (the stretched column's
# shallow geometry engages the BL89 bounds harder at step 1).  Same
# fixture, same construction; formulation change registered in the
# S3-6h adjudication (jet-coupling diagnosis, ratified option 2,
# ledger 2026-07-21 ~01:0x).  The f = 1 LES limb is pinned bitwise
# elsewhere (test_split_step_les_limb_f1_bitwise_under_bl89): these
# RANS-side shifts are the expected and registered signature.
#
# RE-PINNED for S3-6j (surface momentum stress in the vertical solve)
# -- THE MISSING-FRICTION FIX, and its ONE INTENTIONAL CROSS-LIMB
# CHANGE (the drag applies at ALL f; flagged prominently per the
# S3-6j adjudication): the golden fixture now passes a uniform
# ust = 0.3 m/s field (constructed with np.full AFTER the rng draws --
# the frozen seed-20260720 field sequence is untouched), so the u/v
# Thomas solves carry the implicit surface-stress bottom row
# c = ust^2/max(|V1^n|, SFC_WSPD_FLOOR) folded into diag_0 (authority
# module docstring, S3-6j section; the YSU npref.py:6495-6497
# linearization).  Momentum SHIFTS BY DESIGN -- that is the entire
# point of the amendment: measured shift vs the S3-6i pins BOX
# u 1.56e-3, v 7.66e-4 rel (the drag decelerating the bottom row),
# w 8.0e-16 and e 7.7e-8 (step-2 trajectory coupling through P_v and
# the stress at the shifted e^n), F 1.8e-8; COL u 6.23e-4, v 3.06e-4,
# w 3.4e-13, e 2.1e-8, F 4.8e-9.  The BOX split-ledger residual with
# drag engaged closes to 4.4e-15 of scale under the restated
# BOUNDARY-CONSISTENT closure dKE + dE + dHeat - dKE_sfc (measured
# dKE_sfc = -1.58e-2, dE_sfc_src = +8.64e-2, sfc_conv_resid diagnosed
# open).  Same seeds, same construction otherwise; formulation change
# registered in the S3-6j adjudication (Probe-4 whole-column-
# acceleration falsification, ledger 2026-07-21).  ust=None remains
# bitwise the S3-6i step (pinned by the f = 1 LES-limb test's
# no-drag leg).
#
# RE-PINNED for S3-6i (decoupled stable-limit diffusivity coefficient
# C_KS): the vertical channel's RANS limb becomes
# C_r*l_mix_rans*sqrt(e) with C_r = C_KV + (C_KS/LS_COEF - C_KV)*
# rho^2, rho = min(l_mix_rans/l_s, 1) (authority
# stable_limit_coefficient), and the l_v length blend is restated as
# the equivalent two-product K_v blend (RANS-only coefficient change;
# f = 1 FP-exact as before).  On this fixture (f ~ 0.294, mixed-sign
# n2) the stable cells' K_v drops toward C_KS*e/N where l_s binds, so
# the e trajectory and, through e^n, the step-2 solve shift
# deliberately; the neutral-cell K-blend restatement contributes only
# roundoff-scale association noise.  Measured shift vs the S3-6h
# pins: BOX e 8.68e-4 rel, F 3.56e-4, u/v/w <= 1.3e-15 (association
# roundoff only -- momentum feels the coefficient through the step-1
# implicit solve, sub-ulp on these sums); COL e 2.44e-4, F 1.09e-4,
# u/v/w <= 5.1e-6 (the shallow stretched column engages the stable
# cells harder at step 1).  Same fixture, same construction;
# formulation change registered in the S3-6i adjudication
# (stable-limit coefficient decoupling, ledger 2026-07-21 ~01:5x);
# C_KS = 0.25 calibrated at the promoted jet-decoupling fixture.
#
# RE-PINNED for S3-9c (GUSTINESS-CORRECTED surface drag; the
# S3-6h/6i/6j adversarial review IMPORTANT-1, task S3-9c): the drag
# conductance gains the audited YSU factor (spd1/max(wspd, 1e-9))^2
# (authority module docstring, S3-9c section; npref.py:6495-6496),
# and the golden fixture now ALSO passes the gust-enhanced speed
# field wspd = max(sqrt(u1^2 + v1^2 + SPLIT_GOLDEN_GUST^2),
# SFC_WSPD_FLOOR) built from the frozen INITIAL level-1 winds
# (constructed AFTER the rng draws beside ust -- the S3-6j idiom --
# and held fixed across both steps exactly like ust; the driver
# refreshes both from sfclay each due step, the fixture freezes
# both).  SPLIT_GOLDEN_GUST = 0.5 m/s is comparable to the
# band-limited resolved speeds, so the factor lands mostly in
# (0.05, 0.95) and the fixture's sub-floor columns (|V1| <
# SFC_WSPD_FLOOR) exercise the calm-gusty branch (factor
# (0.1/wspd)^2 ~ 0.04 -- the over-damping class the correction
# removes).  Momentum shifts BY DESIGN through the weakened drag
# row: measured shift vs the S3-9 pins BOX u 1.19e-3, v 5.86e-4 rel
# (drag work dKE_sfc -1.583e-2 -> -5.054e-3, the correction backing
# the drag off ~3.1x on this gusty fixture), w 4.0e-16 and
# e 5.08e-8 (step-2 coupling through the solved winds), F 1.2e-8;
# COL u 4.75e-4, v 2.34e-4, w 2.3e-13, e 1.35e-8, F 3.2e-9
# (dKE_sfc -6.340e-3 -> -2.023e-3).  The wspd_sfc=None limb is
# BITWISE the S3-9 step (measured drift exactly 0.0 on both modes --
# the no-gustiness identity; the identity pin test asserts the
# supplied-no-gust case bitwise too).  Same seeds, same construction
# otherwise; tolerances untouched; formulation change registered in
# the S3-9c task (adversarial review fix; report
# .superpowers/sdd/task-s3-9c-report.md).
#
# RE-PINNED for S3-9 (geometric dissipation-length blend; F-Y1 Lake
# Michigan over-coupling): the l_d regime blend of the authority's
# ``dissipation_length`` becomes delta**f * l_eps_rans**(1-f) (was the
# linear f*delta + (1-f)*l_eps_rans; authority module docstring, S3-9
# section).  DERIVATION OF THE SHIFT: this fixture runs at INTERIOR
# f ~ 0.294 in both modes, so the pinned trajectories ride the blend
# between its endpoints -- the linear form floored l_d at f*delta =
# 147 m regardless of the RANS composition, while the geometric form
# stays within (delta/l_eps_rans)**f of it (e.g. l_eps_rans ~ 32 m at
# z ~ 100 m gives l_d ~ 71 m vs the linear 169 m), so dissipation
# STRENGTHENS, e falls, and through e^n the step-2 solve and stress
# shift with it; f rises slightly because the lower e_mean tightens
# the w-sensor bound f_w = 1 - e/(e + E_r_w).  Measured shift vs the
# S3-6j pins: BOX e 7.57e-4 rel, F 2.68e-4, u 3.7e-11, v 2.2e-11,
# w 4e-16; COL e 1.81e-4, F 6.4e-5, u/v/w <= 1.2e-9 (momentum feels
# l_d only through the step-2 stress/implicit solve at the shifted
# e^n).  Same seeds, same construction; formulation change registered
# in the S3-9 adjudication (.superpowers/sdd/yolo-lake-mechanism.md,
# controller ledger 2026-07-21).  The f = 0 and f = 1 endpoint
# arithmetic is BITWISE unchanged (pinned by
# test_dissipation_length_blend_les_and_rans_limits and every f = 1
# reduction test); the DEVICE mirror re-pins in S3-9b -- until then
# the GPU parity gates mismatch these literals BY DESIGN.
