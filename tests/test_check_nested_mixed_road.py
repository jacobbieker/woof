"""``woof check`` prices the road the run door actually takes on a tree.

THE DEFECT, reproduced on the published 2.5.8 and 2.6.0 wheels and again
on this line's pre-merge tip.  On a NESTED tree with ``[tiles]``, ``check``
priced only the fully-resident tree and refused it, while the run door's
own per-domain walk (:func:`woof.core.streaming.steppers_for_tree`) took a
MIXED road -- child streamed, parent resident -- that fits the same card
and completes.  Measured on the tree below at ``--budget-gib 13``: the
report said "the forecast is the memory-binding phase at 17.76 GiB peak
envelope; that EXCEEDS the 15.87 GiB budget by 1.89 GiB", failed
``alloc_estimate_le_wddm_budget`` and exited 1 -- beside an advisory that
admitted in the same breath that "a refusal or a fit below describes the
resident tree, not the mixed-road one the run will take".

A report whose own advisory says it priced a run nobody asked for, and
whose exit code refuses that run anyway, teaches the reader that streaming
has no point.  The same walk now prices the report: 15.04 GiB against the
15.87 GiB budget, exit 0, with the per-domain plan printed.

THE CONTROL IS THE OTHER HALF.  A tree that fits NO road still refuses --
the fix is a different question being asked, not a gate being loosened.
