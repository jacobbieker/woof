"""``woof fetch-bridges``: stage the prebuilt Rust artifacts.

A PLATFORM wheel now ships the compiled Rust itself: the artifacts below
are staged into ``woof/libexec/bridges`` by
``tools/stage_wheel_bridges.py`` before the wheel is built, so on a
platform a bundle exists for, ``pip install recast-woof`` is already complete
and this command has nothing left to do.

It remains the route for everyone else: the ``py3-none-any`` fallback
wheel, which pip resolves wherever no platform bundle is published,
carries no binaries at all.  Before either existed, the only way to get
the GRIB decoders, the CPU preprocessing library, the fetch backbone,
the batch renderer, the two radar front doors, the MRMS, Stage-IV,
surface, GOES and European-composite front doors, the NetCDF decoder,
the mapped decode engine, the Zarr reader, the observation remap, the
isobaric-height reader, the energy site sampler, the ML dataset exporter, the
simulated radar and the terminal workspace onto a
wheel install was to clone the repository and run ``cargo build`` -- a
Rust toolchain, a 2.5 GB checkout and a few minutes of compiling, for
forty-three files.
``woof fetch-bridges`` is the same trade :mod:`woof.table_assets`
already makes for the externalized physics tables: the artifacts are
published as versioned GitHub release assets, their exact size and
SHA-256 pins are packaged inside the wheel at release time, and every
byte is verified against those pins *before* anything is installed.

What is staged, and where
-------------------------
One bundle per platform, holding the forty-three artifacts of
:data:`BUNDLED_ARTIFACTS`, staged into :func:`woof.bridges
.default_bridge_dir` (``~/.woof/bridges/<release>-<bundle digest>``)
-- the staged rung of the resolution ladder every consumer already
searches, so nothing else in woof needs to know this command exists.
The directory is this release's alone: until 2.8.6 every release
staged flat into the shared ``~/.woof/bridges``, so two installs of
different versions on one machine re-fetched over each other and each
broke the other's runs.  The flat directory is still read, by the
rung after the versioned one, but only for a file whose bytes are this
release's pin, and it is never written by a pinned install.  ``--dest DIR`` stages
somewhere else; the per-artifact environment variables keep overriding
everything, and a set override is reported rather than silently
shadowed.

A bundle also carries the renderer's map assets -- the Natural Earth
and US Census shapefiles ``rw_wrfbatch`` draws coastlines, borders,
state lines and counties from -- under :data:`ASSET_ROOT`, staged
beside the binaries as ``<dest>/assets/basemap/...``.  That is not a
new lookup: ``rw_wrfbatch`` already resolves ``assets/basemap`` under
its own ancestors, so a renderer staged at ``~/.woof/bridges`` finds
the shapefiles itself, with no environment variable set and no Python
in the loop.  They are not in the ``woof`` wheel because the wheel
has no room, and that is measured rather than estimated: as of
2026-08-17 the platform wheels were 108.70 MB (win_amd64) and 111.70 MB
(manylinux_2_28_x86_64) against PyPI's 100 MB per-file cap, already
over it before a byte of basemap, which deflates to 21.1 MB; see
``tools/stage_wheel_bridges.py``'s docstring for the full table.  So a
wheel install gets them from the ``recast-woof-data`` companion instead, which
every install pulls, and :func:`woof.rustwx.renderer_env` hands that
copy to the wheel's renderer.  Until 2.8.0 this command was their only
route onto a wheel install, no install text ran it, and every picture
of such an install was drawn with no coastlines, borders or state
lines.  The bundle still carries them for the renderer it stages here.

Platform support is a capability check on the OS and machine
architecture -- can this box run the bytes in that bundle -- and never
an identity gate.  A platform with no published bundle is told so by
name and handed the build-from-source route, which remains the
universal one.

The staging contract
--------------------
Every artifact is verified three ways before it is installed: the exact
byte count, the SHA-256 pin packaged with this release, and (for the
decoders that declare one) the contract marker
:data:`woof.bridges.BRIDGE_ABI_MARKERS` -- the same static check
``woof doctor`` applies to a binary already on disk.  A staged file
that fails any of the three is deleted and refused, never installed.
Extraction reads members by their exact pinned filename, so an archive
cannot place a byte anywhere the pins did not name.

Where this deliberately differs from ``fetch-tables``: an existing file
whose bytes do not match the pin is *replaced* here rather than
refused.  A physics table is a fixed asset, so a wrong one on disk is
the operator's to explain; a bridge executable is a versioned build,
and yesterday's copy sitting in ``~/.woof/bridges`` after a Python-half
upgrade is exactly the skew that made 1.1.0 preparations fail with a
message blaming the file woof had just written correctly.  Replacing
it is the point of the command.  The replacement is still gated on the
new bytes passing all three checks first.

Offline and mirrors
-------------------
``--from DIR`` stages from a local directory under identical
verification: either the bundle archive itself, or the declared
artifacts loose in that directory (what an air-gapped operator has
after building them on a machine that does have a toolchain).
``WOOF_BRIDGE_ASSET_URL_BASE`` overrides the download base URL; the
bundle filename is appended to it either way.

Pins are generated at release time
----------------------------------
The bundles are built by the release workflow from the same commit as
the wheel, and ``tools/build_bridge_bundle.py`` computes the pins from
those exact bytes and writes them into :data:`PINS_RESOURCE` before the
wheel is built.  A tree that has not been through that step carries a
pins document declaring no platforms, and this command says so and
refuses rather than inventing a hash to check against.

#: ``rw_odim`` joined for the reason ``rw_nexrad`` did, one continent
#: over.  European polar-volume ingest had a complete library path, a
#: ``woof obs radar`` front door, and no way to obtain the binary that
#: path drives without a Rust toolchain and a source checkout -- which by
#: this project's rule means it was not shipped: a capability the engine
#: has and the user cannot reach does not exist.  It builds ``--locked
#: --offline`` from the same vendored closure on the same two platforms
#: as its siblings and carries the same source-revision stamp, so
#: bundling it costs an entry here and nothing else.
#:
#: ``rw_opera`` was the one door still left out when these two lanes were
#: written apart, and for a reason that stopped being true when they were
#: put together: ``crates/rw-obs`` carried no ``build.rs`` and none of its
#: entry points embedded the source-revision stamp, so a cut could not
#: prove the binary it staged.  The observation-front-door lane added that
#: ``build.rs`` and stamped three of the crate's four entry points; the
#: fourth, ``opera.rs``, did not exist on that lane.  Stamping it here is
#: the whole remaining cost, so the composite ships with its siblings
#: rather than waiting for a lane of its own.
#:
#: ``rw_nexrad`` joined this list once it was clear that leaving it out
#: made ``woof doctor`` pass on boxes that could not ingest a single
#: radar observation: it is the only route into the radar-DA nowcast,
#: it has no fallback the way the fetch backbone and the renderer do,
#: and it builds ``--locked --offline`` out of the same vendored
#: closure on the same two platforms as its two workspace siblings.
#: The alternative -- telling every user to install a Rust toolchain --
#: is the one prerequisite this project otherwise never imposes.
#:
#: ``rw_mrms``, ``rw_stage4``, ``rw_asos`` and ``rw_goes`` joined for
#: the same reason, one wave later and one wave too late.  All four were
#: written, tested and committed; all four are resolved out of
#: ``~/.woof/bridges`` by :mod:`woof.obs.frontdoor`; and none of them
#: was in this tuple, so ``woof fetch-bridges`` -- the command their
#: own refusals named -- staged a complete bundle and the refusal
#: repeated verbatim.  That is the ``rw_mpas_convert`` failure exactly:
#: committed is not shipped, and a refusal naming a command that cannot
#: help is worse than no message.  A front door that a resolver looks
#: for and a refusal names belongs in the bundle that resolver reads.
#: The release workspace already BUILT them -- ``cargo build --release
#: --locked`` at ``tools/rustwx`` builds every workspace member -- so
#: the four binaries were produced by the cut, probed by nothing, and

    which of the two routes below is theirs.

    A checkout is never told to ``pip install`` over itself: its
