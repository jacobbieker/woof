"""``woof doctor``: verify the runtime estate, print exact remedies.

The pip package deliberately splits its runtime across estates the
installer cannot see from ``pip install`` alone: the GPU runtime
(CuPy), the optional pip extras (``render``, ``obs``, ``dealias`` and
whatever else the installed distribution declares), the compiled Rust
artifacts (never shipped in the wheel; ``woof fetch-bridges`` stages a
release's prebuilt bundle where one exists for the platform), the
packaged physics tables, and the data roots
(``WPS_GEOG``/``GPUWM_CASE_DATA_ROOT``).  Doctor checks each one for
real, not by presence: it imports every declared package in short-lived
subprocesses, probe-executes every bridge and front-door executable,
loads the CPU preprocessing library through ctypes and reads its ABI
version, sha256-validates the packaged Thompson tables with the same
routine the model uses at launch, parses the Noah/landuse tables with
the model's own parsers, re-hashes every artifact a sealed manifest
declares, resolves each data route's decoder and byte transport through
the resolvers the route itself calls, and requires each WPS_GEOG
dataset's ``index`` file.  No cargo builds, no network; the device work
is three deliberate short-lived subprocess probes (the CuPy-wheel/box
cuBLAS pairing, a cold-cache NVRTC compile, and the radar-DA
eigensolver), isolated so a wedged runtime cannot poison this process.
Every gap prints a remedy whose every line is either a command that
runs as printed in this platform's own shell or a ``#`` comment --
never prose fused onto a command -- instead of letting the user meet a
raw traceback three commands later.

**The extras are read from the INSTALLED distribution's metadata**, not
from a checkout's ``pyproject.toml``.  What a box can do is decided by
what pip resolved onto it, and a checkout sitting beside a wheel is
exactly the configuration where a transcription and the truth part
company.

Statuses distinguish what was proven: ``verified`` means the deep check
ran and passed; ``present`` is for the few items where nothing deeper
than existence can accurately be checked, plus the one deep check that
can half-pass and says which half (the radar-DA eigensolver);
``untested`` is for a question this module deliberately does not answer
-- it never runs cargo, so it cannot say whether a build would succeed
-- and its detail always opens with "not tested"; ``missing`` is a gap
with a remedy; ``info`` is context.  ``verified`` is never printed over
a question nobody asked: two binaries once carried ``ok`` on a box
where the command that needed them could not find them, and that is
what ``untested`` exists to stop.

The report is layered (:mod:`woof.explain`).  By default every finding
is one line -- status, subject, and THE command that closes it -- and
adjacent findings that share a remedy fold into one, because a fresh pip
install gaps every Rust artifact at once and six identical remedies read
as six problems.  ``--explain`` prints what this module always printed:
the evidence behind each check and the whole pasteable remedy block,
verbatim.  Nothing was shortened; the long form moved one flag away.

Exit status: 1 when any finding is ``broken`` or ``unreachable``, 0
otherwise.  A ``degraded`` or ``opt-in`` finding still prints MISSING
and still prints its command; it does not fail the process.  The rule
that assigns those four words is stated once, in :func:`blocking_gaps`.

    ``cupy.arange().sum()`` reduction ALL fail with "Failed to find CUDA
    headers", and ``pip install 'cupy-cuda13x[ctk]'`` gives an 1867 MiB
    environment in which all three pass.  CuPy publishes the toolkit as
    an extra of its own wheel, pinned to that wheel's CUDA major, so the
    fix is one line, needs no conda, no administrator and no
    ``CUDA_PATH``.  The old lead -- a conda toolkit -- assumed an estate
    the failing box did not have.

    CuPy's own message hardcodes ``cupy-cuda12x[ctk]`` at every major.
    Pasted on a CUDA-13 box that installs the wheel that cannot load
    cuBLAS there, which is the trap this whole module was rewritten

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Doctor probed cupy, wrf and matplotlib and NOTHING ELSE on the Python
# side.  A 2026-08-14 reachability audit ran `woof doctor --explain` on
# a bare install and measured the consequence: 40,351 characters of
# report in which the strings `scipy`, `pyshp`, `shapefile`, `rasterio`
# and `pyproj` appeared ZERO times.  Four extras -- `obs`, `dealias`,
# `geog`, and half of `render` -- were invisible to the one command
# whose whole job is telling a user what their install cannot do.  The
# same report called `[render]` "wrf-rust + matplotlib" while the extra
# is wrf-rust + pyshp and matplotlib is a BASE dependency, so the one
# line a reader could have followed to the shapefile reader said the
# wrong package.
#
# The enumeration below is therefore NOT a transcription of
# pyproject.toml.  It is read from the installed distribution's own
# metadata, because that is what pip resolved onto this box, and a
# checkout sitting beside a wheel is exactly the configuration where a
# transcription and the truth part company.  What this module still

# command each extra is the difference between running and not.

    Doctor's whole job is to answer that before anything is run.

    What the row reports moved when the warp substrate flipped onto the

    the shipped configuration does not read.  It becomes a real problem

    diagnostic, exits with an orderly code -- separates a runnable

    refuses to launch (OSError) or dies with an abnormal status
    (Windows NTSTATUS / signal) and no diagnostic of its own.

    The header is checked BEFORE anything is launched, because on
    Windows the expensive way of asking this question can never answer:
    ``subprocess.run``'s timeout bounds the wait and not
    ``CreateProcess``, and a file with a corrupt image header can raise
    a modal loader dialog inside that call which no timeout reaches.
    Two release batteries froze there, on a file containing sixteen
    ASCII characters.  :func:`woof.bridges.launchable` answers the same
    question from the bytes; the launch that follows is bounded by the

    THIS IS THE ``ok`` THIS MODULE WAS CAUGHT PRINTING, and it is now the

    staged ``grib2_inventory`` and ``grib2_dump``, ``_bridge_checks``
    probe-executed both and printed ``ok bridge grib2_inventory``, and
    then::

              --input FILE.grib2
        NotADirectoryError: [WinError 267] The directory name is invalid

    Both of doctor's statements about the FILES were true.  Neither was a
    statement about the ROUTE, and the route is what the reader was
    asking about: ``mapped_source._build_grib2_tools()`` never consulted
    the staged copies, it shelled ``cargo build`` in ``<package
    parent>/tools/grib1_bridge``, a directory no wheel contains.

    That function consults :func:`woof.bridges.find_bridge` FIRST now,
    the way ``ingest/grib.py`` always did, so the staged copies ARE what
    the default route uses.  And it is the resolver of RECORD: the
    ``rw-wps``/``woof prep`` front door resolves the same two tools
    through the same function for every GRIB2 route it dispatches --
    mapped, 20CRv3, and each packaged-profile source -- so a bare
    ``woof prep --source hrrr-prs`` needs no tool flags on a box this
    line calls verified.  The check applies the resolver's own static
    contract gate too, because "resolves" that hands the route a stale
    decoder is the same green-over-a-hole one release later.  This
    check still answers the route's question rather than the file's --
    it just has a third answer it did not have before:

    * both tools resolve through the ladder, and then the default route
      reaches them.  ``verified``.  This is the state a wheel install
      lands in after ``woof fetch-bridges``, and reporting it as a gap
      would be the same defect in the opposite direction.
    * neither resolves, and a crate is present (a source checkout), and
      then doctor CANNOT answer: judging the build would mean running
      cargo, which this module never does.  ``untested``, and it says so.
    * neither resolves and there is no crate to build in.  ``missing``,
      and the remedy is ``woof fetch-bridges`` with nothing appended to
      it, because staging is now sufficient on its own.

    It does not block.  See :func:`blocking_gaps`: the doors it closes
    (``woof-mapped-inspect``, ``woof adapt --descriptor``, the 20CRv3
    direct route) live in the CLI reference and the examples, not in the
    README's or FIRST-LIGHT's own first-run path.

    """Are the artifacts this box RESOLVES the bytes this release pinned?

    Every other artifact line in this report asks a question of one
    binary: is it there, does it launch, does it declare this contract.
    a development machine answered yes to all three on an estate staged in August by an
    earlier release -- the files were present, they launched, and
    :data:`woof.bridges.BRIDGE_ABI_MARKERS` only moves when a contract
    version bumps, which it had not -- so ``woof doctor`` printed no
    gaps and exited 0, and the first ``woof prep`` refused with rc 78.

    The question this check asks is the one ``woof fetch-bridges``
    asks and doctor did not: are these the exact bytes -- size and
    SHA-256 -- that the release this wheel came from published?  It is
    asked of the file each consumer's own resolution ladder would pick
    (:func:`woof.bridges.find_artifact`), not of a directory listing,
    because what a route runs is what the ladder returns.

    Three verdicts, and the difference between them is who owns the
    bytes:

    * A mismatch on a file under :func:`woof.bridges.default_bridge_dir`
      is a gap.  That directory is exactly what ``woof fetch-bridges``
      writes, so one command closes it.
    * A mismatch on a file resolved anywhere else -- an environment
      override, a checkout's ``target/release`` -- is reported and does
      NOT block.  A cargo build never matches a release pin, and
      offering to re-fetch a directory that binary does not live in
      would name a breakage that is not there.
    * Absent is somebody else's line.  Every bundled artifact already
      has a check that names it when it is not staged, and printing the
      same gap twice gives a reader two counts of one estate.

    The doors ask the same question now, at the moment they pick a file
    (:func:`woof.bridges.require_release_pin`, over the same pins and
    the same size-and-SHA-256 comparison), which is what this line used
    to say alone: a development machine's report named the skew and every route went on
    running the August bytes anyway.  This check keeps its own job --
    saying what the estate IS, all of it, before anything opens a door
    -- and stays a reader: it resolves inside
    :func:`woof.bridges.inspection_only` so measuring the box never
    repairs it.

    A bundled binary with **no fallback**.  A missing fetch backbone
    leaves the Python transport, so that one is ``info``; there is no
    second way to turn a radar volume into observations, so an absent
    ``rw_nexrad`` is the difference between a box that can assimilate
    and a box that cannot.  (It is not the ONLY such binary, which this
    docstring used to claim: ``region_global_dealias`` has no fallback
    either -- ``vad-region`` is a different solver, not a substitute --
    and the renderer's "matplotlib fallback" turned out to need the
    ``[render]`` extra as well.  Both were measured, 2026-08-14.)
    It is reported ``missing`` and it blocks, for the same reason the
    GRIB bridges do: it ships in the bundle ``woof fetch-bridges``
    stages, so its absence means an incomplete install rather than an
    unexercised option.

    This check exists because the report used to pass without it.
    ``rw_nexrad`` was outside both audited sets -- not a GRIB bridge,
    not a render engine -- so ``woof doctor`` printed a clean estate on
    installs where every radar route was dead, and the first news came
    from the launcher refusing to print a plan.

    Staleness is judged, not just presence.  The wrapper pins the exact
    ``--abi`` contract line it was written against, so a binary built
    before the live-chunk route fails the probe here rather than at the
    first live fetch -- and the remedy for that one is *rebuild*, never
    re-point, which is why the stale branch says so in those words.

    Metadata, not presence: a companion cut for another release has
    every file and opens cleanly.  It is a different numerical setup
    wearing the right filenames -- 2.6.1's radiation and microphysics
    reading 2.6.0's k-distribution and lookup tables -- and it produces
    numbers rather than an error, which is why nothing downstream can
    see it and why it belongs in this report.

    A finding is one of four severities, and exactly two of them fail
    the process:

    ``broken`` (blocks)
        Something is present and wrong: a truncated executable, a table
        that fails its hash, a manifest artifact that fails
        revalidation, an installed package that will not import, a CuPy
        wheel whose cuBLAS will not load on this box.  Nobody chose
        this, and nothing downstream can work around it.

    ``unreachable`` (blocks)
        A command the product's own README or FIRST-LIGHT tells a user
        to run cannot run at all on this box, and no documented
        fallback covers it.  CuPy absent is the type case: ``woof
        run`` is step 5 of First light, and without CuPy it dies in a
        raw ``ModuleNotFoundError`` after fetching gigabytes.  The
        ``[render]`` extra absent is the other: ``woof enprod`` and
        ``woof render --engine matplotlib`` are both README doors and
        both import the ``wrf`` package.

    ``degraded`` (does not block)
        An optional mode, engine or door is unavailable while a
        DOCUMENTED default still works: scipy's ``vad-region``
        dealiasing beside the shipped ``region-global`` engine, the
        rust fetch backbone beside the Python transport, cuSOLVER
        beside the bundled Jacobi kernel.

    ``opt-in`` (does not block)
        An explicit choice the operator has not made: the ~16 GB
        WPS_GEOG download, the ``dev`` extra.

    Two boundary cases are worth stating because they were argued.  A
    door that is genuinely unreachable but lives only in the CLI
    reference or the examples -- ``woof-mapped-inspect``, ``python -m
    tools.obs_fetch_mrms`` -- is reported ``unreachable`` and does NOT
    block: the exit code tracks the paths the product's own front page
    promises, and widening it to every module door would fail every
    install for routes most users never open.  And a ``present`` or
    ``untested`` finding never blocks, because neither is a claim that
    something is wrong.

    What changed on 2026-08-14, and why: CuPy's absence used to carry
    ``blocking=False``.  A bare install therefore printed ``3 gap(s), 0
    of them blocking (exit 0)`` -- a green light over a box that could
    not run a forecast -- and ``woof run-plan --probe`` inherited it
    as ``"ready": true``.  An installer script that trusts an exit code
    shipped that box.  The 1.3.1 -> 1.4.0 ``woof setup`` regression
    this function was originally written for is still handled, by the
    ``opt-in`` severity: an unfetched WPS_GEOG tree still exits 0.
