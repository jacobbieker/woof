"""Locate and drive the vendored Rusty Weather renderer (``rw_wrfbatch``).

``woof render --engine rust`` renders wrfout files through the vendored
``tools/rustwx`` workspace -- the production Rusty Weather batch
renderer, the same engine (and plot quality) as the campaign's paired
CPU-vs-GPU product sheets.  Like the GRIB bridges, the pip wheel ships
no compiled Rust: the binary is built once from the vendored workspace
(``cargo build --release --locked --offline``) and then *pointed at*,
with the same resolution ladder as :mod:`woof.bridges`:

1. the ``WOOF_RW_WRFBATCH`` environment variable naming the built file
   (a missing file it names is a hard error, never silently skipped);
2. a source checkout's ``tools/rustwx/target/{release,debug}``;
3. ``<root>/libexec/bridges`` beside the package;
4. ``~/.woof/bridges``.

The renderer draws coastlines/state/county basemaps from the vendored
Natural Earth + US Census assets in ``tools/rustwx/assets/basemap``.
When the binary runs from a checkout it finds them by walking its own
ancestors.  An installed binary has nothing above it to find: the
platform wheel stages the renderer into ``woof/libexec/bridges`` and
has no room for the shapefiles, so they ship in the ``recast-woof-data``
companion every install already pulls
(:func:`woof.data_assets.companion_basemap_dir`) and
:func:`renderer_env` pins ``RUSTWX_BASEMAP_DIR`` to the first of the
checkout assets, the companion's, and the ones ``woof fetch-bridges``
staged.  An explicit ``RUSTWX_BASEMAP_DIR``/``RUSTWX_ASSETS_DIR`` in the
caller's environment always wins.

Nothing here runs cargo.  Resolution has one side effect and one
only: an artifact found in ``~/.woof/bridges`` that is not the one this
release pinned is re-fetched before it is handed to a door
(:func:`woof.bridges.require_release_pin`).  ``woof doctor`` resolves
inside :func:`woof.bridges.inspection_only`, where there is no side
effect at all, so the report still says what the estate IS.

    The availability listing has already been paid for by the time a
    door has rows in hand; this reads them.  Every requested slug whose
    row is renderable stays in the spec, in the order it was asked for;
    every requested slug whose row is anything else comes back paired
    with the engine's OWN detail, verbatim, so the reader gets the
    engine's reason rather than a Python paraphrase of it.

    A token with no row at all passes through untouched: the group
    keywords (``all``, ``direct`` ...), the section and mesh families
    and any slug this build knows and this listing did not mention.  The
    engine is the authority on an unknown slug, and guessing here would
    refuse a spelling this build accepts.

    :data:`GENERIC_VAR_PREFIX` is the ONE exception, and it is not a
    guess.  The generic catalog enumerates the store: every stored 2-D
    variable appears, as its own row or as a deduped one folded in by
    the listing.  So a ``var:`` token with no row is PROVEN absent from
    this store, and forwarding it gets ``stored 2-D variable "X" does
    not exist`` and a failed invocation -- which is how a shipped
    preset naming two variables in wrfout spelling rather than store
    spelling discarded a whole 13-frame series.

    That proof needs the enumeration to have RUN, so it is taken from
    the listing rather than assumed: the exception applies only when
    this listing carried a generic row at all.  A listing with none has
    said nothing about the store's variables -- a build without the
    generic enumeration is one way to get one -- and reading its silence
    as absence would drop every ``var:`` request a user made, by guess,
    with the engine never asked.  Those are forwarded unchanged and the
    renderer decides, the same way :func:`catalog_rows` treats a build
    whose rows carry no machine code.

    and ``meshdiff:`` read a mesh file's cell boundaries, and ``xsec:``
    is cut along a section line.  A request that names one of them on a
    door with no mesh file and no line is answered here, with nothing
    opened and nothing launched.

    WHAT BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS (gate law).  The renderer's own answer
    to such a term is PER INVOCATION, taken before a single picture is
    drawn (``rw-wrfbatch/src/main.rs``): a ``mesh:`` term with no
    ``--mesh-grid`` is a usage error at argument validation, a ``mesh:``
    term beside store or ``xsec:`` products is refused at the entry to
    the batch render because the two families read different inputs, and
    an ``xsec:`` term with no ``--section`` is refused before the store
    render starts.  So ONE such term forwarded from a door costs every
    other requested product its pictures: measured on the shipped wheel,
    a two-product series naming ``mesh:cell_area`` exits 1 with no
    pictures at all.

    The drop is therefore per PRODUCT, which the renderer will not do
    for itself: the term goes, the rest of the request is drawn, and the
    caller reports each dropped term with the sentence returned beside
    it.  A caller left with an empty spec has nothing to draw and
    refuses rather than launching an empty render, the same signal
    :func:`catalog_verdict` gives.

    ``section`` is the line the caller will pass to the renderer.  With
    one, an ``xsec:`` term is drawable here and is kept; the mesh
    families have no such door, because no door in this package passes
    ``--mesh-grid``.

    A request that drops nothing comes back byte for byte.  One that
    drops something is rebuilt from the engine's own tokenization
    (:func:`split_section_spec`, so a section term's comma-separated
    level list stays one term), which groups the surviving section
    terms after the store terms; the renderer splits the spec into those
