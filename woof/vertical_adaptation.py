"""Derive the hybrid coordinate the run's own ground can order.

THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR.  WRF's cubic hybrid coordinate
(``hybrid_opt = 2``) can only order a column whose surface pressure stays
above a floor set by ``etac`` and ``p_top``
(:func:`woof.core.grid.hybrid_surface_pressure_floor`), and WRF itself
calls a column below that floor fatal (v4.6.1
``dyn_em/nest_init_utils.F:1158-1182``, whose message says the cause
"tends to be caused by very high topography" and whose only remedy is
"reduce etac").  This package reproduced that refusal with every number
WRF's own message leaves out -- INCLUDING the largest ``etac`` that would
order the column -- and then handed the arithmetic to the user.  A
shipped preset placed over a bay whose 12 km parent reaches the world's
highest terrain stopped at the prepare stage on a coordinate the engine
had already solved.

So the run derives the coordinate it can use.  ``etac`` becomes the
largest supported value for the LOWEST base surface pressure over every
terrain field the run can touch: each domain's static terrain at its own
resolution (a 3 km nest carries higher peaks than its 12 km parent),
every declared domain including the ones that spawn later, and for a
following nest the whole statics corridor it may traverse -- a
relocation must never be the first place the coordinate fails.

Order is not enough.  A column the coordinate only just orders keeps one
layer a sliver of its flat-ground depth: a generated 1 km forecast under
the highest central Andes was ordered at etac 0.2 with layer 20 at 1.2%
of its flat depth, and it stopped at model second 350 with that layer
running away over the peak, on six acoustic substeps and on the adaptive
clock alike.  So the derived ``etac`` is the largest one that keeps the
thinnest layer of every column at least :data:`MIN_LAYER_FRACTION` of
its flat-column depth, and where no ``etac`` reaches that, the one that
leaves that layer thickest.

What this is NOT.  It is not a change to the base state or to the
coefficient formulas: both stay transcribed from WRF.  It does not touch
``p_top``: ``etac`` is WRF's own named remedy and it keeps the model top
where the user put it.  And it does not retire the refusal, which still
stands for the one case it always named: terrain so high that no positive
``etac`` orders it.

      exactly where the steepest discrete ``dB/deta`` is not above 1,
      a comparison ``p_top`` does not enter.
