"""The mp=28 aerosol source, carried from the ingest into a run report.

WHAT WAS MISSING.  :func:`woof.ingest.real.initialize_real` already
decides -- and already writes down -- which of two initial conditions an
aerosol-aware Thompson run received: WRF's global monthly
water/ice-friendly aerosol climatology
(``QNWFA_QNIFA_SIGMA_MONTHLY.dat``), or ``thompson_init``'s synthetic
CCN/IN profile (``phys/module_mp_thompson.F:493-551``).  That decision is
the run's ``RealInitResult.aerosol_initialization`` receipt and it is
announced on stderr by
``woof.ingest.real._warn_synthetic_aerosol_fallback``.  Console
scrollback is not a record: two forecasts that differ in which of those
two the model started from are different experiments, and a reader
holding only ``report.json`` could not tell which one they had.  This
module is the one place that turns that receipt into a report key, so
every writer says it the same way.

THE TWO ABSENCES ARE DIFFERENT FACTS, and blurring them is the concrete
breakage this module exists to prevent.

  1. ABSENT BECAUSE INAPPLICABLE.  WSM6, Morrison, classic Thompson,
     Kessler and every other scheme have no water-friendly/ice-friendly
     aerosol number fields at all -- only ``thompsonaero`` carries
     qnwfa / qnifa / qnwfa2d / qnifa2d (``Registry.EM_COMMON:3036``).
     There is no dataset such a run could have read and none it failed
     to read.  Such a run gets NO KEY: :func:`aerosol_source_report_entry`
     returns an empty mapping and the report is the report it was before
     this module existed, key for key.  A key reading "no aerosol dataset
     was used" on a WSM6 run would be true of the bytes and false of the
     meaning -- it would put a WSM6 report and a climatology-less mp=28
     report in one bucket, which is exactly the pair a reader needs told
     apart.

  2. ABSENT BECAUSE THE FALLBACK WAS TAKEN.  An mp_physics=28 run that
     searched for the dataset and did not find it ran on an analytic
     profile.  That IS "no dataset was used", it is a material fact about
     the forecast, and it is reported loudly: ``dataset_used`` is
     ``False`` and ``aerosol_source`` names
     ``thompson_init-synthetic-profile``.

  3. And a third, so the second is never guessed at: an mp=28 run whose
     writer holds no ingest receipt at all -- a route initialized from an
     archived parent frame, a prepared cache written before the receipt
     was recorded.  ``recorded`` is ``False`` and ``dataset_used`` is
     ABSENT rather than ``False``: "not recorded" and "no dataset" are
     not the same sentence.  Each caller supplies its own
     ``when_unrecorded`` naming what its route actually knows.

WHY A MODULE RATHER THAN A HELPER IN ``real.py``.  The writers that need
this are report assemblers -- ``woof.prepared_single_domain_forecast``,
the offline-child runners, the native benchmark and proof harnesses --
and several of them never import the real ingest at all.  This module
imports nothing but the standard library, so adding the key costs a
report writer nothing.
