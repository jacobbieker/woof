"""Production canonical frame-state hashing shared by run controllers.

The hash is model evidence, not a verification-only implementation detail.
Keeping it in the production package prevents run/benchmark entry points from
depending on the developer-only ``woof.verify`` tree.

TWO PLACES A DOMAIN CAN LIVE, ONE DIGEST
----------------------------------------
:func:`canonical_state_digest` walks a resident ``DomainState``.  A streamed
forecast has one; a STORE-DIRECT forecast does not, and that is the whole
point of it -- ``woof.ingest.prepared_store`` builds the domain slab by slab
into pinned host RAM precisely so no domain-shaped device state is ever
allocated, and above the card's ceiling none can be.  Pointing the resident
walker at whatever state such a run happens to be holding is not an error
that announces itself: with ``store = "host"`` the attached state is the
snapshot that FILLED the store and never moves again, so the final digest of
a six-hour forecast is the digest of its analysis, complete, self-consistent
and wrong.

:func:`canonical_store_digest` is the same digest taken off the store, and
the two must agree BIT FOR BIT for the same weather.  Three things make that
a claim rather than a hope:

*One hasher.*  Both routes assemble a ``{member name: array}`` manifest and
hand it to :func:`_canonical_digest_document`, which is the only code in this
module that touches ``hashlib``.  There is no second serialization to drift.

*One member-name mapping.*  The store is already keyed by the restart
archive's own member names (``state/thp``, ``scratch/mp_rainnc``,
``driver/pbl_tendencies/ru``, ``fields/ust``) because
``tilestream.physics_inventory.carrier_manifest`` IS
``restart.state_manifest`` + ``_scratch_manifest`` +
``carried_scratch_manifest`` + ``_driver_manifest`` merged, in that order.
So :func:`_canonical_store_manifest` reads the
store through ``carrier_inventory`` -- the same call
``tilestream.restart_stream.write_streamed_restart`` writes a byte-identical
archive out of -- and re-applies the digest's own membership rules to the
KEYS.  It does not maintain a table of names.

*One normalisation.*  The resident road hashes device arrays pulled through
``restart._host`` (a ``.get()``); the store road hashes pinned host arrays
that were never on the card.  :func:`_canonical_host` is the single funnel,
and it says out loud what a host array can carry that a ``.get()`` never
produces -- a non-native byte order, which would move both the member
descriptor and every payload byte.

WHAT THE STORE CANNOT CARRY, STATED RATHER THAN PAPERED OVER
------------------------------------------------------------
Two member classes are in the resident digest and are absent from a
store-direct domain's, and both absences are properties of the run rather
than of this module.  (A third, ``restart.RESTART_ONLY_DRIVER_SLOTS``, is
absent from BOTH: the resident walk reaches it through
``restart._driver_manifest`` and :func:`canonical_state_digest` subtracts it
again by the same name the store side does, because a member one road can
never produce is not evidence -- it is a difference between two roads
reporting the same weather.)  ``scratch/lbc_weights_0`` is created on FIRST
FORCE by ``lateral_bc._resident_weights`` on whichever state stepped; a
streamed domain steps tile buffers, so it does not exist on the domain
object either way, and a store-direct run has no domain object at all.  The
``nest_*`` rolling tables belong to a coupled child, and streaming refuses a
nest.  A store that nonetheless turns up carrying an unrecognised member
under one of :data:`_CANONICAL_EXTRA_PREFIXES` is refused here exactly as
the resident walk refuses one, because that is the shape a silently-dropped
member class arrives in.
