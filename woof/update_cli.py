"""``woof update``: the upgrade command for THIS environment, printed.

A reader who has a version and wants the next one reaches for ``woof
update`` before they reach for a README, and until now that gesture
answered ``invalid choice: 'update'`` -- an error message that says the
tool does not know the word, not that the upgrade is ``pip``.  A field
run on the shipped 1.5.0 wheel filed exactly that.

This command PRINTS and never executes.  Upgrading the interpreter's own
packages from inside a process that interpreter is running is how a
half-replaced install happens: pip would be rewriting files under the
running process's import path, and the failure mode is a traceback in a
module that no longer matches the one already imported.  So the whole
value here is discovery -- naming the distribution this install actually
came from, and the exact command for this interpreter -- and the reader
runs it from their shell, where it is safe.

The distribution is resolved, not assumed.  Two distributions publish
the ``woof`` package (the full wheel and the preprocessing-only one),
and :func:`woof.runtime_manifest.installed_distribution` already answers
"which one installed the code that is running" by locating the package
file that was actually imported.  Printing ``pip install --upgrade
woof`` to somebody whose install came from the other distribution would
be an instruction that installs a second copy rather than upgrading the
one they have.

Downloaded assets are not part of the wheel and do not move when it is
replaced: the bridges and the physics tables are staged under the user
data directory precisely so an upgrade cannot delete them.  That is
stated here because the alternative -- a reader who assumes a 315 MiB
download has to be repeated -- costs the download.
