"""The acoustic substep count each domain's own terrain needs.

THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR.  A generated 500 m forecast over the central
Andes (33 S, 70.1 W) ran the four acoustic substeps per 2.5 s step every
generated configuration carries, and its surface w passed 200 m/s over
3657 m terrain at model second 40.  The same prepared forecast ran its full
hour with six substeps and with eight.  Nothing in the configuration was
wrong for the ground it was written for; four substeps are simply not
stable over ground that steep.

THE PHYSICS.  The split-explicit acoustic step advances the horizontal
pressure gradient explicitly and the vertical one implicitly, off-centred
by ``epssm``.  On a sloping terrain-following surface the explicit
horizontal gradient carries the slope times the vertical pressure
gradient, so steep ground couples the explicit half of the step to the
fast vertical acoustic modes the implicit half exists to hold.  WRF's own
guidance is the same statement from the other side: the off-centering
should exceed the slope for stability (Dudhia, from the MM5 slope
analysis).  Every shipped profile carries ``epssm = 0.5``.

MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED.  :data:`STABLE_SLOPE_BY_OFFCENTERING` is the
engine's own stability map: a bell ridge in a uniform cross-ridge wind,
integrated through the production ``step()`` with the generated dynamics
(the 49-level hybrid ladder, ``smdiv``/``emdiv``, ``w_damping``, the
slope-tapered sixth-order filter, the Rayleigh lid) at 250 m, 500 m and
1 km on the generated 5 s per km clock, ridges 750 m to 5 km tall, cross
winds 10 to 25 m/s, ``epssm`` 0.1 to 1.0, with isolated mountains and a
ridge at 45 degrees to the grid beside them.  Over that map:

* the slope at which four substeps first fail rises with ``epssm`` (0.45
  at 0.1, 0.75 at 0.5) and does not move with the wind; the tallest,
  widest ridges fail first, so they set every bound;
* six substeps hold 0.1 to 0.2 more slope, and eight hold no more than
  six;
* a shorter long step does not move the four-substep boundary between 2
  and 5 s per km, so a larger count, not a smaller ``dt``, is the remedy;
* the steepest slope in any direction governs: a ridge at 45 degrees to
  the grid failed four substeps at a slope of 0.75 though no face saw
  more than 0.53, a little below the ridge along the grid, and an
  isolated mountain is no more stable than a ridge;
* the bounds below held three hours on the widest ridge across the grid
  at 250 m and 500 m: at ``epssm`` 0.5, four substeps at a slope of 0.70
  and six at 0.85 (six at 0.90 held an hour and a half at 250 m, then
  failed).

The real forecasts agree: the Andes at 500 m (steepest slope 0.89) fails
with four and runs with six; Hawaii at 1 km (0.33), the Rockies at 500 m
(0.36) and the Iowa plains (0.02) run with four.

WHERE THE MAP ENDS.  The wind in the map is 10 to 25 m/s.  Under a jet at
crest height the four-substep bound falls over the tallest ground: at
1 km, crests of 5.5 and 6.5 km stopped on four substeps at slopes of 0.6
to 0.65 under 50 to 60 m/s and held three hours on six, while a 5 km
crest held 0.65 on four at 70 m/s and 500 m held 0.65 on four at 60 m/s.
At 3 km, 4.5 and 5 km crests of slope 0.4 under 60 to 70 m/s stopped
within two minutes on four and on six alike, so there the long step,
not the substep count, is the limit.  This rule reads slope and
off-centering only; :mod:`woof.terrain_clock` reads the crest-level
wind beside the same slope and takes six substeps or a shorter long step
where its own map, measured under winds to 100 m/s, says either is needed.

WHAT THIS DOES.  Each domain's steepest slope in any direction
(:func:`steepest_slope`, map factor applied) is read off the terrain that
domain integrates.  Where it reaches the bound below which four substeps
were measured stable at the domain's ``epssm``, ``time_step_sound`` is
raised to six.  A count is never lowered, so a configuration that asked
for more keeps it, and a domain on gentler ground runs exactly as
configured.  Past the slope six substeps hold, the run still takes six
(the most stable count measured) and says plainly that its ground is
steeper than any stable measurement.

UNDER THE ADAPTIVE CLOCK the configured count is not the one that runs:
the clock derives the count from its live step every root step, and that
gives four at every short step.  There the rule reads the count the clock
takes at its shortest steps (:func:`woof.core.adaptive_clock
.least_sound_steps`) and writes six as ``min_time_step_sound``, the floor
the clock keeps its derived count at or above, so the six reach the
dynamics and a domain on gentler ground keeps WRF's derived count.
