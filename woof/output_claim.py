"""Live ownership of one output path, including supervised worker handoff.

The supervisor and its worker hold shared OS leases for the same random token.
A new launch needs an exclusive lease before it may adopt an empty directory.
Kernel-released locks make an interrupted launch recoverable without trusting a
PID, estimating its lifetime, or deleting any forecast files.
