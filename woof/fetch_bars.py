"""Record-count bars: derived from the live inventory, tripwired by the
certified constants.

A downloaded subset has to carry exactly the records the fail-closed
bridges select, and ``woof fetch`` refuses anything else.  For a long
time the bar was a hardcoded integer -- 124 for the GFS NOMADS subset,
561 and 18 for the HRRR native and soil subsets.  That is correct right
up until NCEP changes an inventory, at which point a hardcode turns a
routine upstream change into a mystery breakage with no remedy in the
error text.

So the bar is now **derived** from the index of the very object being
fetched, and the certified constants stay on as a **tripwire**:

* derived == certified -- the ordinary case, nothing is said;
* derived != certified -- a loud, specific warning naming both numbers
  and what changed, and the fetch refuses unless the operator passes
  ``--accept-inventory-change``.

Never silently adapt (a quietly smaller subset is a corrupt
initialization), and never mystery-break (an operator who has read the
warning can proceed in one flag).  Accepting a change is a deliberate
re-certification event and the manifest records that it happened.

    ``certified`` overrides the table entry for requests whose census is
    a known function of the request itself rather than a fixed number.
    The GFS selection is the case: it takes five records per isobaric
    level, so a run that asks for a model top above 100 hPa fetches a
    longer ladder and legitimately expects more than 124 records.  The
    tripwire still fires -- it is simply aimed at the count this
    request's ladder implies, not at the count the default ladder
    implies, which would otherwise refuse every deeper top as an
    upstream inventory change.

    ``on_refusal`` is for callers that can only derive the bar *after*
    the payload has landed -- the Rust HRRR transport reads the census
    out of the index it kept beside the object it just wrote.  Such a
    caller passes a zero-argument callable that disposes of the payload
    and returns one sentence saying what is now on disk; it runs before
    the refusal is raised, and its sentence replaces
    :data:`NOTHING_DOWNLOADED`.  Without it the refusal claims nothing
    was downloaded, which is only true when the bar came first.
