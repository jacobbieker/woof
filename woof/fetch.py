"""Acquire initialization/boundary data: the ``woof fetch`` front door.

This module is transport only.  It downloads (or, for ERA5, templates and
validates) the exact source inventory the fail-closed Rust GRIB bridges
consume downstream; it never decodes scientific payloads itself.  Every
published file is envelope-verified, sha256-summed, and recorded in a
``fetch-manifest.json`` the preparation step can consume.

Per-source transport:

Every NCEP source here is asked for along an ENDPOINT LADDER declared
in ``authorities/rw-wps-fetch-routes.v1.json`` and resolved by
:mod:`woof.fetch_endpoints`: the operational server
(``nomads.ncep.noaa.gov``) while it still holds the cycle, the AWS Open
Data archive behind it.  The two publish the same relative key with the
same bytes and differ in three ways only -- the operational server has
a latest cycle hours before any mirror does, it keeps a bounded window,
and it paces bulk transfers where the archive does not.

Retention decides which rungs are ASKED; throughput decides which one
SERVES.  Inside the retention window each requested object is HEADed on
the archive first, and the archive takes any object it has already
mirrored, because the operational server's head start is spent the
moment both hosts have the same bytes.  An object the archive has not
caught up with comes from the operational server, which is what that
host is for.  Promotion reorders the ladder and never shortens it, so
fall-through is unchanged.  ``--transport`` pins one rung, disables
fall-through and skips the probe.

* ``gfs`` -- two first-class byte transports.  The default is the NOMADS
  ``filter_gfs_0p25.pl`` subsetter (spatial subregion + the exact
  variable/level selection): rate-governed, bandwidth-frugal, re-encoded
  by NOMADS to south-to-north simple packing.  ``--mode full-file``
  takes the whole ``pgrb2.0p25`` objects along the ladder instead --
  whole-globe north-to-south (scan 0x00) complex-packed (DRT 5.3)
  grids, both certified in ``gfs_grib2_bridge`` by committed matched
  pairs (the scan-order flip and the SOILW missing-value proof; see
  ``tests/fixtures/gfs-scan-order/README.md``) -- through either the
  Rust backbone's parallel range GETs or the stdlib transport.  ``.idx``
  byte-range subsetting of the raw objects is NOT a certified GFS route.
  ``--cycle latest`` walks the same ladder with anonymous HEAD probes
  (no HTML scraping), so it resolves the newest cycle that EXISTS
  rather than the newest one the archive has caught up with.
* ``hrrr`` -- NOAA ``.idx`` byte-range subsetting, reusing the proven
  record inventory and range transport in
  :mod:`tools.download_hrrr_native_subset` (native hybrid ``wrfnat``
  atmosphere plus the soil records of ``wrfprs``, the inputs
  ``hrrr_grib2_bridge`` requires), over either of two hosts serving the
  identical production files and indexes: the NOMADS operational server
  (``nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/data/nccf/com/hrrr/prod``, roughly the
  newest 48 h, where each hour publishes first) and the AWS Open Data
  S3 archive ``noaa-hrrr-bdp-pds``.  ``--transport auto`` (default)
  asks the archive for the requested window first and takes it when it
  already serves it, falling back to the operational server for a
  window the archive has not caught up with, and skipping the doomed
  probe entirely for a cycle older than the operational window.
  NOMADS
  has no grib-filter route for these products -- its HRRR filter
  scripts cover the 2-D ``wrfsfc`` file only -- so subsetting stays
  ``.idx`` byte ranges on both hosts and the exact 561/18 record
  contracts are unchanged.  The bytes move whole by default
  (:data:`HRRR_DEFAULT_MODE`, through the Rust backbone's parallel
  range GETs); ``--mode idx-subset`` is the opt-in bandwidth saver.  ``--wait-for`` polls (at most every 30 s)
  and downloads each forecast hour as it publishes, so preparation can
  start before a live cycle finishes publishing.  HRRR objects are
  CONUS-wide; ``.idx`` subsetting selects records, not areas, so
  ``--area`` is validated against CONUS coverage rather than used to
  crop.
* ``era5`` -- no CDS download is implemented (the CDS API requires a user
  account and key).  ``fetch`` emits the precise ``cdsapi`` request
  template for the variables/levels/times/area woof ingest expects and,
  with ``--validate``, checks a user-supplied GRIB1 file set against that
  expectation (transport envelopes via
  :func:`woof.ingest.grib.inspect_grib1_envelopes` plus a
  parameter/level/valid-time census).  The Rust bridge remains the decode
  authority at ingest time.

No case is named here; sources (GFS/HRRR/ERA5) are public data products,
not cases.

    and a later start asks for valid times the provider has not published
    yet.  A forecast source covers its window with leads from one cycle,

    Two doors resolve the same latest and must agree about one request:
    :func:`resolve_latest_cycle`, which serves ``--cycle latest`` and

    whose calendar publishes ``latest_candidate`` and resolves the Latest
    button.  Each used to subtract the window itself, so on that path it
    came off twice: an era5 240-hour window selected a cycle ten days
    before the same document's own ``latest_candidate``, silently.

    The subtraction happens AFTER ``newest()``, because a rolling
    publication delay and a closed archive's ``record_end`` both bound
    the LAST analysis requested and only ``newest()`` applies both;
    subtracting from ``now`` alone gets a closed archive wrong.  The
    delay is added back so the answer is a reference INSTANT rather than
    a cycle: ``grid.newest()`` of it is the newest usable start, and

    each forecast hour before the cloud mirrors do and keeps only about
    :data:`HRRR_NOMADS_RETENTION_HOURS`; the S3 archive lags and keeps
    everything.

    ``auto`` asks the THROUGHPUT rung first and takes it when it

    The window's FINAL hour is what is probed, on either host, for the
    same reason ``resolve_latest_cycle`` probes it: publication within
    a cycle runs forward, so a host serving the last hour serves every
    earlier one.

    One decision per invocation, so a fetch never silently mixes hosts;
    the manifest records every file's actual URL and transport either

    """The four-file front door, on the GFS container routes too.

    DATA.md promises every fetched directory ``inputs.txt`` +
    ``prep-command.txt`` + ``SHA256SUMS`` + ``fetch-manifest.json``, and
    the table routes keep that promise; the GFS route left three grib2
    files, a tsv and a manifest -- a pile, not a front door (UX finding
    N11).  Written BEFORE each manifest publication and returned as
    manifest rows, so an interrupted fetch's files describe exactly the
    verified prefix the manifest records, and the manifest claims every
    canonical file the fetch put in the directory.

    The order and the binding are the contract, not decoration.  These
    three landed after the manifest and unlisted, which left the audited
    receipt under-claiming its own directory -- three canonical,
    undigested files a reader had to take on trust -- and left a window
    between the manifest rename and theirs where a kill published a
    complete-looking receipt beside the PREVIOUS run's checksum list and
    input list.  Publishing them first and hashing them into ``files``
    makes the manifest the publication barrier the rest of this module
    already treats it as, and matches the HRRR route, which has always
    written ``SHA256SUMS`` first and carried it as a ``checksums`` row.

    ``prep-command.txt`` carries the BOUND half only, like every table
    route's: the namelist, config, geography and output root are the
    reader's.  The digest binding is not a fifth file to author by hand
    -- ``woof prep --source gfs`` authors and binds the input manifest
    itself when ``--source-manifest`` is omitted.

    the previous ``fetch-manifest.json`` stayed canonical -- so a kill
    (or a network failure) part-way through left a readable manifest

    refuses accurately.  The receipt class is the whole front door, not

    resolved payload paths and ``prep-command.txt`` binds the series, so
    sweeping either of them at payload rank could leave a readable file

    *Every file, as advertised.*  The CLI has always said force moves
    every existing file in ``--out`` aside; it actually moved only the
    payload paths the new request selected.  Forecast hours outside a
    shortened window, ``.idx`` indexes, selector files, stale ``.part``
    files and unrelated files all stayed canonical -- old payloads that
    the new manifest does not list, and sidecars that can block the
    recovery force was invoked to perform.  Now the sweep matches the

    Reuses the proven ``.idx`` selection/range transport in
    :mod:`tools.download_hrrr_native_subset` per product (atmosphere
    ``wrfnat`` subset + soil records of ``wrfprs``), adds resumability,
    and writes the fetch manifest plus ``SHA256SUMS``.  An existing file
    is skipped only when it passes the same completeness bar as a fresh
    download (envelope walk + the exact 561/18 record counts) and, when
    a prior manifest recorded its digest, still matches that digest;
    anything else is moved aside and re-downloaded, never re-blessed.
    HRRR files are CONUS-wide: ``--area`` is a coverage check, not a
    crop.

    ``transport`` selects the host ('s3' or 'nomads'; both serve
    byte-identical files and indexes, so every bar above is
    host-independent and a directory fetched over one host resumes over
    the other).  ``wait`` is the live-cycle mode: hours are fetched in
    order, each product polled (at most every
    :data:`HRRR_WAIT_POLL_SECONDS` seconds) until it publishes; under
    ``transport='auto'`` each round tries NOMADS first, then S3.  On
    timeout the manifest is still written for the contiguous complete
    prefix -- so a re-run of the same command resumes instead of
    refusing -- and a ``RuntimeError`` reports exactly what was and was
    not fetched.

    The manifest is republished after every **completed hour**, and it
    claims only the files of the hours it declares complete.  Both
    halves matter: without the first, an ordinary kill after many good
    hours leaves a fresh output with valid payloads and no receipt at
    all; without the second, the timeout path publishes the
    half-fetched hour's atmosphere in ``files`` and ``SHA256SUMS``
    while ``forecast_hours`` names only the earlier prefix -- one
    receipt with two definitions of complete.  A half-fetched hour
    stays on disk unclaimed and is re-verified under the ordinary bars
    on the next run.

    ``engine`` selects the downloader: ``'python'`` is the stdlib
    byte-range transport in :mod:`tools.download_hrrr_native_subset`,
    ``'rust'`` the vendored ``rw_fetch`` backbone (parallel range GETs,
    the cross-process NOMADS rate governor, a disk cache).  ``mode`` is
    the byte transport the backbone uses -- under ``'auto'`` a lagging
    or short ``.idx`` lands the **whole** object instead of a subset,
    which is bigger on disk and still exactly what
    ``hrrr_grib2_bridge`` wants, because that bridge selects by field
    identity rather than by file size.

    ``transport_fallback`` lists further hosts to try, in order, when
    the chosen one publishes an index whose inventory this WOOF does
    not recognise.  The two hosts do **not** publish identical index
    vocabularies -- see ``download_hrrr_native_subset.FIELD_ALIASES`` --
    and a host that has genuinely changed something is a reason to move
    on with an explanation rather than to abort a fetch the other host
    can serve.  Network faults remain the transport's own to retry.
