"""One accurate sentence before the first run's invisible kernel compile.

The first GPU forecast on a machine pays on the order of two minutes of
NVRTC compilation -- every physics module's ``cupy.RawModule`` and the
direct-NVRTC radiation translation units compile for the local card
before a single model step runs.  CuPy writes the compiled binaries to
its on-disk kernel cache, so every later run loads them in seconds; but
on the run that pays, nothing said so.  The first field run of the
published wheel watched the forecast phase sit at a stale status for a
hundred seconds and reasonably wondered whether it had hung.

This module is the one place that knows how to ask "is that about to
happen?".  It asks it two ways, because the first way provably missed:

**Cold cache.**  The CuPy kernel cache directory (``CUPY_CACHE_DIR``
when set, else ``~/.cupy/kernel_cache`` -- CuPy's own documented
resolution) with no compiled entries in it means every kernel this run
needs is about to be built from source.

**A cache for a different card.**  CuPy's cache key includes the target
architecture (``cupy/cuda/compiler.py`` mixes ``arch`` into the hash it
names the file after), so entries compiled for one card cannot be
loaded by another -- a card swap recompiles everything against a cache
that is not empty at all.  MEASURED, 2026-08-16: this project's
reference box had 7,164 sm_120 entries when its 5090 was moved out and
a 3080 moved in; the cold-cache test said "warm", no notice was
printed, and 51 seconds of sm_86 compilation ran silently inside the
wall clock of model step 1.  That is the case
:func:`kernel_cache_state` exists to catch.

The architecture is read from the entry itself.  A CuPy cache file is
the 40-character SHA1 of the blob followed by the blob, and for a cubin
that blob is a CUDA ELF whose ``e_flags`` carries the SM version.  WHERE
in ``e_flags`` depends on the ELF layout the compiler wrote, which the
header names in ``EI_OSABI`` and ``EI_ABIVERSION``, and real caches hold
both (:data:`_SM_SHIFT_BY_LAYOUT`).  Reading one layout's byte out of
the other's header was a measured false notice: NVRTC 12.9.86 wrote
every sm_86 cubin with ``e_flags`` 0x00560556, the second byte of that
is 0x05, and every warm run on an RTX 3080 announced a recompile "for
sm_86 (the cache carries sm_5)" while it was already stepping.

An entry that does not decode -- a PTX fallback, a truncated write, a
layout this module has not measured -- counts as **possibly this
card's**, never as evidence against it: announcing a two-minute compile
on the strength of a file we could not read is a false positive that
teaches a reader to ignore the line.

No CUDA import happens in any predicate here; every question is
answered from the filesystem alone, so callers may ask before touching
the device.  The one function that does need the device is
:func:`current_compute_capability`, which is separate, optional, and
returns ``None`` rather than raising when there is no card to ask.
