    DESIGN A136 2.4 item 3 for the mapped engine.  Indexing a forcing time
    waits for its lead's marker (``PostedLeads``), then decodes every lead
    whose marker is there and is not decoded yet in one
    ``decode_composed_source`` run, on all cores, under a sub-manifest
    authored for that batch.  The batches run one at a time in the
    preparation's thread, so the compose never holds more than one batch,
    and a batch is never more than the whole window.

    What a batch reads: the leads' own objects (each held to the digest
    its marker names), every object the route fetched with the first lead
    group but that belongs to no lead (a cycle-invariant field, step-0
    statics), and every input the route does not plan (a donor analysis
    fetched before the first lead).  Where the route concatenated parts
    into the window's first lead's file alone (the cycle's step-0 statics),
    a batch without that lead decodes it again and keeps only its own
    times (:meth:`_needs_first_lead`).  A supplement role drawn from the
    primary inventory (a source whose own files carry its surface) follows
    the batch; any other supplement is read whole by every batch and must
    be there when the first batch is decoded.

    """Build native WRF inputs from one complete mapped-source composition.

    All mixed-product semantics are resolved before target interpolation.
    The root owns the complete external-LBC sequence; mapped child inputs are
    initialized independently and finalized parent-before-child.  Products
    are published atomically only after source and run-control authorities are
    reverified.

    ``stock_wrf_export`` defaults to an optional companion WRF file set.
    ``required`` refuses unsupported configurations before ingest; ``off``
    prepares only the native forecast artifacts. Only the named unsupported
    export condition is recoverable; I/O and corrupt-array failures still fail.

    ``static_input``/``static_receipt`` supply a previously published
    native-static NPZ instead of rebuilding the root domain's geography from
    WPS_GEOG, exactly as the ERA5/GFS/HRRR adapters already accept.  The
    receipt binds the target geometry contract and the NPZ SHA-256, and the
    loader re-derives MAPFAC/F/E/SINALPHA/COSALPHA from the grid, so a cache
    that does not belong to this domain is refused rather than trusted.
    ``geog_root`` remains required either way: the proof's geog_datasets
    binding and any child-domain statics are still resolved from the tree.

    ``statics_corridor`` opts this preparation into emitting the sealed
    child-resolution statics corridors
    (:func:`woof.static.corridor.emit_statics_corridor_set`), exactly as
    the GFS and HRRR hierarchy stages already do.  It is what a RELOCATING
    nest needs and cannot rebuild for itself: a prepared bundle runs with
    no GEOG source, so the ground a nest has not visited yet has to be
    sealed at preparation time or the move has nothing to stand on.
    ``woof.prepared_domain_tree_forecast`` refuses a configured
    ``[relocation]`` against a bundle that carries no corridor for the
    mover, by name -- so a mapped tree that means to move MUST pass this.
    ``None`` selects nothing, ``"all"`` every child, and a sequence
    exactly those child grid ids; the resolution itself belongs to
    :func:`woof.static.corridor.validated_corridor_selection`, which the
    hierarchy call applies, so this route cannot resolve a bare flag to a
    different set than `run-plan --estimate` priced.

    ``_source_manifest``/``_source_manifest_sha256`` are the seam for a
    NAMED-SOURCE route whose user-facing sealed authority is its own
    manifest schema (the 20CRv3 member manifest, with its filename-bound
    member identity): the route verifies its own document, authors the
    generic composition-inputs manifest FROM it, and hands both here.
    The composition decodes against the bridged manifest -- which the
    composition receipt seals -- while the prepared tree's evidence copy,
    identity chain and proof stay bound to the route's own document, the
    one its forecast leg re-verifies with the route's own reader.  Absent,
    the two manifests are the same document and nothing changes.

    ``as_posted`` is an as-posted fetch's ``posting/`` folder (DESIGN A136
    2.4): the preparation starts on the window's first lead and decodes the
    later leads batch by batch as their markers appear
    (:class:`_PostedMappedSource`), and ``input_manifest`` is where its
    seal writes the window's manifest (beside the fetched files) with the
    one-shot author, so ``input_manifest_sha256`` is ``None``.  The head
    binds the input plan and the first leads' markers; the seal writes the
    composition receipt, the vertical ladder and the one-shot identity, and
    the prepared arrays are the one-shot preparation's byte for byte.
