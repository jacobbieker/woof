"""One CUDA device/driver/runtime probe, shared by every receipt that needs it.

The probe lives here rather than inside
:func:`woof.native_wrf_distribution.verify_runtime` because a probe bound to
the native-WRF bridge inventory cannot be called from a forecast: the bridge
receipt asks the device what it is, and nothing else in the tree can ask the
same question of the same code.  Both consumers import this module and call
the same function object, so a change to what the probe measures reaches every
receipt that carries a device block instead of only the one it was written for.

The block's key set is the published ``gpuwm-native-wrf-runtime-v1`` shape;
``tests/data/native_wrf_runtime_gpu_block_pre_change.json`` holds it as
transcribed from the source that predates this module.
