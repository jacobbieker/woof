"""``woof domain``: turn "my location + my GPU" into an experiment TOML.

The wizard emits a complete ``[experiment]``/``[projection]``/``[shared]``/
``[[domain]]`` TOML centered on ``--point`` or fitted around a local
``--polygon`` GeoJSON footprint, with grid dimensions chosen so
the itemized VRAM estimate (:func:`woof.core.preflight.estimate_experiment`)
plus the machine-peak envelope over it
(:func:`woof.core.preflight.machine_peak_envelope_bytes`) fits the
requested card's budget with headroom to spare.  Nothing here is a new
model of anything: the
physics/dynamics block is the product's default suite (the four-domain
reference configuration's selections with the microphysics slot on
Thompson mp8, the wrf-matched-run scheme), the projection
and nest-registration math is the existing :mod:`woof.static.projection`
(lambert/mercator/polar, auto-selected from the point latitude), and the
memory arithmetic is the existing preflight estimator called in-process.

Accuracy contract (terrain/static story): woof builds static fields from a
locally staged NCAR WPS_GEOG tree (nine fixed dataset directories -- see
``GEOG_DATASETS``); ``woof fetch-geog`` downloads and stages it.
Forcing data for the
config-driven ``woof check``/``run`` front door is decoded by the native
GRIB1 route, i.e. ERA5 today.  GFS/HRRR downloads (``woof fetch``) feed
the ``rw-wps``/``woof-wrf-init`` native initialization front door, which
consumes the same ``[experiment]``/``[[domain]]`` tables but not
``[case_data]``.  The wizard therefore emits ``[case_data]`` only for
``--source era5`` and prints the exact accurate next step for every source
instead of pretending a pipeline exists.

Sizing conventions (all documented, none silent):

* Automatic sizing uses the local probe's available VRAM. Explicit card
  declarations use the free VRAM a card of that capacity usually presents
  (:func:`card_assumed_free_gib` -- never the nameplate; see
  :data:`CARD_UNAVAILABLE_VRAM_GIB`) minus THIS configuration's own
  reserve (:func:`sizing_budget_bytes`, the same
  ``ReservePolicy.n0_alloc`` call ``woof check`` makes).  The reserve is
  not flat: it carries the local-memory backing store of the selected
  kernel set, which is 1.93 GiB for WSM6+MYNN and 3.94 for NSSL2
  double-moment, and a fit loop assuming a flat figure emitted configs
  that failed their own check.
* Fit criterion: ``peak envelope <= budget - fit_headroom_bytes`` --
  the estimator's own machine-peak envelope, which is AFFINE (the
  itemized estimate, plus the non-pool residency that scales with the
  device rather than the grid, plus a measured constant and a per-nest
  fraction), on every driver model and radiation lane alike since A163
  retired the pool-slack term -- the same model `woof check` and
  `woof go` price, so
  a wizard PASS cannot become a check refusal on the same machine
  state.  The loop stops SHORT of the budget on purpose: a config that
  exactly touches its budget has nothing left for the machine to be
  slightly less generous than the model, which is how every v1.4.0
  ladder came to sit 0.01-0.19 GiB from the wall.
* Root time step: the real-data recommendation, 5 s per km of grid
  spacing (60 s at 12 km), halved inside the tropics. An omitted clock
  may be shortened to land the requested event schedule exactly; children divide
  down the ratio chain exactly, and a half-second root clock is carried
  exactly through WRF's rational clock keys.
* Ladders: the presets in ``LADDER_RATIOS``, or ``--root-dx`` +
  ``--chain`` for an arbitrary root spacing and integer refinement
  chain.  Both go through the same fit loop, loader, and ``woof
  check``; a chain reaching below 1 km with a 1-D PBL scheme active
  earns a gray-zone advisory (never a refusal).

#: the desktop asks for) memory stops binding at all, and a 7 GiB card
#: sized a 12 km root of 2326 x 1860 mass points -- 27,912 x 22,320 km,
#: wider than the Earth's circumference at that latitude, wrapped around
#: the projection pole, and therefore refused at plan review by the
#: pole guard for a request that named a point in the mid-latitudes.
#: Large resident cards reached the same place more slowly (180 GiB
#: sized 26,952 km).
#:
#: 6,000 km per axis is the product's own documented continental
#: examples, measured as GROUND: they run 60-80 degrees of longitude and
#: 30-50 of latitude (the range :data:`_WIDE_FOOTPRINT_DEGREES` and
#: :data:`_TALL_FOOTPRINT_DEGREES` record), which between 35 and 45 N is
#: about 4,700-7,300 km of longitude and 3,300-5,600 km of latitude.  A
#: 6,000 x 4,800 km root sits inside both spans, so a point is sized to
#: the largest domain this product actually shows anyone running, and
#: not to whatever the card holds.
#:
#: What it is NOT is a promise about the FETCH BOX, which this comment's
#: first version claimed it was.  Those two degree thresholds are
#: applied to the margined lat/lon box (:func:`oversized_footprint_advisory`
#: reads the ``--area`` string), not to the root, and a conformal root
#: of this size fans out well past them: measured on the desktop's own

#: 41.5 N, and the source's full 360-degree band at 60 N, where a
#: 4,800 km tall Lambert domain reaches into the high Arctic.  So the
#: oversized-footprint advisory still fires on a capped point fit, by
#: design: the download IS large and the reader should hear it once.  It
#: fires saying which bound chose the size and naming
#: ``--point-extent-km`` and ``--polygon``, because on this bound the
#: card is no longer the lever (:func:`point_request_bound`).  A fetch
#: that spans the whole band keeps its own separate warning, which the
#: cap did not silence.
#:
#: It caps every fit that starts from a point -- :func:`fit_ladder` is
#: also the sizer behind ``woof domain-fit --point``, the starter
#: template's own door, at that template's own root dx -- and nothing
#: else.  A drawn area is sized to the drawing by
#: :func:`fit_polygon_ladder`, which never consults this number, so
#: asking for more ground than the cap is done by drawing it, with
#: ``woof domain --polygon``.
#:
#: The number is the DEFAULT of ``--point-extent-km`` on ``woof domain``
#: and ``woof domain-fit``, not a limit of the engine.  What the flag
#: cannot move is what keeps a point fit a valid domain: the projection's
#: polar envelope, one trip around the globe in longitude (a Mercator
#: root has no pole to stop it, so without this a large enough extent
#: wrapped the grid onto its own ground), the source's coverage and
#: one-crop bound, and the card (or, streamed, the tiling fit).  Nor can
#: it shrink a root below the smallest one its ladder hosts: an extent
#: under that gets the smallest root, and the plan summary says so

    a first-time reader learns that the hemisphere-wide fetch box they
    are about to download is a single flag away from something smaller.

    It used to open "sized to fill your card, not your map".  That
    asserted a CAUSE this function cannot see, and since 2.5.0 gave the
    fit a servable-crop bound the cause is sometimes false: on a large
    card the wizard now stops on the source and says so on stderr, and
    an advisory blaming the card two lines later contradicts it.  The
    sentence states what the thresholds above actually measure -- the
    box is much bigger than the documented examples -- and keeps the
    remedy, which is true either way.

    ``request_bound``, added in 2.7.3, is the other half of that same
    correction and the reason the sentence is not one string.  The point
    fit now stops on bounds the REQUEST carries rather than on the card
    (:func:`point_request_bound`), and on those the card-shaped remedy
    is not merely unhelpful, it is inert: with streaming on, the mode
    the desktop asks for, memory never binds at all, so every
    ``--vram-gib`` above the refusal floor emits the identical grid.
    Measured on the shipped 2.7.2 door's own argument shape, that was
    every mid-latitude point request -- the advisory fired at 30, 41.5,
    48.5 and 60 N and named a flag that changed nothing.  When a request
    bound is in force the sentence names ``--point-extent-km``, which is
    the direct way to ask a point for less ground, and ``--polygon``,
    which is how it asks for different ground; those are the levers
    that still move the answer.  When the fit sat on the smallest root
    its ladder hosts, neither of them can make it smaller, and the
    sentence names ``--root-dx`` instead.  It makes no claim about
    ``--vram-gib`` in that branch: a resident fit (``--tiles off``) on a
    small enough
    card is still bounded by memory below the extent cap, and saying
    otherwise would install the mirror image of the defect being fixed.

    Two things the first version got wrong, both found by a wheel user
    on Linux at ``--card 24gb --ladder 12``.  It measured longitude
    only, so a box 88 degrees tall passed unremarked; and its remedy
    named ``--card 12gb``, a tier not every platform runs, while saying
    nothing about the ``--area`` on the very fetch command printed two
    lines below -- the number a reader looks at when they wonder what
    this will cost them.  The sentence now names the box as the fetch
    box, and says why narrowing that flag alone is not the fix: the
    download exists to cover the domain, so the domain is what has to
    get smaller.

    the cycle, the lead, the run length, the cadence, the profile, and
    ``--statics-corridor`` on the hierarchy stage when the config

    have to produce by hand are gone.

    preparer as the cycle (it opens ``hrrr.tHHz.wrfnatfNN.grib2``), the
    hierarchy as the model start (it is compared to the namelist's
    start_time).  At lead 0 those are the same instant, which is why one

    A nest INHERITS its parent's radiation cadence.  Radiative transfer
    varies on cloud timescales, not on grid scales, so nothing about
    halving dx makes a shorter radiation interval more correct -- and
    WRF's own namelist guidance says so outright: set ``radt`` once for
    the coarsest domain and use the same value for every nest.

    Until 2.5.0 this was ``max(1.0, dx_km)`` per nest, which was wrong in
    both directions and expensive in one:

    * Under the 12-minute suites (every RRTMGP/RRTMG profile the wizard
      offers) the 12-3-1-0.5 ladder emitted 12/3/1/1 -- radiation once a
      simulated MINUTE on both sub-km rungs, measured at 79% of a real
      1 km run's wall clock.  The floor also flattened the bottom of the
      ladder: 1 km and 500 m were handed the same 1.0, so the refinement
      it was charging for had already stopped.  At the 250 m LES target
      this program exists for -- 12-3-1-0.5-0.25 -- it taxed three rungs
      out of five.
    * Under the ``radt = 1.0`` suites (the mp8 validation profile and the
      four no-radiation profiles) it ran the other way and emitted 3.0 on
      the 3 km nest: a CHILD calling radiation three times less often

    The ROOT's radiation/cumulus/diffusion cadences come from the shipped
    physics profile, so the emitted d01 satisfies the prepared-forecast
    runner's exact-equality guard at any --root-dx.  Nests keep the
    certified ladder's depth-varying ``diff_6th_factor``, never above
    their parent's (:func:`nest_diff6_factors`), and their pinned
    ``cu_physics = 0``: those two really are grid-scale decisions, and
    the multi-domain runner has no profile whitelist to stop them.

    ROOT ``cu_physics`` IS ONE OF THOSE GRID-SCALE DECISIONS TOO, below
    the convection-permitting bound.  Until 2.5.0 the root took the
    profile's cumulus switch at every spacing, so `--root-dx 3` emitted
    Kain-Fritsch on a grid that resolves its own deep convection, printed
    the sentence naming the heating and rainfall it therefore counts
    twice, and wrote the file anyway -- a defect the product diagnosed
    correctly and then shipped.  The default now follows the diagnosis:
    below :data:`CUMULUS_CONVECTION_PERMITTING_DX_KM` the root's cumulus
    scheme is OFF, and ``cudt_minutes`` goes to the registry's own
    spelling for a domain with no scheme to pace (0.0, as every
    ``cu_physics = 0`` template in :mod:`woof.physics_compat` carries).
    That bound is not a new number: it is the one
    :func:`cumulus_gray_zone_advisory` already judged the emission
    against, so the switch and its advisory read the same declaration.

    ``cumulus_requested`` is the user having NAMED the suite.  Naming
    ``--physics-profile`` asserts the config IS that shipped suite --
    :func:`woof.gfs_direct.front_door_physics_selection` enforces it
    switch for switch on both routes -- so a named suite is emitted
    verbatim at any spacing and keeps the advisory, which is the whole
    point of the advisory being advisory.  Per-domain ``cu_physics``
    stays overridable in the emitted TOML either way.

    ``radt`` is NOT one of them.  It is the root's, inherited by every
    nest (:func:`radt_ladder_minutes`) -- radiation varies on cloud
    timescales, not grid scales.  Refining it with dx is what the
    ``max(1.0, dx_km)`` rule did until 2.5.0, and it cost 79% of a
    measured 1 km run's wall clock for no science.

    EVERY domain, root and nest alike, gets the profile's ``epssm``.
    Until 2026-08-01 the nests were written ``epssm = 0.1`` while the
    root took 0.5 from the profile, and that one line was the whole of
    a reported nested-forecast blow-up: epssm is the vertical-acoustic
    off-centering coefficient, 0.1 is nearly centred, and the nest is
    exactly where the terrain is steepest -- a wizard 3 km -> 750 m
    ladder over the Cascades grew w from -15 to -289 to -976 m/s to
    non-finite in seven acoustic substeps at the steepest cell in the
    child (34.6 degrees; the 3 km parent smooths the same peak to 15.7
    and survives).  Setting the nest to the profile's 0.5 and changing
    nothing else ran both geometries clean for the full two hours.

    The 0.1 was not invented here -- it is WRF's Registry default, and
    it is what an IMPORTED namelist legitimately produces: ``epssm =
    0.5`` in a namelist.input assigns d01 only, so the shipped
    the reference case ladders carry 0.5/0.1/0.1/0.1 and are right to
    (:mod:`woof.namelist_import`, which reads the Registry column).
    The wizard is an author, not an importer, and copying an
    importer's per-domain tail is how the value got here.  Terrain-
    scaled epssm -- more off-centering where slopes are steepest -- is
    a real future refinement; it is deliberately NOT attempted here.
    Per-domain ``epssm`` stays overridable in the emitted TOML.

    twice.  Saying so once, in the file and on stdout, is the accurate
    thing; refusing would be wrong, and silence would be worse.

    default and the whole sentence under ``--explain``.  At most one

    * below ~4 km the dynamics resolve deep convection, so an active

      practice runs ``cu_physics = 0`` there.
    * in the 4-10 km band convection is neither fully subgrid nor well

      common operational practice, so the note is softer.

    ``cu_physics_by_domain`` is per-domain (outer to inner, same order
    as ``chain_km``) because cumulus is a per-domain switch here, not a

    Scale awareness is honoured per scheme, as this docstring always
    promised it would be.  Grell-Freitas (``cu_physics = 3``) carries
    its own ``sig = (1-frh)**2`` taper -- the parameterized contribution
    withdraws as dx approaches cloud-resolving spacing, which is the

    zone earns no advisory, and below 4 km it earns the SOFT sentence
    (the taper is the scheme's own answer there, but no ArWen-vs-WRF
    trajectory receipt backs it yet, so the wording says measured
    restraint rather than silence).  Classic KF (``cu_physics = 1``) is

    The card is not the only thing that decides how big a domain grown
    from a single point should be, and until 2.7.3 it was the only thing
    that did.  Two bounds, both properties of the REQUEST:

    * the projection's own usable envelope.  A Lambert or polar root
      grown far enough poleward swallows the projection pole, where
      lat-lon source interpolation and static-tile windowing do not work
      -- the limit :func:`_pole_clearance_refusal` states.  It is a
      SIZING bound here, not a refusal: the point is a legal request and
      shrinking the domain honours it, so the fit shrinks.  The refusal
      stays where a smaller domain cannot help -- a drawn area that
      itself reaches the pole, and a point so close to one that even the
      minimum layout contains it.

    * a maximum extent, ``max_extent_km`` (``--point-extent-km``,
      default :data:`POINT_FIT_MAX_EXTENT_KM`).  A point carries no
      extent at all, so "as much ground as this card can hold" is an
      answer to a question nobody asked; with streaming on it is not
      even bounded by the card.

    * one trip around the globe in longitude
      (:func:`woof.static.projection.footprint_longitude_span`).  The
      pole bound never fires on Mercator, and on the Lambert cones this
      wizard opens the band is crossed before the pole margin is reached.
      While the extent was fixed at 6,000 km neither could happen; once
      the extent became an argument, ``--point-extent-km 60000`` at the
      equator sized a 5000 x 4000 Mercator root running 540 degrees of
      longitude and the door printed PASS, and at 26 N a 2646 x 2116
      Lambert root running 407.  A root past this bound holds
      the same ground twice and integrates the two copies apart, so the
      fit shrinks to stay inside it.  A drawn area never reaches it: a
      polygon cannot describe more than one turn.

    Monotone in scale, which is what :func:`fit_ladder`'s bisection
    requires: growing a centered root moves its poleward edge further
    poleward and every axis further out, so a layout rejected here stays
    rejected at every larger scale.

    Module level rather than a closure inside the fit so the bounds can
    be asked about and tested on their own.  Only the fit calls it: what
    stopped the search is carried forward by ``fit_ladder``'s
    ``stop_out``, not re-derived, because the two consumers of that
    answer -- the plain fact the plan summary states and the flag the
    oversized-footprint advisory is allowed to name -- must agree with
    the search and with each other exactly, and a re-derivation off the
    emitted root misattributes a fit that stopped one discretisation

    signed convention, producing W > E for a crossing box (the
    ``woof fetch`` contract; NOMADS and CDS both consume it).  The
    latitude edges clamp to [-90, 90].  A footprint wider than 180
    degrees of longitude is refused unless the source explicitly supports
    a full-longitude band. That opt-in widens only the forcing coverage to

    width exceeds 180 degrees would be read back by
    :func:`woof.fetch.parse_area` as the complementary

    rather than refuse: by emission time the DOMAIN is already bounded
    by source coverage (the fit loop keeps every HRRR candidate's
    interpolation window inside the native grid), so what overruns here
    is only the margined lat/lon bbox -- a projection artifact of a
    Lambert footprint's curved edges plus the fetch margin, not data
    the preparation needs; for a coverage-boxed source ``--area`` is a
    coverage check, not a crop.  The field exhibit: a 1234 x 986 root
    at 3 km (39, -98) fits the HRRR grid with rows to spare, yet its
    margined bbox named 54.39 N -- north of anything HRRR carries --

    measured pool margin and the measured residue -- so the only thing
    left outside it is OTHER processes, which is exactly
    :data:`~woof.core.preflight.EXTERNAL_MARGIN_BYTES`.

    IT USED TO SUBTRACT THE ALLOCATION RESERVE, and the allocation

    compared against a budget from which its own CUDA context and its own
    backing store had ALREADY been removed: one process charged twice for
    the same bytes.  On a 10 GiB RTX 3080 that was 2.91 GiB of a 10 GiB
    card spent twice, and the hrrr ladder's SMALLEST layout -- 60x48 --
    was refused on a card that fits it (task 206; the acceptance walk is

    ``woof check``'s allocation gate at every grid size, so a wizard
    PASS remains a check PASS (``test_vram_measured_reserve.py::
    test_the_fit_gate_is_never_looser_than_the_allocation_gate``).

    A suite that is cheaper but still over the budget is not advice.
    Naming one sends the reader straight back into the refusal that
    named it: a small declared card refused a source's default suite at
    4.28 GiB against a 3.75 GiB budget, advised first a suite that
    prices 4.00 GiB at the same layout, and refused that one too.
    ``budget_bytes`` is the budget the refusal compared against, and a
    candidate is kept only when its envelope at the refused layout is
    within it.  That is the comparison that refused, so a suite named
    here is admitted at that layout.

    Ranked by the estimator's own peak envelope at the refused layout --
    ``price_bytes(profile_name) -> int | None`` -- never by a species
    heuristic.  The heuristic ranked by microphysics species and
    radiation presence, and on the 3080 walk it advised three
    legacy-RRTMG suites as "lighter" than the rte-rrtmgp default; the
    calibration runs then MEASURED the advised suite at 5.53 GiB against
    the default's 2.60 at the same 110x88 grid, because the legacy
    call-peak workspace dominates the envelope and the heuristic never
    priced it.  A candidate the pricer cannot price is dropped, not
    guessed at.

    Returned in the order a reader should try them -- cheapest last, so
    the first name is the smallest step down rather than the biggest
    sacrifice.

    Every candidate passes :func:`profile_route_blocker` -- the SAME
    pairing predicate the emission refuses by -- before it is priced,
    asked for the refused layout's own domain count, as the emission
    asks it.  Admissibility used to be checked for one hard-coded source only,
    so the 2.5.0 walk's gfs refusal ranked a RUC-LSM suite FIRST while
    the very same wizard refuses that pairing outright: following the
    printed advice was refused by the door that printed it.

    ``preferred`` is a suite to name first when it passes the same
    tests (the source's own default, when the refused suite is the
    door's default by grid spacing).  It rides in ``fitting`` like any
    other and is also returned alone, so the sentence can say what it is.

    Named in a refusal, never applied: a suite is the operator's choice
    and a wizard that silently downgraded physics to make a number fit
    would be lying about what it emitted.

    """Largest centered layout whose peak envelope fits the budget, with
    headroom left over.

    ``profile_at``, when given, maps a ladder's ratios to the suite that
    ladder binds.  The door passes it when the suite is its default, which
    is keyed on grid spacing (:data:`woof.physics_menu.SPACING_DEFAULTS`),
    so a shallower ladder offered as a way out of a memory refusal is
    priced with the suite it would run rather than this ladder's.

    ``point_extent_km`` is the largest root extent per axis the point
    request is sized to (``--point-extent-km``); see
    :func:`point_request_bound`.

    ``device_profile`` is the CARD the non-pool terms are priced against
    -- the one this machine MEASURED when no ``--card``/``--vram-gib``
    was declared, and ``None`` (the conservative reference) when the
    caller is sizing for a machine that is somewhere else.  It used to be
    ``None`` unconditionally, so a wizard that had just measured a 68-SM
    RTX 3080 priced that card's local-memory backing store on the 170-SM
    reference profile: 1.49 GiB of another card's shader count, on the
    one term shrinking the grid cannot move, while ``woof check`` on the
    same box used the live profile and disagreed (task 206, open task
    #162's mechanism).

    Bisects a continuous scale factor; every candidate is validated by the
    real experiment loader (clearance, cadence, ratio rules) and priced by
    the real estimator -- the wizard owns no memory arithmetic of its own.
    A custom ``--root-dx``/``--chain`` goes through this same loop, so a
    hand-specified ladder is validated and sized exactly like a preset.

    A template may supply dimensions_builder for its existing parent tree.
    The same hosting search, complete candidate validation, source bounds,
    and phase budget apply; the callback changes only proposed grid sizes.

    ``candidate_scales`` opts into a bounded, largest-first search instead
    of bisection. At most 64 strictly decreasing positive scales are allowed;
    the first fully admitted candidate wins. This avoids assuming monotonic
    tiling/host admission. It uses the SAME candidate, coverage, REQUEST
    and headroom checks, and retries only explicitly typed memory refusals.
    ``cancelled`` is a nonblocking predicate checked around expensive
    candidate operations.

    The request bounds are not optional on that road.  Both searches serve
    ``--point``, which carries no extent, so both have to be bounded by
    what a point may ask for (:func:`point_request_bound`) and both report
    what stopped them the same way, through ``stop_out``: one plain line of
    plan summary on stdout (:func:`point_fit_cap_note`), never a stderr
    warning, because a cap that fires on the ordinary request is not an
    abnormality.  A bounded search that skipped them would have grown a
    high-latitude cyclone request into the projection pole on a large card
    while the bisecting search shrank away from it -- the same door
    answering the same question two ways.

    Takes FREE VRAM, not a budget: the reserve is a property of the
    candidate experiment (see :func:`sizing_budget_bytes`), so it cannot
    be computed before the candidate exists.  And it stops short of the
    budget by :func:`fit_headroom_bytes` -- a config that exactly touches
    its budget is a config with nothing left for the machine to be
    slightly less generous than the model.

    ``stop_out``, when given, is filled with ``{"scope", "reason"}`` for
    the bound that actually stopped the search -- the one the tightest
    rejected candidate crossed -- and left EMPTY when memory stopped it.
    It exists so a caller can attribute the stall exactly rather than
    guessing at it: the first version of the point cap re-priced the
    emitted root one cell larger per axis and read the bound off that
    neighbour, which misattributes a fit that stopped one discretisation
    step under a cap.  The search already knows the answer; this hands
    it over instead of reconstructing it.

    It does NOT take :func:`fit_headroom_bytes` off the budget, and that
    asymmetry with :func:`fit_ladder` is deliberate.  That headroom is a
    property of a BISECTION: the point fitter grows the grid until the
    envelope touches the budget, so without it every emitted ladder
    landed a rounding error from the wall.  Here the polygon and its
    buffers determine the layout outright -- there is no loop to stop
    short in, and spending the headroom would refuse a user's explicit
    footprint that the enforced ``estimate <= budget`` gate accepts,
    which is a narrowing neither this fix nor the polygon route asked

    layout this accepts is a layout ``woof check`` accepts, and it names
