"""Give every local DA run a nowcast skill number, by default.

A local DA window ends with a short forecast and a folder of pictures.  What
it did not end with was an answer to the only question a user actually has:
how close was that forecast to the radar an hour later.  The engine already
held the referee -- masked neighbourhood FSS against the MRMS composite -- and
nothing connected it to a run.  This module is that connection.

What it does, whenever a window's forecast completes:

* reads the forecast's own composite reflectivity at each registered lead
  (15, 30, 45, 60 minutes after the analysis) the forecast actually reached;
* fetches the MRMS composite nearest each of those instants into a cache
  inside the case, so a rescore refetches nothing;
* scores model against radar, and radar-persistence against radar, on the
  identical cells, and records the difference;
* writes ``nowcast-score.json`` beside the window's own receipts, and hands
  back the compact per-lead rows the window receipt, the run receipt and the
  continuous status document all carry.

**The run is never at the mercy of the score.**  Every failure mode here is
recorded, not raised: no network, no front door, an archive that has not
published the scan yet, a lead whose valid time is still in the future.  A
forecast that ran is a forecast that completed, and a scoring problem that
failed the run would make the skill number cost more than it is worth.

**Latency is the normal case, not an error.**  At real time the 60 minute
lead cannot be scored until an hour after the analysis.  So a lead is left
``pending`` with its reason and the receipt is rewritten later: the continuous
controller rescores every earlier window as each new window completes, and
``woof local-da --score PLAN`` does the same on demand.

    An execution receipt records an absolute path, so a case that was copied
    to another box or another directory names a manifest that either is not
    there or -- worse -- is the ORIGINAL case's, still readable on the same
    machine. Scoring the original while claiming to score the copy is a wrong
    number that looks right, so a recorded path outside this case root yields
    to the manifest sitting inside it.
