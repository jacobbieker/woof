"""Fail-closed status for WRF physics suites that are being ported.

This module is intentionally small and declarative.  A WRF scheme number is
not an implementation: the namelist importer may only admit a scheme after
its state, setup, driver, CUDA implementation, restart/output contract, and
validation gates have all landed.  Until then, a request fails once with a
complete list of the missing coupled components instead of failing on the
first number or, worse, silently choosing a nearby scheme.

The source of truth for the requested bindings is WRF v4.6.1 commit
``d66e442fccc04111067e29274c9f9eaccc3cef28``.  Source anchors and the staged
acceptance gates live in ``docs/wrf_thompson_mynn_ruc_port.md`` and
``docs/wrf_nssl2_mp18_port.md``.

# The radiation-bearing MYNN family.
#
# Until 1.8.7 every shipped MYNN suite was one of the three rows above, and
# all three run shortwave with longwave OFF.  That pairing is a DAYTIME
# validation configuration -- ``nocturnal_radiation_refusal`` below refuses
# it at config load for any window containing local night, and
# docs/public/PHYSICS.md lists all three under "nocturnally valid: no" --
# so a user who chose MYNN from a menu landed in the nocturnally-invalid
# class with no MYNN alternative to move to.  Composing MYNN with radiation
# through a hand-written config was always accepted (there is no engine
# lock: bl_pbl_physics 5 and ra_lw/sw_physics 4/4 resolve and are preserved
# switch for switch); what did not exist was a NAMED suite, and a named
# suite is what every menu, every ``--physics-profile`` choice list and
# every route declaration is keyed by.
#
# WHICH RADIATION FAMILY.  woof serves the resolved 4/4 pair two ways
# (:data:`RRTMG_VARIANT_RTE_RRTMGP` and :data:`RRTMG_VARIANT_LEGACY`); these
# rows take RTE+RRTMGP, the family the comparable YSU peers take --
# :data:`MORRISON_PROFILE_ID` (the wizard's gfs/era5 default, and the
# profile the nocturnal refusal itself names as the remedy) and
# :data:`NSSL2_PROFILE_ID`.  Its registry option is 'supported', its
# coefficient tables ship as package data, and it is the ``ra_rrtmg_variant``
# default, so these rows sit beside those two without an asset-staging or
# ``require_rrtmg_legacy_ready`` step of their own.  The legacy port stays
# available to any config that names it; it is not what a menu default
# should hand someone.
#
# Each row below is its no-radiation sibling with the RADIATION BLOCK
# replaced and nothing else touched, so a paired run isolates radiation.
# ``radt`` is part of that block and moves 1.0 -> 12.0: every
# radiation-bearing suite this file ships runs 12.0, and calling RRTMG every
# simulated minute costs twelve times what the sibling's Dudhia call did for
# no forecast benefit.  The MYNN option identity (bl_mynn_*, icloud_bl,
# iz0tlnd) is NOT restated here, exactly as it is not restated by the
# no-radiation rows: those are RunConfig defaults validate_run_config pins
# unconditionally, and a profile that repeated them could drift from them.

# moved (microphysics wsm6-mp6 -> thompson-mp8) and nothing else, so a

#: Declared-experiment acknowledgement for running an asymmetric radiation
#: pairing (shortwave ON, longwave OFF) through a window that includes
#: local night.  Same governance idiom as the registry's expert-template
#: acknowledgements, delivered in the config itself
#: (``acknowledgements = [...]`` under ``[experiment]``) because the
#: refusal happens at config LOAD, before any front door's ``--ack``
#: flags are merged.
#:
#: Provenance (2026-08-06): a wizard-emitted 48 h real case bound
#: ``thompson-mp8-ysu-mm5-noah-validation-v1`` (ra_lw_physics 0,
#: ra_sw_physics 1).  Shortwave heated the surface by day; at night the
#: surface radiated with no downward longwave, skin temperature
#: cratered, the surface saturation humidity collapsed with it, and 2 m
#: dewpoints read in the 50s F inside a 70s airmass.  The pairing is a
#: legitimate DAYTIME validation configuration and stays selectable --
#: loudly, never silently.
ASYMMETRIC_RADIATION_NOCTURNAL_ACK = (
    "asymmetric-radiation-nocturnal-window-v1"
)


#: THE DECLARED CONSTANT downward longwave, in W m-2.  It is a number a
#: caller may TYPE.  It is not a measurement, it is not a scheme, and no
#: default hands it out.
#:
#: WHY IT IS DEFINED HERE and re-exported by :mod:`woof.core.physics`
#: rather than the other way round.  The two config-load refusals that
#: quote the number -- :func:`constant_longwave_refusal` and
#: :func:`radiation_off_land_surface_refusal` -- sit in this module beside
#: :data:`CONSTANT_DOWNWARD_LONGWAVE_ACK`, the token that declares it, and
#: a refusal must be able to state the number without importing a CUDA
#: engine to read it.  The standalone RW-WPS preprocessing wheel is where
#: that stopped being a preference: it stages ``woof/physics_compat.py``
#: and forbids ``woof/core/physics.py``, so the refusal that reached
#: upward for this constant raised ImportError instead of refusing, for
#: every user who hit it.  One number, one definition, owned by the layer
#: that can ship on its own.
#:
#: Provenance.  Through 1.8.7 this value was the ``glw=300.0`` DEFAULT of
#: :func:`woof.core.physics.initialize_physics`, and
#: ``woof/core/dudhia.py`` -- shortwave only -- returns
#: ``glw=fields["glw"]``, the array it was handed, echoed back untouched.
#: No production call site ever passed ``glw=``.  So every run with
#: ``ra_lw_physics = 0`` had a downward longwave of exactly 300.0 W m-2,
#: everywhere, for the whole forecast: a plausible-looking number that
#: never responded to temperature, humidity or cloud.  It produced a real
#: user report -- 2 m dewpoints collapsing tens of degrees below the
#: airmass over the Gulf warm sector overnight -- because radiative
#: equilibrium at 300 W m-2 is 269.7 K (25.8 F) while a Gulf-coast October
#: night runs near 410 W m-2, or 291.6 K (65.2 F).  A ~105 W m-2 nightly
#: deficit craters skin temperature, and surface saturation humidity
#: follows it down.
DECLARED_CONSTANT_GLW_WM2 = 300.0


#: Declared-experiment acknowledgement for integrating a real case whose
#: downward longwave is a CONSTANT rather than a computed flux.
#:
#: Distinct from :data:`ASYMMETRIC_RADIATION_NOCTURNAL_ACK` on purpose,
#: and the distinction is the point.  That token declares "I know this
#: window contains night"; it says nothing about where GLW comes from,
#: and because it is checked before any physics is inspected it lifted
#: the whole question.  Ten shipped configs carried it, including the two
#: files a new ERA5 or GFS user copies first, so copying one walked
#: straight past the guard into a frozen 300 W m-2 forecast.  A token
#: that lifts a nocturnal guard must not also lift a "this flux is
#: fabricated" guard: they are different claims, so they are different
#: tokens, and a config that means both says both.
#:
#: What it declares: every domain of this experiment that runs a
#: land-surface scheme with ``ra_lw_physics = 0`` will consume
#: :data:`DECLARED_CONSTANT_GLW_WM2` as its downward longwave for the
#: whole forecast, and the run receipt will say so.
CONSTANT_DOWNWARD_LONGWAVE_ACK = "constant-downward-longwave-v1"


#: The land-surface schemes that READ GLW every surface step, and are
#: therefore what turns an absent longwave scheme into a wrong forecast
#: rather than an unused buffer.  ``sf_surface_physics`` numbering.
#:
#: MEMBERSHIP IS NOT DECIDED HERE any more, only the display names are.
#: The fact "this scheme reads GLW" belongs to the scheme's own carrier
#: contract (``woof.core.radiation_carriers.CONSUMER_CARRIERS``, which
#: refuses a scheme it has no row for rather than defaulting it to "reads
#: nothing"); the registry builder derives every land-surface option's
#: ``consumers.reads_glw`` row from that contract, and
#: :func:`_require_agreement_with_the_registry` below holds this mapping's
#: keys equal to those rows at import.  So a future GLW-consuming LSM --
#: the Pleim-Xiu case -- cannot be registered, run and silently pass this
#: guard: it fails the import agreement until it appears here, and what it
#: needs here is a NAME, not a judgement.  The keys are not imported from
#: the contract directly because ``woof.config`` imports this module and
#: the contract imports ``woof.config``; the registry sits between them.

#: Declared-experiment acknowledgement for running a LAND-SURFACE MODEL

#: ``ra_sw_physics = 0``), which means nothing will ever compute the
#: downward longwave that model's energy budget reads.
#:
#: Provenance (2026-08-09).  The nocturnal guard above tests ``sw > 0 and
#: lw == 0``, so a suite with BOTH streams off slid past it, and
#: :func:`woof.core.physics.initialize_physics` attaches no radiation
#: adapter at all in that case (``radiation_active = bool(ra_lw_physics or
#: ra_sw_physics)``).  Noah (``woof/core/noah.py``), Noah-MP
#: (``woof/core/noahmp_runtime.py``) and RUC (``woof/core/ruc.py``) each
#: read ``fields["glw"]`` every surface step regardless, so the whole run's
#: downward longwave was the constructor's seed -- a plausible-looking
#: 300.0 that no scheme produced.  There is no seed any more:
#: :func:`woof.core.physics.initialize_physics` takes ``glw`` with NO
#: DEFAULT and refuses to invent one, so the number a land surface
#: integrates is always one somebody typed.  A surface budget with a
#: declared sky is still not a forecast, so a real case says so out loud
#: or does not run.
#:
#: THIS IS A DIFFERENT CLAIM FROM :data:`CONSTANT_DOWNWARD_LONGWAVE_ACK`,
#: and both are required of the configuration they overlap on -- both
#: radiation streams off, under a land-surface scheme.  This token says
#: "nothing computes my sky at all"; that one says "the downward longwave
#: my land surface integrates is a constant I declared".  Neither implies
#: the other: a shortwave-on run makes only the second claim, and the
#: second is what tells :func:`woof.runtime.declared_constant_glw` which
#: number to hand the engine.
#:
#: Same governance idiom and the same config-side delivery as
#: :data:`ASYMMETRIC_RADIATION_NOCTURNAL_ACK`, for the same reason: the
#: refusal happens at config LOAD, before any front door merges ``--ack``.

    against a sky that is not a computed quantity for the entire run.

    THE OMISSION CASE IS IN SCOPE AND SAYS SO.  Radiation resolves to off
    by DEFAULT, so a real configuration that simply never named a
    radiation selector is refused on exactly the same physics as one that
    spelled two zeros -- it is the larger class of the two, and it is the
    class that breaks previously-loading files.  ``declared_selectors``
    (from :func:`declared_radiation_selectors`, which reads the raw

    the file chose nothing, and the refusal reports the absent line
    instead of quoting back two zeros the author never wrote.  ``None``
    means the caller could not say, and takes the spelled wording,
    because claiming someone wrote nothing is a claim that needs
    evidence.  A file spelling only the legacy ``ra_physics = 0`` DID
    choose, and is told so -- which is what the three shipped declaring

    Unlike the nocturnal guard this asks nothing about the clock: a zero
    sky is wrong at noon as well as at midnight, so there is no window to
    scan and no reference point to need.  Delivering

    the refusal; silence does not.

# woof.physics_menu.source_soil_blocker asks the source's declared soil
# geometry the question RUC's soil ingest asks at preparation, so a RUC
# suite on a source that publishes one soil layer is refused before the

    both are resolved from the registry.

    RETIRED here, with the menu that replaced it: the R-068 citation for
    the one WSM6 + KF template on the aggregate RTE+RRTMGP option.  The
    menu is derived from the fixed-template routes' own declarations now,
    that template is declared on one of them, and its runtime product is
    resolved from the composition like every other row -- so there is no
    omission left to cite.

    RETIRED here, with the fix it waited on: the R-067 citation for the

    mp_physics=28 arm in woof/ingest/microphysics_cold_start.py.  The arm
