#: well as during integration.  A TABLE, not a per-source branch: adding a
#: source whose CPU road has been covered is one entry here and nothing
#: else.  Every source absent from it resolves an unrequested backend to
#: ``auto``, as the docstring below states: the door prices its
#: preparation and prepares on the card only when that price fits.
#:
#: ``met_em`` joins ``gfs`` because the met_em route already prepares one
#: domain and one forcing interval at a time and releases each
#: (``woof/metem_forecast.py`` per-interval ``del``/``gc.collect``), and
#: ``woof.ingest.real.initialize_real`` already accepts the resolved
#: backend, so its CPU road needs no new ingest code.

#: Why this policy prepares a host-tiled experiment on the CPU.  It travels
#: with the choice into the preparation receipt's ``selection`` block and
#: into the one line the preparation prints, so a CPU preparation the
#: reader did not ask for names the declaration that asked for it.

    Returns ``(backend, reason)``.  ``reason`` is :data:`HOST_TILED_CPU_REASON`
    when the host-tiling declaration, not the caller, chose the CPU, and
    ``None`` for every other answer.

    Unrequested and not host-tiled, the answer is ``auto`` (fixed means
    default): the door then prices its preparation and prepares on the
    card only when that price fits the card's free memory
    (:func:`woof.ingest.preprocess_backend.admit_preparation`).  It used
    to be ``cuda``, which is a request the fit may only refuse, never
    redirect.

    The [tiles] declaration already records that full-domain device residency
    is avoidable. The prepared road of every source in
    :data:`CPU_PREPARED_SOURCES` must make that true during preparation
    as well as during integration. Other sources resolve an unrequested
    backend to ``auto`` whatever ``[tiles]`` declares, until their CPU
    preparation route has been explicitly covered. ``auto`` is a request for
    the runtime resolver, never a CPU claim.

    ``tables`` serves the source CLI's already captured TOML authority without
    importing forecast code. ``experiment`` serves callers that validated it.
