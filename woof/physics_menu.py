"""Which physics suites each source can actually run, COMPUTED.

Owner design, 2026-08-20, verbatim: "why cant every model have multiple
unique working default".  Every registered source gets its own default
and its own set of shipped suites that actually run on it -- and both
are DERIVED from the admissibility rules that already refuse, never
transcribed into a table here.

THE FAILURE THIS CLOSES.  Driving the GUI, a suite that runs shortwave
with longwave OFF met a window with local night in it.  The wizard
refused, correctly, and its remedy named the gfs/era5 default -- a
Kain-Fritsch suite.  ``--source hrrr`` then refused THAT for
``cu_physics = 1``, because the native HRRR route's 3 km grid resolves
its own convection.  Two refusals, no way forward.  A remedy that leads
to the next refusal names nothing, so a remedy has to be picked from the
set the ACTIVE source's route admits, and that set has to exist as one
computed object rather than as a sentence written at each door.

The rules evaluated here are the ones that refuse elsewhere, called
through their own functions:

* :func:`woof.physics_compat.profile_route_blocker` -- the emission
  route's actual input-species requirements; source/template evidence membership
  does not restrict otherwise valid land-surface choices;
* :func:`source_soil_blocker` -- the soil the source publishes against the
  land surface's own soil ingest (RUC's nine-level remap), the question
  the preparation asks after the download;
* the nocturnal-validity class, which is the same predicate
  :func:`woof.domain_wizard.declared_nocturnal_night` and
  :func:`woof.physics_compat.nocturnal_radiation_refusal` test:
  shortwave on with longwave off;
* the component-owned vertical level bounds
  :func:`woof.physics_compat.validate_resolved_physics_vertical_levels`
  aggregates -- the gate that used to green-light nz=130 under YSU;
* the physics registry's own template maturity.

NOTHING HERE BRANCHES ON A SOURCE ID OR A PROFILE ID.  Both axes are
read from the doors that own them -- ``source_adapters()`` and
``WIZARD_PHYSICS_PROFILES`` -- so a model registered tomorrow and a
suite registered tomorrow both appear, correctly classified, with no
edit here.  ``tests/test_physics_menu.py`` grafts one of each to prove
it.

Every import below is deliberately inside a function: the wizard
imports this module's callers, and a module-level import would close
that loop.

TWO of them still name :mod:`woof.domain_wizard`, and both are for its
PROSE -- ``physics_summary`` in :func:`profile_facts` and
``_radiation_words`` in :func:`nocturnal_remedy`.  The tables and the
pairing predicate moved to :mod:`woof.physics_compat` on 2026-08-20,
because :func:`woof.physics_compat.nocturnal_radiation_refusal` reaches
:func:`universally_admissible_profile` at the one experiment load every
front door shares, and a preparation-only install has no wizard: while
the predicate lived behind the door, that refusal raised ImportError in
the standalone RW-WPS wheel instead of refusing.  The two prose reaches
are safe there because their only callers are the wizard itself
(``domain_wizard.py``) and ``woof run-plan --physics-profiles``
(``runplan.py``), neither of which that wheel stages.

#: The level count each component's vertical bound is ASKED at.
#:
#: The bounds themselves are level-count-independent declarations, but
#: the aggregating preflight is a validator -- it takes a grid and says
#: yes or no -- so the menu asks it about a grid every shipped component
#: accepts and reads the bounds off the checks it reports.  40 is the
#: certified Grell-Freitas fixture's level count and sits inside every
#: shipped component's declared range, so no violation is raised and
#: every check is reported.  A component whose floor rose above this
#: would drop out of the reported checks rather than lie, which is why
#: :func:`vertical_levels` reports what it read rather than asserting a
#: count.
_BOUND_PROBE_LEVELS = 40


#: The profiles the prepared single-domain forecast runner accepts, in
#: the order the doors list them.
#:
#: THE ORDER CARRIES MEANING: the nocturnally valid suites come first, so
#: :func:`default_profile_for` taking the head of an admissible set gets
#: both radiation streams without knowing what "nocturnal" means.  The
#: cumulus-off Thompson suites and the P3 composition are the only
#: full-radiation suites the nested HRRR route's physics gate admits --
#: every other 4/4 profile carries ``cu_physics = 1``, which that route
#: refuses because its 3 km grid is convection permitting -- so a list
#: without them could only default that route to a
#: shortwave-on/longwave-off suite.  P3 sits AFTER them deliberately:
#: the head of the HRRR-admissible set is what a source with no adapter
#: recommendation inherits, so it has to be the arm the product
#: defaults to; P3 is chosen, never inherited.
#:
#: The RTE+RRTMGP Thompson suite therefore leads its legacy twin, which
#: it did not until the modern radiation arm became the default on every
#: route (owner ruling, 2026-09-19).  While the legacy twin led, a
#: source whose adapter named no recommendation would have inherited the
#: legacy engines from this order alone, which is the opposite of that
#: ruling.  ``--source hrrr`` never read it either way: that adapter's
#: own recommendation binds its answer.
#:
#: IT LIVES HERE, not in the wizard door that used to own it, and the
#: reason is a wheel: :func:`woof.physics_compat.nocturnal_radiation_refusal`
#: reaches :func:`universally_admissible_profile` below at the one
#: experiment load every front door shares, INCLUDING the preparation-only
#: ones.  While the list and the pairing predicate sat in
#: :mod:`woof.domain_wizard`, that made the refusal reach the wizard,
#: which the standalone RW-WPS preprocessing wheel does not stage (it pulls
#: the memory preflight and ``woof.cli``) -- so that wheel raised
#: ImportError where a refusal belonged, and
#: ``tools/build_rw_wps_release.py`` refused to stage rather than ship it.
#: The wizard imports both names from here and re-exports them under the
#: spellings every reader in the tree already uses.
#: The RANKING, not the membership (audit R-067).  Membership is derived
#: from the registry below, so a registered template can never be left
#: without a wizard row; this tuple says which suites lead, and the
#: paragraph above says why that order is the thing being compared.
