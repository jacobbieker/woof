"""What physics WOOF can run, what each choice means, and whether a mix runs.

One engine-owned answer for every front end (``woof physics-catalog``,
``GET /api/physics`` and ``POST /api/physics/check`` in ``woof gui``, and
an assistant that composes a forecast for someone):

* :func:`catalog` lists every family and every scheme the registry has,
  with a plain one-line description, its cost against the default suite,
  where it is valid (grid spacing, vertical levels, card size), the named
  suites that carry it, and the presets by intention.
* :func:`check` takes any combination and answers valid, or the refusal
  of the engine door that stopped it, word for word, with the nearest
  combinations the same doors admit.

Nothing here is a second rule table.  The schemes, couplings, maturity
and suites are read from ``physics_registry_v2.json``; a combination is
judged by building a :class:`woof.config.RunConfig` and passing it
through the doors a real run passes through
(:func:`woof.config.validate_run_config`,
:func:`woof.physics_compat.validate_physics_capabilities`, the
radiation-off land-surface refusal and the source route's emission gate);
cost comes from the measured step rates in :mod:`woof.core.pace` and says
"unmeasured" where no measurement exists; grid-spacing advice is the
wizard's own gray-zone sentences sampled on a ladder of spacings.

The only words written here live in ``physics_catalog_v1.json``: one
description per scheme and the presets.  A new scheme is one description
row; a new preset is one row naming a registered suite.
