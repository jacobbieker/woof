"""Shared seam for woof's cycling spine: schemas, ticks, refusals.

Three producers build the spine in parallel; this module is the one place
their vocabularies meet.  It carries schema strings, the tick type, and
the refusal base class -- no model state, no I/O, no cupy.  It is safe to
import from a receipt reader, from a test, and from a process that will
never open a GPU.

The tick is one millisecond of MODEL time.  Every time in the cycling
system is an integer number of ticks since the epoch anchor, and the
epoch anchor is the only ``datetime`` in the spine.  A dt that is not a
whole number of milliseconds is refused by name rather than rounded,
because a rounded dt is how a child drifts from its parent over a long
cycle with nothing reporting it.
