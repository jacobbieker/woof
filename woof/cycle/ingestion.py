"""Did the analysis actually land, or did the cycle quietly drop it?

Those two outcomes look identical from outside: both produce a forecast,
both produce receipts, both run to completion.  The only difference is
that one of them is assimilating radar and the other is a very expensive
free forecast wearing a DA cycle's clothes.  This module is what tells
them apart, and it does it with three hashes taken at three different
places by two different processes:

1. ``background_sha256`` -- the parent state the SPINE wrote into the
   anchor, hashed by the spine.
2. the increment itself -- its sha, its nonzero cell count, and a per
   field L2, so a refusal can say what was thrown away.
3. ``analysis_sha256`` -- the state after application, hashed by the
   FORECAST process off its own rehydrated device state, downloaded to
   host.  Taken anywhere else it proves nothing: the interesting failure
   is precisely that the increment never reached the device.

**Both directions are gated, because an exact-zero delta means the
experiment never ran.**  A nonzero increment that leaves the state
bit-identical is a dropped analysis.  A zero increment that changes the
state means rehydration itself is perturbing the atmosphere, which is a
different and worse bug wearing the same clothes.  Neither is allowed to
pass silently, and both arms are exercised in the tests.
