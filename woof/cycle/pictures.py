"""Each boundary a cycle completes, written as a frame and drawn as it lands.

THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES: ``woof cycle`` drew no picture at any point of a
run.  Its parent engines publish anchors (``anchors/``), which are the
state a cycle resumes from and not a history frame, and nothing under
``woof/cycle/`` wrote a wrfout or raised the landing hook the other
routes draw from.  The 2.7.5 to 2.7.7 notes carried it as a known limit
with no reason beyond that.  Every other route that writes history draws
each frame as it lands (:mod:`woof.live_products`); this is the same
drawing for the cycle.

What a boundary becomes
-----------------------
A frame is written only where the parent can be placed on the Earth: the
parent's planes must sit on a latitude/longitude grid, taken, first match
wins, from

1. the parent's own ``XLAT``/``XLONG`` planes (a recorded series that
   carries its coordinates beside its fields),
2. ``--parent-geo-file``,
3. the first ``--placement-obs-file``, whose radar grid IS the target
   model grid by its own contract.

Every 2-D plane the boundary carries on that grid goes into
``wrfout/wrfout_d01_<valid time>`` through
:func:`woof.io.surface_wrfout.write_surface_wrfout`, the writer the other
two lanes whose forecasts are 2-D snapshots already use; the parent's
``composite_reflectivity`` becomes the frame's reflectivity, so the
renderer draws the composite the parent carried.  Nothing the parent does
not carry is drawn: the writer adds only what the renderer needs to open
the file (a zero one-level ``T`` and the unrotated-grid pair, neither
drawn as a picture), never a zero terrain or column mass that would be
drawn as a 0 m Terrain Height map.  The frame is moved onto
its name only once it is complete, then handed to the same
:class:`woof.live_products.LiveProducts` every other route uses, which
draws it into ``png/`` while the next leg runs.  When the cycle ends the
shared finalize stage (:func:`woof.go_cli._render_stage`) draws only
the frames that drawing could not prove it published.

What is not drawn, and why
--------------------------
A parent on an MPAS mesh (a boundary stamped ``mpas-cuda`` or
``mpas-cuda-frames``, which is what every model parent the door runs
through the port's bridge comes back as, or a replayed MPAS series)
publishes cell arrays (``rho`` is ``(nCells, nLevels)``), and its anchor
carries no cell coordinates, so no plane of it can be placed on a map;
such a run says so in one line and draws nothing.  A replayed parent
whose planes are on a grid but that names no coordinates for it says
which flag supplies them.

Telemetry never fails a cycle: every failure here is a line on stderr
and a ``warning`` event, and the anchors, receipts and ledger are
written exactly as before.
