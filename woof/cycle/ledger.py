"""The cycling spine's control plane: an append-only ledger of transitions.

Crash recovery is a replay of this file, so it is written the way
:mod:`woof.ensemble.cycle` publishes an analysis -- declare, fsync,
then rename -- because that is the one place in this program that
already gets atomicity right.

Three phases, per record:

  1. the record is serialised into ``cycle_ledger.jsonl.staged`` and
     fsynced, so the bytes exist on the platter before anything claims
     they do;
  2. the staged line is appended to the live log and the log is fsynced;
  3. the staged file is removed.

A crash between 1 and 2 leaves a staged file; :meth:`CycleLedger.settle`
rolls it forward, because the staged bytes were proved before phase two
began.  A crash between 2 and 3 leaves a staged file whose ``seq`` is
already live; settle drops it rather than double-counting.  Rolling
forward is safe in both directions and neither is a guess.

**Reading a directory listing, or the JSONL itself, to discover a
cycle's state is OUT OF CONTRACT.** :meth:`CycleLedger.settle` is the
only supported reader: it settles any in-flight publication first, and a
raw read cannot, so a raw reader sees a half-published ledger and takes
it for a whole one.
