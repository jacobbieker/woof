"""The cycling spine's state machine.

The supervisor owns one cycle boundary at a time and nothing else.  It
advances the parent, proves the clock is ARMED, offers the analysis a
chance to land, verifies the analysis was actually eaten, replans the
children, advances them, writes a receipt, and appends the transition.
Every one of those steps is an injected callable, so the whole machine
is testable with no GPU, no model and no NetCDF -- which is the point:
the failure policy is where a cycling run lives or dies, and a policy
you can only exercise by running a forecast is a policy nobody tests.

The deliberate asymmetry, stated once here because it governs
everything below: **a child may die without killing the cycle; the
parent may not.**  That is what makes unattended arbitrary child
spawning safe -- a bad placement or a blown-up 500 m child costs one
slot, not the run.
