"""The anchor: one cycle boundary, on disk, in a versioned format.

The artifact this replaces is ``pickle.dump(HostDriverCheckpoint,
protocol=4)`` of live host objects.  That is a fine cache and a terrible
contract: only one Python family can read it, it does not survive a numpy
version change, it cannot be diffed, and a DA engine written in Rust --
or the renderer, or a receipt reader on another box -- cannot open it at
all.  The cycling spine needs the opposite of that, because the spine is
a SEPARATE PROCESS from both the dycore and the assimilator.  The MPAS
port pins woof by SHA and re-verifies the checkout before and after
every run, so the spine cannot be a library the port imports.  What
crosses that boundary is files.

An anchor is therefore a directory, self-describing, hashed, and
committed atomically:

    <root>/anchors/anchor_<cycle:03d>_<YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS>/
      anchor.json              the manifest (:data:`ANCHOR_SCHEMA`)
      parent_prognostic.nc     rho, rho_theta, rho_u, rho_w, scalars,
                               time_seconds
      parent_derived.nc        exner and the rest of the carried
                               diagnostics -- NON-authoritative, stamped
                               with the prognostic sha they came from
      parent_seam.nc           the physics-seam mapping (optional)
      analysis_increment.nc    the DA increment in the anchor's own space
                               (optional)
      children/<grid_id>/state.nc
      COMMIT                   phase-two marker: every file with its sha

**The derived block is stamped, and that stamp is the whole point.**  A
DA increment rewrites ``rho``/``rho_theta``; the diagnostics carried
beside them then describe the pre-analysis atmosphere.  The model will
integrate that state happily and be wrong.  Every pre-existing gate on
the restart path is an IDENTITY gate -- does the restored state equal the
saved one -- and an increment must break identity by construction, so no
existing gate can see it.  :func:`woof.cycle.consistency.derived_is_stale`
reads the stamp this module writes; that is the guard.

**Three-phase commit, borrowed from the one place in this program that
already gets atomicity right** (``woof/ensemble/cycle.py``): everything
is written into ``anchor_...tmp/`` and fsynced; a ``COMMIT`` marker
naming every file with its sha256 is written and fsynced; only then is
the directory renamed into place.  A crash leaves a ``...tmp`` directory
that :func:`read_anchor` refuses by name -- never a half anchor that
reads like a whole one.

**Reading a directory listing to discover anchors is out of contract.**
Use :func:`latest_anchor` and :func:`anchor_for_cycle`; they only ever
return committed anchors.

    parent is a level-major box".  The port's own
    :class:`PrognosticState` is indeed level-major -- ``(nVertLevels,
    nCells)`` -- but a state extracted from a history file is
    cell-major, and the same code then published ``n_levels: 40962,

    the hashes, the ingestion gate and the arming triple are all
    shape-agnostic -- but every future reader of that manifest was told
    three lies.

    The determination is made from the data and is not a convention:
    ``rho_w`` lives on interfaces, so it exceeds ``rho`` by exactly one
    along the VERTICAL axis and matches it along the entity axis.  That
    identifies the vertical axis with no ambiguity at any real mesh.
    ``rho_u`` then shares the vertical extent and carries edges on the
    other axis.  When the arrays do not support the determination the
    manifest says ``layout: "indeterminate"`` and leaves the counts
    ``None`` -- an absent number a reader can see beats a confident
    wrong one.
