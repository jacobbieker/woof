"""The spine's side of the bridge: launch a forecast, read a segment.

The cycling spine cannot run the MPAS GPU port in its own process.  The
port pins woof by commit and loads it from a frozen Arwen checkout, and
refuses if woof is already live from another tree -- and ``woof.cycle``
IS woof.  So the forecast runs in a process of its own, launched from
here, and **the anchor on disk is the only channel between them**.

The channel, stated exactly, because "the anchor is the channel" is the
kind of sentence that quietly stops being true:

* IN: the worker is handed one committed anchor directory.  It reads the
  parent prognostics, the saved-diagnostics sidecar, the physics
  backend's restart payload from the anchor's seam slot, and the
  analysis increment -- all of it from that directory, all of it in the
  anchor's own array format.  Nothing else about the previous cycle
  reaches it.
* OUT: the worker writes a *segment* -- the same array format, plus a
  JSON receipt of what it did.  The spine reads that, grades the
  evidence, and seals it into the next anchor with :func:`write_anchor`,
  which is where the refusals and the parent-kind stamp live.
* Never: a pickle, a shared object, a live import.

A segment is deliberately not an anchor.  The stamp on an anchor is a
claim about evidence (``mpas-cuda`` means the analysis genuinely
re-entered the dycore), and the process that produced the evidence
should not be the process that grades it.  :func:`stamp_for_segment`
grades it, on this side.

The import constraint is enforced structurally in four places, not by
convention:

1. ``mpas_cycle_bridge`` contains no woof import anywhere, and
   :func:`verify_bridge_purity` proves that by parsing the package's own
   syntax trees.  A test calls it; a contributor who adds one turns that
   test red.
2. The worker installs an import guard on ``sys.meta_path`` that refuses
   ``woof.cycle`` by name, always, and ``woof`` itself until the
   port's pinned checkout has been declared.
3. :func:`launch` builds the child environment with ``PYTHONSAFEPATH=1``
   and strips ``PYTHONPATH``, so the spine tree is not on the child's
   import path at all; the worker adds the repository root only long
   enough to import the bridge, then removes it again.
4. The worker records where ``woof`` actually came from in its segment
   receipt, so every run carries the evidence that the constraint held
   rather than the assertion that it does.
