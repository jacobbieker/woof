"""Child domains across a cycle boundary: re-place, retire, reclaim.

**A child cannot be allocated mid-run on this line, and that is a design
decision, not a gap.**  :func:`woof.experiment.active_experiment` refuses
any grid_id that was not declared dormant, :func:`build_experiment` prices
the whole experiment at t=0, and :func:`woof.core.clock.build_schedule`
bakes activation ticks into precomputed op tables.  The result is that a
spawn is an ACTIVATION of a reservation rather than an allocation that can
OOM after three hours of integration, and VRAM is deterministic from the
first second of the run.  Fighting that is an allocator project.

So this module makes the RESERVATION the fixed thing and the PLACEMENT the
arbitrary thing, and uses the cycle boundary as the allocation point --
which is free, because a cycle boundary is already a process boundary.

    within a cycle    spawn is activation of a pre-declared dormant slot,
                      through unchanged 2.3.0 machinery
    across cycles     the placement plan is recomputed from the analysis;
                      a live child is re-declared at its moved placement
                      and restored from its anchor, a child whose storm
                      died is RETIRED and its slot returns to the pool,
                      and a new storm claims a free slot

The accurate cost, stated here because it is the one thing a user must know
before choosing ``--child-slots N``: **N slots cost N nests' worth of VRAM
for the whole run, filled or not.**  That is what buys determinism.

**A child may die; the cycle may not.**  :func:`run_child_leg` catches a
child's divergence and returns ``DIVERGED`` with the field, the cell and
the value.  It does not re-raise.  That asymmetry is what makes unattended
arbitrary spawning safe: a bad placement or a blown-up 500 m child costs
one slot, not the run.  It does NOT catch failures that are not the
child's -- an allocator error is the run's problem and propagates.

No case names, no station names (standing owner rule).
