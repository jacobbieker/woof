"""The integration seam: bind the spine's injected callables to real modules.

Three lanes built the cycle in parallel against a shared contracts module.
Two seams did not meet, and this module is where they are joined:

1. ``woof.cycle.cli`` imports ``build_placement_provider(kind=...,
   child_slots=..., allow_clamp=...)`` from ``woof.cycle.placement`` and
   refuses by name if it is absent.  The placement lane shipped the three
   provider CLASSES and a keyword-only ``plan_children`` that takes a
   ``SlotPool``, but never that factory.  Nothing was wrong with either
   half; they simply never met.

2. The spine's ``advance_parent`` returned ticks and nothing else, so the
   CLI cycled a clock over an empty root: no anchor was written, the
   three-hash ingestion gate never ran and the hydrostatic instrument
   never fired.  Every one of those exists in the anchor lane.  The
   parent engine here is what makes a cycle actually land on disk.

The adapters keep the supervisor's contract exactly as the spine lane
documented it: ``advance_parent(cycle_index, anchor_in) -> {...}`` with
``parent_ticks``/``anchor_ticks`` integers, and ``plan_children(
cycle_index, parent_record) -> [records]`` carrying geographic keys.
