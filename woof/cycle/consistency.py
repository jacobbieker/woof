"""Is this state in agreement with its own carried diagnostics?

Every gate that already stands on the restart path is an IDENTITY gate:
it asks whether the state that came back equals the state that went in.
A DA increment must break identity by construction -- that is what an
analysis IS -- so not one of those gates can see the failure this module
exists for: prognostics rewritten by an increment, diagnostics carried
across the boundary unchanged, and a model that resumes integrating a
state whose ``exner`` describes the atmosphere it had BEFORE the radar
spoke.  It will not crash.  It will be wrong.

So the instrument here is POSITIVE rather than an identity check.  It
recomputes exner from ``rho_theta`` through the equation of state and
asks how far the carried exner has drifted from the recomputation.

**The equation of state is the PORT's, not a textbook's.**  This is not
a stylistic preference; the first version of this module got it wrong
and halted a correct closed loop.  The port's ``cuda_backend.recovery``
(package ``woof.hex``, ``mpas_port`` before the port's 0.2.0 rename)
carries the only authority::

    theta = rtheta / rho;
    const T argument = zz * (rgas / p0) * rtheta;
    exner = mp_pow<T>(argument, rgas / (cp - rgas));
    pressure = zz * rgas * rtheta * exner;

Two things follow, and both were originally missed:

``zz`` is IN the argument.
    The port's prognostic mass variable is ``rho_zz`` (``state.rho``)
    and its mass-weighted potential temperature is ``rho_zz * theta_m``
    (``state.rho_theta``); ``zz = dzw / dz`` is the vertical metric
    (the port's ``vertical``).  Recomputing exner from ``rho_theta``
    alone leaves out ``zz`` entirely, and since exner is a power law the
    omission shows up as a departure of exactly ``|zz**(rd/cv) - 1|``.
    On the x1.40962 mesh ``zz`` runs 0.83 to 2.35, which puts that
    departure at 0.407 -- an instrument reading five orders of magnitude
    above the gate, produced by a state that was never wrong.

``rho_theta`` is already MOIST and takes no further correction.
    The port's own recovery names its ``rtheta / rho`` output
    ``theta_m``.  The moisture is inside the prognostic, and the EOS
    consumes ``rtheta`` directly.  Multiplying in another
    ``(1 + Rv/Rd q)`` here would be a second bug wearing the first one's
    clothes.

**It is validated in both directions and it reports its own resolution
floor, always.**  A residual instrument with no floor is how a threshold
gets tuned below the noise and a gate becomes decoration.  The floor is
MEASURED, and it is measured against the precision of the state actually
being graded rather than against the precision of this module's own
arithmetic.  That distinction is the module's second original defect: a
float64 recomputation differenced against itself always reports ~1e-16,
which is true about numpy and false about the instrument.  A port
boundary carries float32 ``exner``, and a float32 exner simply cannot be
pinned closer than its own representation granularity no matter how
exactly the physics agrees.  So the floor combines the granularity of
the carried field with the measured sensitivity of the recomputation to
one ulp of its inputs, and on a real port boundary it lands near 2e-7 --
not 2e-16.

The threshold below is unchanged, and deliberately so.  It sits above
the float32 floor and three orders below the smallest departure anybody
would call an analysis; the accurate statement of its margin is in the
constant's own note.
