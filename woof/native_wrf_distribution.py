"""Distribution contract and fail-closed runtime check for native WRF input.

The dedicated ``rw-wps`` wheel contains preprocessing/export modules and the
installed HRRR orchestration helpers, not woof's forecast executor.  A
versioned Linux or Windows runtime bundle supplies the platform Rust bridges
and a launcher.  Source GRIBs, static geography, namelists, and stock ``wrf.exe``
remain explicit, hash-bound case inputs rather than package data.

    """One executable the standalone rw-wps bundle carries, declared once.

    Everything a builder needs about a bridge is on the row: the cargo
    workspace that produces it, the option that names an already-built
    copy, the environment variable the installed launcher binds it to,
    the no-argument usage marker its identity probe demands, and the
    route that refuses without it.

    THE ROW IS THE WHOLE DECLARATION, because the shape it replaces cost
    a release.  A bridge used to be a name in a tuple plus a hand-written
    ``parser.add_argument`` plus a hand-written entry in each builder's
    ``bridge_inputs`` dict plus a hand-written ``export`` in each
    launcher -- five places, none of which any test held together.  Two
    of the five went stale: ``tools/build_rw_wps_release.py`` never
    passed ``rw_fetch`` at all, so the standalone release builder raised
    ``AttributeError`` before staging a byte, and both launchers bound
    five of the six bridges.  Then 2.7.5 added ``gdt101_remap`` to the
    bridge bundle for ICON global and the standalone bundle silently did
    not grow it, which shipped as a known limit with ``woof doctor``
    naming the gap.

    A new bridge is now one row.  Nothing else in this file or in either
    builder is written per bridge, and
    ``tests/test_native_wrf_distribution.py`` fails when a row and the
    surfaces that must honour it disagree.
