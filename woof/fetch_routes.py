"""The one acquisition engine every table-driven fetch route runs through.

``woof fetch --source`` used to accept four names.  Ten sources had a
runnable packaged profile, a passing 6 h forecast and no way to get their
bytes -- the RRFS arm's 6.3 GiB came down by hand-written ``curl``.  A
capability with no front door is engine-proven, not shipped.

This module closes that, and it closes it as TABLE WORK.  Everything
model-shaped -- which host publishes the bytes, what the key looks like,
which cycles the producer runs, how far each one forecasts and at what
spacing, which downloaded objects are the primaries and which are the
composition's supplement or its cross-source donor -- is rows in the
packaged document ``authorities/rw-wps-fetch-routes.v1.json``.  Nothing
here branches on a model name.  Adding ICON-D2, RAP-AK or a hires Euro
model is a row in that file; if it ever needs a function in this one, the
row grammar was wrong.

Three stages, in order:

* **resolve** -- :func:`resolve_request` turns ``--cycle/--hours`` into an
  ordered, deterministic object list with no network at all, so every
  refusal a request has coming (a cycle the producer does not run, a lead
  past the horizon, a member outside the declared set) is paid for in
  milliseconds rather than after a download.
* **transfer** -- :func:`run_plan` moves the objects through
  :mod:`woof.fetch_pool`, so every table route is parallel by default with
  the same bounded, host-capped, in-order-admission semantics the GFS and
  HRRR routes already have.
* **compose** -- the declared per-lead concatenations (GEFS's disjoint
  ``pgrb2a``+``pgrb2b`` pair, GDPS's one-message-per-file valid time) run
  after the bytes land and verify, producing the exact files
  ``woof prep`` consumes.

The output directory is then a front door, not a pile: it carries the
ordered ``--input-list``, the supplement bindings the composition
declares, ``SHA256SUMS``, and a ``prep-command.txt`` whose bound half runs
as printed.

    Every file rides :mod:`woof.fetch_pool`, so a table route is

    Completed objects get individual recovery receipts even after an
    earlier object fails. The preparation manifest is published only
    when the whole request completes.

    ``probe`` is the availability question the transfer host is chosen
    with -- ``url -> bool``, defaulting to one governed HEAD.  It runs
    ahead of the transfers, through the same pool, and only for the
    objects this run has still to download.

    The as-posted fetch (``woof fetch --as-posted``, DESIGN A136 2.3)
    passes two hooks.  ``lead_gate`` is called with an object's lead
    group before it moves and blocks until one host holds that whole
    lead, returning the rung that does (which then heads the object's
    ladder); it raises when the lead passes its late time, and its
    ``refetch(lead, error)`` is asked when a transfer did not verify, to
    wait a round and name the rung to fetch it from again.  The ahead
    probe is not run under it: it would ask hosts about leads not yet
    due.  ``on_lead(lead, entries, composed)`` fires in lead order once
    every object of a lead group is admitted, after that lead's
    composition and after the manifest is republished for the verified
    prefix with ``complete: false``; the last manifest says
    ``complete: true``.  Without the hooks nothing here changes.
