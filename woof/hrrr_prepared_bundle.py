"""Publish the portable authorities a prepared HRRR bundle needs.

The native HRRR preparation has always produced a complete, certified
prepared case: a prepared cache in the shared format, a native static
cache, a geometry receipt, a sealed decoder bridge manifest, and a
stock-WRF export the project has run WRF from.  What it never produced
is the small set of PORTABLE authorities
:func:`woof.prepared_single_domain_forecast.preflight_prepared_forecast`
re-derives at its front door -- a ``proof.json``, a role-keyed source
manifest, and the experiment config those two are bound to.  Without
them an HRRR case is runnable by the native benchmark and by nothing
else, which is why the cycling DA driver could not start from one.

This module writes exactly those three, from the values the preparation
already computed, and nothing else.  It renames no existing artifact and
recomputes no science: every digest it records is taken from a file the
preparation wrote, and the experiment config it publishes is rendered
from the tables the preparation itself handed ``build_experiment`` and
verified to reload to the same prepared-domain identity
(:mod:`woof.experiment_document`).

The reader for these documents lives in
:mod:`woof.prepared_single_domain_forecast`; the two are held together
by tests that publish with this writer and admit with that reader,
rather than by two hand-matched spellings of one schema.
