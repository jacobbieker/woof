"""Generic real-case experiment runtime.

The prepare -> static -> ingest -> initialize -> integrate -> output
pipeline for the experiment path, single-domain in this task (the
multi-domain tree/schedule executor is Task 14).  Every operation here
is a pure extraction of the frozen reference-case machinery: identical
operations in identical order on identical values, with the formerly
implicit constants (bundle paths, the case start time, the eta-level
table, the forcing-coverage ceiling, ``sfcp_to_sfcp``, the trace-gas
override, the output identity) replaced by :class:`ExperimentConfig` /
:class:`CaseDataConfig` values.  Operation order and operand identity stay
stable so frozen verification profiles remain byte-inert.

Layering: this module never imports case profile modules; the frozen
reference profile imports *this* module and feeds it the frozen pinned
values.  Grid construction still consumes a declared WPS namelist
for GEOG resolution selection only; Lambert geometry comes directly from
the experiment's ``ProjectionConfig`` and registered nest layout.

Equivalence notes (the argument the A/B gate checks empirically):

- The experiment path runs each per-domain :class:`RunConfig` exactly as
  the loader built it, with ``clock_dt = 0.0`` (retired, architecture
  section C).  Every ``clock_dt`` consumer -- ``lateral_boundary_clock_dt``
  (ingest/lateral_bc.py:214-217), KF/physics ``_model_clock_dt``
  (core/kf.py:22-31, core/physics.py:86-96), the RRTMGP interval
  derivation (core/rrtmgp.py), ``_clock_scaled_diff6_factor``
  (core/dycore.py:841-854), and the npref mirror (:3903) -- resolves
  ``clock_dt <= 0`` to ``cfg.dt``, so it is bit-equivalent to the frozen
  profile's ``clock_dt = dt`` integration transform at
  ``DYNAMICS_SUBSTEPS = 1``.  The frozen profile keeps passing its
  explicit ``integration_cfg`` through this loop unchanged.
- The radiation trace-gas override travels through
  :class:`woof.core.rrtmgp.RRTMGPRadiation`'s ``trace_gas_overrides``
  hook; a frozen profile's declared value is carried without conversion.

    ALONE: it selects the longest contiguous run of times present in the
    forcing FILES and never sees ``run_seconds``.  So a user who fetched
    a longer window than they integrate decodes the whole window into
    host memory, shortening the run does not shorten the decode, and no
    preflight says so -- ``woof check``'s ingest itemization prices
    DEVICE memory by its own definition
    (:class:`woof.core.preflight.IngestMemoryEstimate`).  This line is
    where that window is named.

    "BEYOND THE END", NOT "UNREAD".  A time past the run's end is NOT
    surplus to the prepared case, and saying so would be false in the
    same breath that says it: :func:`forcing_schedule` returns EVERY
    decoded time at or after ``start_time`` -- it truncates at nothing --
    and :func:`prepare_real_case` loops over all of them, interpolating
    each, building a state for each, adding each to the boundary frames,
    making an interval of every consecutive pair, and keeping the LAST as
    the case's final analysis.  So the remedy is real but it is not free:
    a narrower forcing window changes ``forcing_times``, the lateral
    boundary intervals and ``final_analysis``, and this says so where the
    reader will act on it.

    ``exp.run_seconds`` is the CONFIG's run length, which is what the
    sentence calls it: :mod:`woof.ensemble.member` overrides the leg
    length with its own argument after loading the pair, and the
    experiment this is handed is still the config's.

    ``snapshots`` is the ``{valid_time: Era5Snapshot}`` mapping

    """Physics rebuild + land-surface continuation for a relocated child.

    This is the ``on_child_built`` the real-data route hands the
    :class:`woof.core.relocation_runner.RelocationRunner`, plus the two
    duck-typed seams the runner drives around it:

    * ``capture_outgoing(node)`` -- before the move, while the outgoing
      child is whole: snapshot the driver-held land-surface continuation
      state (:data:`~woof.ingest.relocation_init.
      LAND_SURFACE_CONTINUATION_FIELDS`), the per-column physics
      continuation and the surface-radiation carriers with their
      provenance ledger (:mod:`woof.core.physics_continuation`), and
      keep a reference to the outgoing footprint's statics.
    * ``__call__(initialized, new_dc, parent_node)`` -- the rebuild:
      FIRST assert the footprint-rebuilt statics equal the outgoing
      child's bitwise on shared ground (identical source + identical
      cells = identical bytes; any mismatch is a statics-build defect
      and refuses), then build the donor-fill plan, move the land state
      (overlap by index-space transplant, strip from nearest
      same-landmask-class donors), and rebuild the physics driver
      against the NEW statics through the same ``initialize_landuse`` /
      ``initialize_physics`` / radiation wiring the t=0 child preparer
      uses.  Accumulators are re-initialised, per leg 1's contract, and
      the receipt says so.
    * ``after_move(node)`` -- once the node carries the new placement:
      refresh the run's prepared-case bookkeeping and the domain's
      wrfout metadata/global attributes so later frames describe the
      footprint that produced them.

    and the same rule, as every leg boundary and every relocation: the
    initializer never invents driver state, the route re-initialises it
    here.

    WHERE THE LAND STATE COMES FROM.  A newborn has no prior self to
    continue from, so unlike the relocation preparer there is nothing to
    capture; and it has no ``real.exe`` product at a footprint nobody knew
    about until the trigger fired, so unlike the t = 0 child preparer
    there is no analysis-derived soil either.  What it does have is the
    live parent, and that is precisely the case WRF's own nest
    initialization is built for: ``med_nest_initial`` fills the whole
    fine grid from ``med_interp_domain(parent, nest)`` BEFORE any input
    file is consulted, and for a nest without one that interpolation is
    the initialization (Users' Guide chapter 5; share/mediation_integrate
    .F:670).  So the land state is
    :func:`~woof.ingest.nest_spawn_init.spawn_land_state_from_parent` --
    the Registry's own masked surface interpolator, run against the
    newborn's OWN-GRID land-use categories -- and the driver rebuild is
    then the shared :func:`rebuild_child_driver_from_land_state`, byte
    for byte the sequence a relocation runs.

    ``last_receipt`` is the duck-typed seam the runner reads (the
    relocation runner's idiom), so the land accounting reaches the spawn
    receipt instead of dying here.

    domain sees that the consumer zeroed its window.  Cheap by construction
    -- one ``(ny, nx)`` plane per streamed domain per LEG boundary, not per
    step, and nothing at all when no domain streams.

    ``names`` is THIS consumer's slots and no one else's, on the same
    reasoning that gave the two consumers separate windows in the first place
    (WOOF's ruling, 2026-08-07): the relocation runner resets the follow
    window on its own cadence, from inside ``execute_experiment``, and a
    spawn boundary that published or adopted that window as well could undo a
    reset the tracker had already made or hand it a window measured against a
    boundary it does not own.

    Extraction of the frozen reference integration loop: intentionally free

    short forecasts and arbitrary configured output cadence.

    ``integration_cfg`` is the frozen profile's compatibility hook (its
    retired substep transform sets ``clock_dt = dt``); the experiment
    path leaves it ``None`` and integrates ``prepared.cfg`` as loaded
    (``clock_dt = 0.0``, which every consumer resolves to ``dt`` -- see
    the module docstring's equivalence notes).

    ``restart_path`` resumes a run: the deterministic preparation runs
    unchanged (rebuilding the setup and the resident LBC device tables),
    then :func:`woof.io.restart.restore_restart` overwrites the full
    cross-step state and restores the clock, and the loop continues from
    the restored outer step through ``run_seconds`` (the TOTAL forecast
    length from ``start_time``, exactly as for an uninterrupted run).
    The initial start-time wrfout is not rewritten on resume.
    ``run_seconds``/``history_interval_s``/``restart_interval_s`` are the
    experiment/domain timing authority.  Legacy callers omit them and use
    the compatibility copies on ``cfg``.

    ``write_final_output`` publishes the actual terminal state when a
    member leg ends between history times. The final microphysics call
    produces its output diagnostics through the ordinary history path.

    ``stepper`` is what one dynamics substep is taken with.  ``None`` binds
    ``woof.core.dycore.step`` ITSELF -- not a wrapper around it -- so a run
    that configures no ``[tiles]`` executes the identical call it always
    did.  ``woof.core.streaming.make_stepper`` returns either that same
    function or a :class:`~woof.core.streaming.StreamedDomain`, which has
    the same signature and advances the same domain by the same substep out
    of a pinned host store, one tile at a time.  The loop around it --
    history cadence, restart cadence, the REFL_10CM handshake -- is not aware
    of the difference and does not need to be.

    THE OBSERVERS ARE ASKED OF THE STEPPER, NOT OF THE STATE.  That is not
    tidiness, it is a correctness fix.  Under ``[tiles] store = "host"``
    the domain lives in a pinned host store and
    ``woof.core.streaming.attach`` fills it with ``gather.pinned_copy``,
    which COPIES: the prepared ``DomainState`` this function holds is a
    snapshot of t = 0 that no sweep ever writes again.  Reducing over it --
    which is what this loop did -- meant ``nan_free`` stayed true forever,
    ``w_max`` froze at its initial value, and a domain that went non-finite
    in the store completed and wrote a checkpoint recording that it had not.
    Keeping the state current instead is not available: the premise of the

    REFL remains D2 driver-rebuilt state.  At a true period boundary the
    producing step has stashed the field, this function consumes it, and the
    restart callback drains the resulting D2H publication before writing the
    tree checkpoint.  A restored model suppresses this already-committed
    callback per due domain, so no missing stash is ever read.

    The due predicate is THE DOMAIN'S OWN, not the experiment's.  This
    read used to be ``ticks != 0``, which is the right question only for
    a domain that starts with the experiment: a nest activating later
    has its first history frame due AT its activation epoch, before any
    of its steps has run, and consuming there raised "REFL_10CM output
    is due but no microphysics-time field is stashed" and killed the run
    at that frame (#205).  ``refl_10cm_stash_is_due`` asks the same
    question against the domain's own start tick, so the root's tick-0
    analysis frame and an activating nest's activation-epoch analysis
    frame are the one case they both are -- and every frame after either
