"""ctypes seam onto the Rust static-field builder (``static-fields``).

The library is ``tools/rustwx/crates/static-fields``, the port target
for everything in :mod:`woof.static` that processes bytes: projection
transforms, WPS_GEOG tile ingest, the geogrid-equivalent field build,
corridor geometry/crop, and the high-resolution overlay compute.  This
module owns ONLY the loading discipline and the low-level call
bindings; the public Python entry points (`build_static`,
`ProjectedGrid` methods, the highres appliers) keep their signatures
and route here by default once their lane lands.

Why ctypes rather than pyo3: same ruling as
:mod:`woof.io.nc_writer_bridge` -- every Rust library woof drives is
a cdylib behind ctypes; one loading discipline, one staging path, one
ABI-marker rule, no per-interpreter builds.

Default-on contract (WOOF's fixed-means-default law): once a lane
lands, the bare default path for its entry points is this bridge.  The
pure-Python implementation stays importable as the parity reference
and as an explicit fallback (``WOOF_STATIC_PYTHON=1``), and every use
of the fallback is a reported workaround, never silent.
