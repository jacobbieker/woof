"""Sealed child-resolution statics corridor for prepared moving nests.

The prepared (digest-bound) tree routes deliberately run WITHOUT their
ingest inputs, so a relocating nest had nothing to rebuild its statics
from and the tree runner refused ``[relocation]`` follow sources
outright.  The corridor closes that gap at PREPARATION time, when the
geography source IS on hand: statics are pre-built at CHILD resolution
over the ground the nest can REACH, sealed beside the other hierarchy
artifacts, and their digest is bound into the preparation document
exactly like every other sealed artifact.  At runtime a relocation CROPS
the new footprint's statics out of the corridor -- no runtime ingest, no
loosening of the digest relay.

WHICH GROUND.  The reach (:mod:`woof.core.nest_reach`): the child's
declared footprint widened by the most every mover above it (and the
child itself) can travel over the run -- from its follow settings, its
itinerary, the run length and the ``reach_speed_m_s`` bound -- and clipped
to the frame.  Before 2.8 every corridor covered the whole frame, which
made a storm-following 500 m nest over a 2,700 x 3,000 km parent a 25 GB
artifact and a 62 GB preparation.  A nest that can reach the whole frame
still gets the whole frame, and its receipt says why.

WHY A CROP IS EXACT.  The corridor grid is the child's reference grid
``translated`` onto the parent's first cell and re-extented to cover the
parent (:meth:`woof.static.projection.ProjectedGrid.translated`), so
every corridor cell evaluates its coordinates through the reference
grid's own float arithmetic at the reference's own index -- the same
bytes a placement-translated footprint build evaluates for that cell.
The static build is per-cell on those coordinates (accumulation order is
absolute-source-row-major, interpolation is native-tile-scoped, and the
terrain smoother's dependency cone lies inside the shared halo), so a
footprint cropped from the corridor is BITWISE the statics built
directly for that footprint from the same geography.  That equality is
the same invariant the relocation machinery already asserts on every
move (``identical source + identical cells = identical bytes``), and
tests/test_statics_corridor.py proves it against the build rather than
assuming it.

It also needs the SOURCE side to be placement-independent, which is what
the corridor's own extent put at risk: a corridor over a parent that
spans the antimeridian reads a source window crossing the wrap seam
while its child's footprint window does not.  The build bins every
source pixel at its canonical column for exactly that reason, and each
sealed corridor records the contract it was built under
(:data:`STATICS_CORRIDOR_BUILD_CONTRACT`) because the digest relay
proves WHICH BYTES preparation wrote and not which build wrote them.

MEMORY POSTURE.  The corridor is a DISK artifact loaded into HOST memory
by the runner's preflight; crops are host arrays consumed by the same
rebuild path the case-data route uses.  It adds no GPU residency: the
rebuilt child has the same device footprint at every placement.
