"""The named refusal type for the high-resolution static path.

A leaf module on purpose.  :mod:`woof.static.highres_production` owns the
refusals themselves and re-exports this class, so every existing
``from woof.static.highres_production import HighresRefusal`` keeps
working -- but the CLI's refusal boundary needs the *name* at except-clause
time on every single invocation, and importing the production module to
get it would drag numpy and the static builders into `woof version`.

This module imports nothing.  That is its entire reason to exist.
