"""Config-driven high-resolution static geography for real-data cases.

This is the production wrapper around the proven pilot machinery in
:mod:`woof.static.highres`: the ``[static.highres]`` TOML surface, the
refusal gates, the per-footprint tiled fetch/cache
(:mod:`woof.static.highres_fetch`), and the per-domain receipts.  The
science -- area averaging to WPS spherical grids, the land-cover
crosswalks into MODIS-21, the USDA soil-texture triangle, the water-mask
merge with donor climatology fill and TMN recompute -- is reused
wholesale, not rewritten.

Scope (deliberate, refuse-loudly outside it).  There are two modes, and
which one runs is stated in the console line, the receipt and the docs --
never inferred by the reader:

- ``fields = "all"`` replaces terrain, land use and soil.  Land cover
  comes from the selected row of
  :data:`woof.static.highres_fetch.LANDCOVER_SOURCES`:
  CGLC-MODIS-LCZ (global, 60 S to 78 N) by default, or Annual NLCD
  (United States) by name.  It refuses a footprint that lies WHOLLY
  outside the selected collection, naming the source.  Water follows the
  source's row: CGLC-MODIS-LCZ separates the sea from inland water
  itself; NLCD has one open-water class, which lands on WRF lake 21, and
  the domain's own 30-arc-second water field then moves the sea back to
  WRF ocean 17 (:func:`woof.static.highres._split_ocean_from_lake`),
  with both discriminated cell counts in the receipt.
- A source covers only where it is published.  Cells outside a source's
  coverage -- the sea past the land-cover collection's offshore edge,
  the far side of a national border, an unpublished terrain tile, a
  footprint that runs past the land-cover raster -- take the
  30-arc-second baseline the engine uses without this block, handed
  over across a few cells at the edge
  (:data:`woof.static.highres.COVERAGE_BLEND_CELLS`), with the count
  and bounds per field in the receipt and one plain console warning.
  Only a cell neither the source nor the baseline covers is refused.
- ``fields = "terrain"`` replaces terrain ONLY, from a near-global source
  (Copernicus DEM GLO-30 by default, SRTM 1 arc-second on request), and
  leaves land use, soil and every climatology on the 30-arc-second
  baseline.  It runs no land-use rule at all, so the ocean/lake split
  does not arise for it.  ``fields = "auto"`` takes it only where the
  selected land-cover source reaches no part of the footprint (poleward
  of 78 N or 60 S for CGLC-MODIS-LCZ).
- A domain whose footprint is continued past 180 degrees is refused
  before anything is fetched, because the mosaic window writer still
  emits the cut -180..180 frame; tile enumeration and source coverage
  already cross the line, the window writer does not yet.
- Coverage is per source, not per program: each source declares its own
  envelope (:data:`woof.static.highres_fetch.TERRAIN_SOURCES`) and the
  footprint is checked against the source actually selected.  A named
  source whose envelope the footprint lies wholly outside is refused,
  naming which dataset does not reach where; one it partly leaves is
  built, the rest taking the baseline.
- ``on_refuse`` selects between a hard error (default) and an explicit,
  receipted fallback to the unchanged 30s baseline.
- TMN is recomputed in both modes; monthly climatologies stay 30s with
  counted donor fill in the full mode and untouched in terrain-only.
- An enabled block that ends up replacing zero cells is itself a refusal:
  an enabled feature that did nothing must never look like it ran.  The
  one exception is a domain no source covers at all (open sea past every
  published tile): that is a coverage fact, stated by the warning and the
  receipt, not a feature that silently did nothing.

    import inside the mosaic step, which runs *after* the fetch, so a
    missing library cost the user 160.7 MiB of downloads and then a raw
    traceback.  Nothing about a missing library needs the network to
    discover, so nothing about it should wait for the network.

    What counts as "an engine" moved with the port, and the gate moved

    selected the fallback and its libraries are absent.  An environment
    carrying only the shipped default is complete, which it was not

    install for missing a library nothing on the default path reads.
