"""Per-domain terrain smoothing: WPS GEOGRID.TBL ``smooth_option`` and
``smooth_passes`` for HGT_M, with WPS's own arithmetic.

WPS geogrid smooths HGT_M with whatever its GEOGRID.TBL names (the stock
table: one ``smth-desmth_special`` pass).  This module is the static
builders' owner of that choice, one setting per domain:

* ``smth-desmth_special`` x1 is the default and keeps the builders'
  historical float64 arithmetic and code path exactly
  (:func:`woof.static.build.smth_desmth_special`), so a configuration
  that says nothing, or says the default, builds the bytes it always did.
  ``smooth_precision = "wps-float32"`` is the option that runs this same
  setting through WPS's single-precision sweeps below instead: the float64
  smoother's largest distance from geogrid.exe's HGT_M was 1.2 to 1.5 mm
  on the Alpine domains measured, and the sweeps reproduce it exactly
  (``SMOOTH_PRECISIONS``).
* ``none`` keeps the sampled halo-extended field as it is.
* Every other setting runs WPS v4.6.0's single-precision sweeps
  (geogrid/src/smooth_module.F, called by process_tile_module.F:884-914 on
  the memory array widened by HALO_WIDTH = 3, which is woof's ``HALO``):

  - a smoothing sweep is ``S = 0.5*A + 0.25*(west + east)`` over every row
    and the interior columns, then ``A = 0.5*S + 0.25*(south + north)``
    over the interior rows and columns, so the one-cell outer ring of the
    extended array never changes;
  - ``smth-desmth`` follows each smoothing sweep with a desmoothing sweep
    of the same shape, ``1.52*A - 0.26*(pair)``;
  - ``smth-desmth_special`` then gives every point that went negative
    from a non-negative start its start value back (after all passes);
  - every operation is rounded to float32 in Fortran's left-to-right
    order, never fused, and subnormals are kept.

  The result is cast back to float64 and cropped like the default.
  The Python arithmetic here and the Rust entry point behind
  :func:`smooth_terrain` are both held bit for bit to WPS itself
  (tests/test_terrain_smoothing.py, tools/wps_smooth_v460_oracle/).

The setting travels on :class:`woof.static.highres_production.
HighresStaticConfig` (``terrain_smoothing`` rows for the non-default
domains only, so every default identity and receipt is unchanged), and
reaches each builder through :class:`woof.static.build.GeogSelection`.
