"""Comparing grid geometry recorded on one machine with another's.

A grid is identified by its definition: the projection and its parameters
as given, the spacing, the dimensions, and for a nest the integer start
and ratio that place it (:meth:`ProjectedGrid.definition`).  Those values
are parsed from text or are integers, so every machine holds the same
bits for them, and they are compared exactly.

Positions that come out of projection arithmetic are different.  A nest's
reference point, a grid's centre and its latitude/longitude extremes are
computed through trigonometric functions whose last bit depends on the
math library and CPU path, so the same grid built on two machines can
disagree in the last digit (41.73852197541409 against 41.7385219754141
for one grid's northern edge).  Comparing those exactly refuses
a tree prepared on one machine and run on another although nothing about
the grid differs.  They are compared within
:data:`GRID_POSITION_TOLERANCE_CELLS` of a grid cell instead.
