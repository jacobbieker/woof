"""One source of truth for the high-resolution geography engine.

What turns fetched source tiles into model terrain -- the mosaic, the
void fill, the clip, the CRS construction, the reprojection onto the WPS
spherical grid and the area average -- is the Rust ``static-fields``
library, on the bare default of ``[static.highres] enabled = true``.  It
is a bundled artifact (``woof.bridge_assets.BUNDLED_ARTIFACTS``), staged
into a wheel install exactly as the NetCDF writer is, and ``woof
doctor`` reports it as the ``static builder`` row.

``rasterio`` and ``pyproj`` are the PARITY REFERENCE for that library and
the body of its one explicit workaround, ``WOOF_STATIC_PYTHON=1``.  They
are not what a default run reads, so they are not runtime dependencies:
they live in the ``[geog]`` extra.  A run that uses them prints a
WORKAROUND line and stamps ``static_compute`` on its receipt.

The history this module exists to prevent has not changed shape, only
subject.  Through 2.3.2 the geography stack was an optional extra nobody
named, and the only check for it sat *after* the tile fetch, deep inside
the mosaic step: following the published terrain doc on a documented
install downloaded 160.7 MiB of Copernicus tiles and then died on an
import, at exit 1, with a traceback and no remedy.  So two things hold
here regardless of which engine is in play:

- the probe is **cheap and callable before any network work**, so the
  front door can refuse in advance of the fetch rather than after it;
- the remedy is **one string, written once**, so the refusal, the deep
  guards and ``woof doctor`` cannot drift into naming different
  commands for the same missing piece.

Nothing here imports rasterio, pyproj or ctypes at module scope: this is
imported by ``woof doctor`` on boxes that may have none of them, and a
doctor that cannot run without the thing it diagnoses is useless.
