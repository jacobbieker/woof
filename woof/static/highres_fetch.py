"""Tiled, cached, provenance-recorded fetch for high-resolution geography.

This module turns one model-domain footprint (plus the geogrid processing
halo) into the concrete source artifacts :mod:`woof.static.highres`
consumes: terrain tiles (USGS 3DEP, Copernicus DEM, SRTM), one land-cover
raster (CGLC-MODIS-LCZ by default, or one Annual NLCD year), and SoilGrids
v2 sand/silt/clay WCS windows.  It is deliberately footprint-parametric --
nothing in here knows about any particular case or place; every
geographic number arrives from the caller's grid.

Contract:

- Sources that publish whole artifacts are fetched whole.  Terrain is
  fetched as complete 1x1-degree GeoTIFF tiles, CGLC-MODIS-LCZ as its one
  global GeoTIFF (pinned by size, MD5 and SHA-256) and Annual NLCD as the
  complete published CONUS year bundle; none is ever range-subset from
  the network.  SoilGrids is served by ISRIC's own WCS windowing service,
  which is the pilot-proven route for that source.
- Land-cover sources are table rows (:data:`LANDCOVER_SOURCES`): the
  fetch kind, the crosswalk into WRF's MODIS 21 categories, the water
  rule and the reference years are data, so another collection is a row,
  not a code path.
- Every fetched byte is hashed (SHA-256) at fetch time and the digest is
  recorded in a JSON sidecar next to the cached payload; receipts carry
  those digests.  Arbitrary user windows cannot be pre-pinned, so recorded
  provenance -- not a pinned manifest -- is the contract.
- A cache hit is a payload whose sidecar exists and whose byte count
  matches the sidecar.  Anything else is refetched (resumable ``.partial``
  staging, atomic rename), by one writer at a time per cached file; a
  preparation that finds another downloading the file waits for as long
  as that download keeps growing.
- Incomplete tile coverage refuses loudly, naming the missing tiles
  (:class:`CoverageError`).  A transient network fault is asked again
  with a bounded backoff, resuming the staged bytes; a network failure
  that outlasts it is :class:`HighresFetchRefusal`.  Transport failures
  are infrastructure faults, not coverage facts, and must never be
  converted into a silent fallback, so ``on_refuse = "fallback-30s"``
  does not apply to them.

    :func:`domain_footprint` continues a dateline domain's longitude range

    read it in that frame.  The window writers below (Rust bridge and the
    rasterio parity body alike) still emit the derived GeoTIFF in the cut
    -180..180 frame, so a continued window is the one thing they cannot
    express.

    Two different footprints arrive here and they are told two different
    things, because the fact and the way out differ:

    - A domain ON the line has a narrow continued range (179.28 .. 180.72
      and the like).  The tiles either side of the line would be pasted a
      planet apart, and moving the domain off 180 degrees builds.
    - A domain whose corners span 180 degrees of longitude or more has no
      continued range at all: :func:`_continued_longitude_range` reports
      it as the full -180..180 band, which the footprint margin then
      pushes past both ends of the cut frame.  Such a footprint occupies
      every longitude, and a domain wrapped around its projection pole is
      what produces it (the polar-stereographic domain that encloses the
      pole, the conic domain whose corners fan more than half a turn
      about the cone apex).  There is no line here and nothing to move
      off it, so the way out is a smaller domain, or one further from the
      projection pole, until its corners span less than 180 degrees.

    The two are told apart by width: the band is 360 degrees wide or more
    once padded, and a continued range is by construction narrower than
    180.

    This fires at PLAN REVIEW:
    :func:`woof.static.highres_production._apply` calls it on the
    footprint it has just computed, before the plan is resolved and
    before one byte is requested, so neither domain enumerates or
    downloads a tile it cannot mosaic.  Both window writers call it
    again as a backstop, so no door can disagree with another about one

    - GLO-30's longitude sampling is latitude-banded (3600 columns per
      degree below 50, 2400 in 50-60, 1800 in 60-70), so tiles from
      different bands do not share a resolution.  The output resolution is
      declared, not inherited, and the resampling is nearest so no
      elevation value is invented -- coarser bands are replicated, and the
      subsequent area-average to the model grid is what actually reduces
      them.
    - Unpublished tiles leave holes (and SRTM additionally carries an
      in-band void sentinel).  With ``sea_level_fill = None`` -- what the
      production overlay passes -- they stay no data (NaN), so the model
      cells under them take the 30-arc-second baseline terrain and are
      counted as outside the source's coverage.  A number fills them with
      that height instead (0 m on the EGM2008 geoid, the source's own
      vertical datum), and the filled pixel count is returned.

    The derivation itself -- decode, mosaic, void fill, re-emit -- runs
    in the Rust static-fields library by default; the rasterio body is
