"""What a release changed about the things a reader's scripts touch.

The upgrader persona built the 2.4.1 world for real, installed 2.5.0
over it, and could not tell from any door that anything had happened:
``woof doctor``'s report is shape-identical to 2.4.1's (only counters
move) and ``woof run --help`` was byte-identical.  The doors that
changed named 2.4.1 in their help; the doors that did not change said
nothing at all (UX finding N15).

So this is the one place a release records the handful of changes that
alter what an existing user SEES -- an output path that moved, a
command that split in two -- as opposed to everything a changelog
carries.  It is deliberately short and deliberately not the changelog:
a reader who has just upgraded wants the three sentences that explain
why their script's glob found nothing, not a hundred entries.

Every line is COMPOSED from the code that owns the behaviour --
:func:`woof.run_stamp.describe` and
:func:`woof.render_layout.describe` -- rather than transcribed beside
it, so a layout that moves again cannot leave a true-sounding sentence
behind.
