"""Immutable configuration-byte authority shared by CLI process phases.

Ordinary invocations read the requested source path.  A multi-run child is
instead given a create-only captured payload plus the digest and original
source path in its environment.  Every loader then consumes the captured
bytes, while the source path remains the diagnostic identity and relative
path base only.
