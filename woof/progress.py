"""Saying that something is still happening, on one shared mechanism.

Two measured findings from the 2.5.0 persona walks live here, and they
are the same finding twice.

**N9** -- ``woof setup`` spent 15.5 s of its 16.2 s in unbroken silence
while 315 MiB of Thompson tables came down.  Nothing was wrong; nothing
said so either, and a terminal that has printed nothing for a quarter of
a minute is indistinguishable from a hang.

**N10** -- fetch feedback was inverted.  The 792 MB table route printed
its opening line and then nothing at all until the manifest, while the
420 KB GFS route printed a line per file that *block-buffered* through a
pipe: 9.1 s of a 9.8 s fetch arrived in the log at once, at the end.

So: a byte counter with a throttle, and one call that makes a process's
own stdout flush per line.

The counter is on **stderr** deliberately.  ``woof setup`` captures each
step's stdout so it can print one status line per step and replay the
whole text on a refusal (:func:`woof.setup_cli._run_step`); a counter
written to stdout would be captured with it and reach the reader only
after the download it reports on had finished -- which is the silence
this module exists to end.

It also behaves differently on a terminal and in a log, because the two
readers want different things.  On a terminal the update rewrites one
line every fifth of a second, which is a moving number.  Redirected, a
rewritten line is nonsense, so the update is a new line and the throttle
is long: a handful of lines across a long transfer, not ten thousand.

    """Says which files are moving, while they are moving.

    THE REGRESSION THIS EXISTS FOR.  When every fetch went parallel
    through :mod:`woof.fetch_pool`, the per-file feedback of the serial
    loop went with it: six files moved at once and each said exactly one
    thing, at completion.  A user driving the Studio front end watched
    roughly three minutes of silence and then a burst of finished lines,
    and reported it -- a slow link and a hung command had become the
    same picture again, which is the finding :class:`ByteCounter` was
    written for and this class is the concurrent case of.

    Two surfaces, from one set of facts:

    * **stderr**, for a person.  One START line per file as its transfer
      begins, then a single consolidated line at a steady cadence that
      rewrites itself on a terminal and is appended sparsely to a log.
      Completion lines are NOT this class's -- the routes still print
      their own, unchanged, through :func:`format_transfer_done_line`.
    * **the run event stream**, for Studio, through the ambient
      :func:`event_sink`: ``fetch_started``, ``fetch_progress`` and
      ``fetch_completed``, one per file, flattened the way the run-plan
      stream's own events are.

    Every line is written with ONE ``write`` call, so a line from a
    worker thread can never appear inside a line from another.

        exists, so the very first consolidated line says out of how many

        queued nor a failed file can make the denominator move.  Sizes
