"""Fresh-process forecast supervision and durable run progress.

Forecast CUDA work runs in a fresh Python worker.  The supervisor owns the
physical-GPU lock, preflights active compute processes through ``nvidia-smi``,
launches that worker with the selected UUID mask, and watches an atomically
published heartbeat.  A CUDA-fatal condition is terminal for that worker
process.  Recovery, when possible, is a new process restored only from the
most recent durable manifest-valid restart; there is no in-process retry path.

    The UUID file lock is authoritative for excluding other woof runs.
    WDDM reports desktop graphics contexts in ``query-compute-apps``; pmon
    labels those ``C+G`` and they are explicitly permitted.  A pure ``C``
    process above the small context-noise threshold, or one whose own
    framebuffer figure is unmeasured, is a CO-TENANT: the run is priced
    against the device's measured free memory through
    :func:`shared_gpu_admission` and admitted when it fits, refused with
    both numbers when it does not.  Tool/parse failures still fail closed.

    ``allow_shared_gpu`` is accepted and has no effect: sharing is decided
    by measurement now, so the flag is a workaround for a capability that
    is default-on.  Its argparse help text feeds a generated document that
    is out of this lane's bounds, so it is retired in effect here and its
    wording is deferred.
