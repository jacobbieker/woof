"""``woof go``: launch the config through its declared native route.

Getting from a wizard-authored config to a forecast means five commands
in a fixed order, and three of them take values the previous one
printed: the front-door manifest's digest, then the preparation proof's
digest, its bound input-manifest digest, and its prepared-cache content
digest.  ``docs/public/FIRST-LIGHT.md`` section 3a spells the relay out
and says "copy it rather than retyping".

That relay is integrity plumbing.  Every one of those digests exists so
a later stage can refuse inputs an earlier stage did not produce, and
none of them is a decision a person makes -- so asking a person to
carry them is asking them to be a checksum courier, which is how a
first run ends in a transcription error three stages deep.

**What this does not do is weaken a single check.**  ``go`` runs the
same commands, as subprocesses, in the documented order, and every
artifact lands on disk exactly where the manual chain leaves it.  The
relayed values are read back from those artifacts -- ``sha256`` of the
manifest file, and the three digests carried inside ``proof.json`` --
never scraped from a stage's printed prose.  Prose is a presentation
layer that ``--explain`` is free to move; the artifacts are the
contract.  Each stage still verifies what it always verified, against
values ``go`` transported but did not compute.

**Ordering is not negotiable and there is no continue-on-failure.**
The authority materialization has to precede preprocessing, because the
runner binds the experiment config into the prepared cache and doing it
afterwards means preprocessing twice.  Every later stage consumes the
previous one's output, so a failed stage replays its whole output and
stops -- unlike ``woof setup``, whose steps are independent.

The configuration chooses the execution route. Declared `[case_data]`
inputs use the experiment runner; other sources use their registered
native preparation chain. Both routes share the human progress and render
stages, and each retains its own input and physics validation.

    ``transport`` is ``woof go --transport``: it wins over the config's
    ``[fetch] transport``, and the plan records which one it took.

    ``render_section`` is the line every ``xsec:`` product of this run
    is cut along (``woof render --section``), carried to all three of
    its renders: the one the forecast draws as each frame lands, its
    early first frame, and the end-of-run batch.

    ``run_stamp`` puts this run's whole tree -- authority, prepared,
    run, png -- in its own timestamped folder under the output
    directory, which is the default and the reason two runs of one
    config no longer collide. Downloads use a request-specific cache shared
    across matching runs; changing the cycle or area selects another cache
    automatically without replacing the previous inputs.

    A plan NAMES that folder; it does not create it.  The gates in
    :func:`go_main` refuse before anything is spent and a refused run
    must leave the disk as it found it, so the directory is claimed by
    :func:`claim_run_root` at the moment the first stage is about to
    write -- create-exclusively, so two chains started inside one second
    take two folders rather than sharing one and publishing receipts
    describing neither.  ``claim=True`` folds that step in for a caller
    that wants the plan and the folder in one call.

    Read from the wizard's own emitted tables rather than asked for
    again: ``[fetch]`` carries the resolved cycle, hours and area the
    wizard sized the domain against, and the physics tables carry the
    profile.  A flag that re-asked for any of them would let the two
    disagree, and the run would then be sized for one box and fetched
    for another.

    """The sixth stage: turn the forecast into pictures.

    ``go`` used to stop after the forecast and print this line for the
    reader to paste.  That is one more baton pass, and a baton pass is
    where a first run ends -- a command printed instead of run reads as
    "it stopped", not "your turn".  Every other handoff in this chain is
    internal now; this one has no reason to be the exception, and the
    reader who typed ``woof go`` wanted a forecast they can look at.

    ``woof render`` takes FILES.  The documented line spells them
    ``.../wrfout/*`` and relies on a shell to expand that; a subprocess
    has no shell, and handing the directory over produced "unreadable
    wrfout (not a regular file)" on a run that had otherwise finished.
    So the frames are enumerated here.  ``frames=None`` keeps the
    glob spelling, which is what ``--dry-run`` should print: at that
    point the directory is empty and naming its contents would be a
    guess.

    That glob is :data:`WRFOUT_GLOB` -- the FRAMES, not everything in
    the directory.  It used to be ``*``, which is the same set only on
    a route that keeps its frames in a ``wrfout/`` subdirectory of its
    own.  A downscaled child writes them in the run root beside
    ``events.jsonl``, ``report.json``, its checkpoints and its picture
    tree, so the remedy line this function prints fed all of those to
    the renderer and stopped at "NetCDF: Unknown file format".

    And when frames are ALREADY on disk, ``frames=None`` names them
    rather than the pattern, because the line this composes is pasted
    into a shell: :func:`printable` quotes any token holding a ``*``,
    so the pattern reaches the renderer's argv literally on a shell
    that would have expanded it -- and PowerShell, where a reader on
    this platform pastes it, expands nothing for a native command at
    all.  The pattern is printed when the directory holds no frame yet,
    which is the ``--dry-run`` case and the only one where naming its
    contents would be a guess.

    The run folder is claimed ONCE, by the chain, and this stage draws
    into it: :func:`woof.run_stamp.stage_flags` is what says so.  This
    command is composed twice for one run -- once by
    :mod:`woof.first_products` on the first committed frame and once by
    :func:`_render_stage` at the end -- so a render that stamped for
    itself would put those two halves of one run's pictures in two
    wall-clock folders, and the finalize stage could no longer prove the
    early frame had already been drawn.

    ``inputs_file`` is for a command this process RUNS whose frames do
    not fit on a command line (:func:`run_render_pass` decides): the
    frames and their context are written into that file and the command
    names the file (``--inputs-from``).  One path per frame on the
    command line is how a 48 h nested forecast asked Windows for a 36,519
    character command, 32,767 being the most it starts, and never drew a
    picture.  A printed line keeps the frames spelled out, because the
    reader pasting it has no such file.

    Output is captured so the default is one line per stage, and
    released in full the moment a stage fails -- the reason a stage
    refused is never summarized, because a chain that stops without
    saying why leaves the reader with five commands to re-run by hand
    to find out.

    Captured output means a quiet stage is a quiet terminal, and two of
    these stages run for minutes.  An owner watching one of them
    concluded the tool had hung.  So while a stage runs, this prints a
    line every ``heartbeat_seconds`` naming the stage, how long it has
    been going, and -- when the stage publishes a progress file -- what
    it says it is doing.  The heartbeat is a property of waiting, not of
    verbosity: it is not behind ``--explain``, because the reader who
    needs it is the one who did not pass any flags.

    ``door`` names the command the reader typed, for the one sentence
    below that addresses them directly.

    The output is read as the stage writes it (:func:`_read_stage_output`),
    and each preparation step record in it goes to the observer's ``warn``
    as a ``preparation_progress`` record while the stage runs, which is
    how a run page hears a preparer program's steps.

    ``env`` adds to the environment every stage gets (:func:`_stage_env`)
    the few names THIS stage needs -- the render stage's own scratch
    token, today.  Added here rather than spelled onto the command line
    because these lines are also printed for a reader to paste, and a
    pasted line carrying one run's private token would be wrong the
    moment it is reused.

    ``shown`` is the command as a reader would type it, when that is not
    the one run: the render stage hands its frames over in a private file
    it removes when the stage ends (:func:`render_inputs_file`).  The
    ``stage_begin`` event carries ``shown``, frames spelled out, because
    a recorded command naming that file names nothing once the stage is
    over.

    ``stopped`` answers whether the chain itself ended this stage (the
    as-posted fetch beside a preparation or forecast that failed,
    :meth:`_BesideStage.stop`).  A stage the chain stopped that then exits
    nonzero is said as stopped, not failed: no FAILED line, no "stopped
    at" sentence and no ``stage_failed`` or failed ``stage_end`` for the
    observer, and :class:`GoStageStopped` is raised.  The breakage this
    prevents: a preparation that failed while the fetch still ran was
    reported as a failed fetch with the fetch's exit 130 (the interrupt
    code), on the terminal and in a hosting run's failure record.

    ``secondary_failure`` says another callback already failed first.
    The process continues and keeps its actual error and timing, but its
    later failure closes through ``stage_secondary_end`` rather than
    announcing that this stage stopped the run.
