"""Which endpoints a cycle is asked for, and which one moves the bytes.

Every NCEP source publishes on two hosts that serve byte-identical
objects under byte-identical keys -- verified by HEAD against the live
services: the operational server and the AWS Open Data archive answer
the same relative key with the same ``Content-Length`` for GFS, GDAS,
GEFS, HRRR, RAP and RRFS alike.  So the choice between them is never
about the data.  It is about three things, and only three:

* **Freshness.**  The operational server publishes each object hours
  before any mirror has it.  A run initialized from the newest cycle
  is asking for exactly that.
* **Retention.**  The operational server keeps a bounded window --
  measured by counting the day directories the live tree serves, two
  days for HRRR/RAP/RRFS, four for GEFS, ten for the GFS tree -- and
  the archive keeps everything.
* **Throughput.**  The operational server paces bulk transfers and the
  archive does not.  Measured at peak hours: about 3 MB/s per file
  against the archive serving the same 3.4 GB in roughly a sixth of
  the wall clock.

All three are DATA, declared per endpoint in
``authorities/rw-wps-fetch-routes.v1.json``, and this module is the one
engine that reads them.  Adding a model, or moving a host, is a row
there; nothing here branches on a source name, and the ladder shape is
identical for a route whose transport is table-driven and for the three
whose transport predates the table.

**Two orders over the same rungs.**  :func:`serving_ladder` answers
"which endpoints is this cycle asked for, and in what order" from
retention alone: a latest initialization keeps both, a reanalysis-era
cycle goes straight to the archive without paying for an attempt that
was certain to 404.  :func:`transfer_order` answers a different
question -- "which of them should actually move the bytes" -- from the
declared ``transfer_rank``.

They differ for exactly one reason.  The operational server's
advantage is having the cycle FIRST, and that advantage is spent the
moment the mirror has the same object; what is left after that is
throughput, and the mirror wins it.  So for each requested object
inside the retention window the caller asks the throughput rung
whether it HAS that object -- one HEAD, milliseconds against a
multi-hundred-megabyte transfer -- and :func:`promote` moves it to the
head when it does.  Promotion REORDERS the ladder and never shortens
it: every other rung stays behind the chosen one, so fall-through, the
fault vocabulary and the whole-ladder refusal are unchanged, and a
probe that 404s or errors costs the transfer nothing.

Retention is an optimisation, never a bar.  When NO endpoint's window
covers the age -- a source with no archive behind it -- the whole
ladder is still tried, because a host that MIGHT still hold the cycle
beats a refusal that never asked.

    bytes, so a host that refuses, throttles, or serves something that
    does not verify is a reason to ask the next one, not a reason to
    end the fetch.

    This is the one retry every source's fetch runs through: the table
    routes' transfers and the Rust backbone's GFS and HRRR transfers.
    After a round in which every endpoint failed, the ones whose fault
    ``delay(error, attempt)`` calls transient (default
    :func:`retry_delay`: a reset or dropped connection, a timeout, a
    body cut short, HTTP 408, 429 or 5xx) are asked again after the
    longest of their waits, for at most ``attempts`` rounds
    (:data:`TRANSIENT_ATTEMPTS`).  A permanent refusal falls through
    once and is not asked again.  Faults that are not an endpoint's (an
    interrupt, a full disk) propagate unchanged, because the next
    endpoint would fail identically and walking the ladder over them
    would bury the real refusal.  ``discard(endpoint)`` removes what a
    failed attempt staged.  ``pause(seconds)`` waits between rounds and
    by default stops early once another file has failed the request.

    A host that declares a :class:`Throttle` row and answers with it
    ("slow down", S3's ``503 SlowDown``) is not held to the round count:
    it is asked again after the row's doubling, jittered wait until the
    row's time budget is spent, and the log says which host is throttling
    and how much of the budget is gone.  ECMWF's AWS mirror answers about
    half of all requests that way, and 5 rounds in 30 s refused files a
    plain GET then served.  ``jitter()`` draws the random part of each
    wait (default :func:`random.random`).

    When every round is spent, :class:`TransferRefusal` names the file,
    each endpoint and why, the rounds and the seconds waited, followed
