"""Native meteorological-source adapter inventory for WRF initialization.

This registry is deliberately stricter than a decoder capability list.
Runnable means a strict implementation route exists; certification separately
requires that its exact field, vertical-level, cadence, missing-state, and
domain envelope has been accepted by unchanged stock ``wrf.exe``. Merely being
readable by the Rust GRIB decoder does not make a product a scientifically
complete limited-area initial state.
