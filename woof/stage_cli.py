"""The pipeline's stages, each invocable on its own terms.

WRF's usability model is separate executables -- ungrib, metgrid, real,
wrf -- that a person drives from their own script, each reading and
writing files at a documented boundary.  ``woof go`` welded the
equivalent stages shut inside one route: the capability was all there,
but the only supported way in was the whole chain, with our fetch, our
directory layout and our render on the end of it.  A collaborator
running his own pipeline said so in as many words -- he wants to pull
his own data, author his own namelist, run OUR preprocessing on HIS
inputs, then run OUR simulation alone, with nothing fetching and
nothing plotting.

This module is that unbundling.  Three stages, three front doors:

``woof prep``
    Preprocessing, on inputs the caller supplies.  It is not a
    reimplementation of anything: it ADOPTS :mod:`woof.source_cli`'s
    parser through argparse ``parents=`` and calls that module's own
    dispatch, so ``rw-wps`` and ``woof prep`` are one program with two
    spellings and cannot drift.  Nothing here fetches.

``woof sim``
    The forecast, on a prepared tree that already exists.  It reads the
    bundle's own document -- ``proof.json`` or ``receipt.json`` -- to
    learn which source prepared it and whether it is a single domain or
    a tree, relays the digests that document carries to the runner, and
    calls the runner in this process so every line the model prints
    reaches the caller's terminal unbuffered by a pipe.  No fetch, no
    render, no network: :func:`sim_main` reaches dispatch without
    importing :mod:`woof.fetch` at all, and
    ``tests/test_stage_seams.py`` asserts exactly that in a fresh
    interpreter.

``woof render``
    Already stood alone -- it takes wrfout files and writes PNGs -- and
    keeps its own front door in :mod:`woof.render`.  It is named here
    because the contract document treats the three as one family.

``woof go`` is unchanged and stays: it is the average user's front
door.  What changes is that it is now provably a COMPOSITION of these
stages rather than the only way to reach them -- the equivalence gates
in ``tests/test_stage_seams.py`` assert that the command ``go`` composes
for its preparation stage is the command ``woof prep`` runs, and that
the command ``go`` composes for its forecast stage is the command
``woof sim`` runs, for both the single-domain and the tree arm.

**The digest relay is not a convenience and it is not a weakening.**
Every stage of this pipeline refuses inputs the previous stage did not
produce, by comparing a digest the caller supplies against one it
recomputes.  ``woof sim`` reads those digests off the artifacts on
disk and hands them to the runner; the runner still recomputes and
still refuses.  What a caller no longer has to be is a checksum
courier.  A third party who would rather carry them by hand can see the
exact command with ``--print-command`` and run it themselves -- that is
the documented boundary, and it is a real one.

    A forecast writes ``wrfout`` frames named for their valid time, one
    ``report.json`` and one progress stream.  Run the same prepared tree
    twice into one directory and the second run's frames land among the
    first's under identical names while ``report.json`` ends up

    draws one product series out of two different runs, with nothing in
    any file saying so.  That is the breakage the stamped folder
    prevents, and the refusal below is the same breakage stated for the
    one path that can still reach it.

    ``--outdir`` pointed at an existing run folder, or at anything under
    one, is honoured verbatim (the run's identity is already
    established: :func:`woof.run_stamp.owning_run`), so that path
    REFUSES when the folder already holds a forecast rather than writing
    into it.  Asked through that one predicate and not through the
    folder's own name, because ``--print-command`` names the folder with
    :func:`woof.run_stamp.resolve` and the real run makes it with
    :func:`woof.run_stamp.allocate`: two spellings of "is this already
    a run's tree?" is how the printed ``--outdir`` and the written one
    come apart, which is the exact contract ``--print-command`` exists
    to keep.

    ``claim=False`` NAMES the folder without making it, which is what
    ``--print-command`` needs: that flag's own contract is that asking
    the question spends nothing, and a directory is something.  The
    refusal above is still evaluated, because a question whose answer is
    "this would overwrite a finished run" should say so rather than
    print a line that will fail.
