"""Declarative stock-WRF initialization inventories for RW-WPS.

This module deliberately answers a narrower question than woof's forecast
physics dispatcher: which package fields must exist when RW-WPS writes a
``wrfinput_dNN`` for an unchanged WRF v4.6.1 executable?  The inventory is
derived from ``Registry/Registry.EM_COMMON`` package declarations and field
I/O flags.  It must not be inferred from the schemes implemented by woof.

WRF Registry dimensions ``ikjftb`` become the NetCDF dimensions below.  WRF
``real.exe`` initializes package hydrometeors/moments to zero when the source
analysis does not provide them; water vapour is populated from the source.
Package ``state:`` auxiliaries whose Registry flags contain ``r`` but not
``i`` are runtime/restart state and are intentionally not invented as
``wrfinput`` variables.  The converse half of that rule first bites at
mp_physics=28: ``qnwfa2d``/``qnifa2d`` are ``state:`` members whose flags DO
carry ``i0``, so they are inventoried as ``wrfinput`` fields (with 2-D
dimensions) rather than as runtime state.  See :func:`_aerosol_emission`.

Units are the value WRF's Registry parser RESOLVES, not the text of the
Registry line; see :data:`WRF_RESOLVED_UNITS_NUMBER_PAREN`, which also
records the one place this module is knowingly inconsistent.

#: The thermodynamic representation every stock-WRF export declares and
#: holds: dry potential temperature, WRF's ``use_theta_m = 0``.  The engine
#: integrates dry theta, so the prepared cache the exporter reads holds dry
#: theta in its state and mass-coupled dry theta in its lateral-boundary
#: tables (woof/ingest/lateral_bc.py, ``_coupled_device_fields``).  The
#: export (woof/wrf_direct.py) writes exactly that: ``USE_THETA_M = 0`` on
#: both files, ``THM`` equal to ``T`` (what real.exe writes under
#: ``use_theta_m = 0``, tests/data/real_em_461_theta_seam_west_strip.
#: README.md), and ``T_B*`` straight from the tables.
#:
#: Until this constant existed the pair was mixed: the header said
#: ``USE_THETA_M = 1`` and ``THM`` held moist theta, while ``T_B*`` held
#: the same dry-coupled tables.  WRF couples its prognostic into ``T_B*``
#: (main/real_em.F:872), so a ``use_theta_m = 1`` wrf.exe read those rows
#: as moist theta and its specified boundary came out colder than the
#: analysis by theta * Rv/Rd * qv / (1 + Rv/Rd * qv) from the first step
#: (measured with stock WRF V4.6.1: 2.887 K at qv = 4 g/kg, the prediction
#: to 4e-5 K; the same pair written dry holds the boundary to 3e-5 K).
#:
#: It lives here, beside the other facts a stock wrfinput must satisfy,
#: because this module imports nothing: every stock-WRF namelist the tree
#: renders for an export reads its ``use_theta_m`` from this name, and the
#: routes refuse a stock namelist that says otherwise.  WRF's input gate
#: (share/input_wrf.F) stops with "use_theta_m values must be consistent"
#: when the namelist and the file disagree.

#: What WRF actually stores as a field's ``units``, which is NOT the text of
#: the Registry line.  ``tools/reg_parse.c:203-208`` walks every raw Registry
#: line before tokenizing and, for a ``#`` INSIDE double quotes, replaces it
#: with a blank (``:206``, ``else if ( *p == '#' && inquote ) *p = ' ' ;``);
#: a ``#`` outside quotes starts a comment (``:207``).  So the Registry text
#: ``"# kg(-1)"`` becomes ``'  kg(-1)'`` -- two leading blanks, one from the
#: blanked ``#`` and one that was already there -- and that string is what
#: WRF's generated tables carry and what its own writer emits as the NetCDF
#: ``units`` attribute.  Inside the generated ``mp_physics(idomain)==28``
#: block (``inc/scalar_indices.inc:2449-2618``) the six scalar members are
#: spelled ``'  kg-1'`` for ``P_qni`` (:2544) and ``'  kg(-1)'`` for
#: ``P_qnr`` (:2558), ``P_qnc`` (:2572), ``P_qnwfa`` (:2586), ``P_qnifa``
#: (:2600) and ``P_qnbca`` (:2614); the table is consumed as "! Units" at
#: ``inc/wrf_bdyout.inc:1449``.  woof's own WRF-output authority already
#: agrees: ``woof/io/wrfout.py::_VAR_META`` was verified against a stock
#: v4.6.1 wrfout and spells QNCLOUD/QNRAIN ``"  kg(-1)"`` and QNICE
#: ``"  kg-1"``.
#:
#: KNOWN DIVERGENCE, stated rather than hidden: the mp=6/8/10/18 rows below
#: predate this finding and carry the pre-parse Registry spelling
#: (``"# kg(-1)"``).  They are left byte-identical here on purpose -- they
#: are consumed by a shipped compatibility report and are not this change's
#: subject -- so the same NetCDF variable (QNRAIN) is spelled two ways in
#: this module depending on the package.  Only the mp=28 row is
#: authoritative on units.
