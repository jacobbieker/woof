"""The named reasons an ensemble request is refused, shared by every door.

Standard library only, and no import of the ensemble package.  The config
loaders (:func:`woof.experiment.build_experiment`,
:func:`woof.config.load_config`) call into this module on every load, and
they are staged into the preparation-only wheel, which carries no ensemble
runtime.

Each refusal here names the breakage it prevents:

* random spread whose amplitude has no observation calibration
  (:data:`UNCALIBRATED_SPREAD_REASON`): the spread and the probabilities
  drawn from it would mean nothing;
* N > 1 members that would all run one input (:func:`copies_breakage`):
  the run is N copies of one forecast, published with zero spread and
  probabilities of 0 or 1;
* listed member sources that no door binds
  (:func:`unbound_sources_refusal`): every member would run the one
  prepared input under the listed names;
* an ``[ensemble]`` table on a door that opens no ensemble session
  (:func:`table_not_honoured`): the table would be dropped and one
  forecast would run under the name of the ensemble it describes;
* the 2.8.4 overlay table or a perturbation provider name at a door that
  reads neither (:func:`overlay_table_refusal`,
  :func:`provider_name_refusal`): the run would not be the ensemble the
  file describes.
