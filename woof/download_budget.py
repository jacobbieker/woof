"""What a run downloads and what its preparation writes, priced before either starts.

A run's disk holds four things: the source files it downloads, the files
its preparation writes from them, its history files and checkpoints, and
its pictures.  :mod:`woof.disk_budget` projects the last two from the
grid.  This module prices the first two, from sizes measured on real
downloads and real preparations, kept as rows of the packaged table
``woof/data/download-bytes.v1.json``:

* **The download** is one figure per plan: the objects the fetch will
  request, each priced at the size measured for its source, byte
  transport and role.  The objects are counted the way the fetch counts
  them, by the fetch's own functions: the table route's resolved object
  list, or the lead ladder of a transport that predates the route table.
  A source whose transport crops to an area (the NOMADS grib filter, the
  ERA5 retrieval) is priced per grid point of the requested area.  A
  route that composes files after the transfer (a GEFS a/b pair, a GDPS
  valid time) keeps the objects beside the composed copy, and both are
  priced.  The full-file default stays the default; it is priced, not
  replaced.
* **The preparation** is priced per cell of the grids, from the bytes a
  measured preparation of the same chain wrote: per cell and forcing
  time on the outer grid (the forcing series the preparation writes for
  every time it was given), plus per cell once (the initial state and
  the static fields), plus per cell of every nest.
* **What is already on disk** is the files a fetch receipt of the same
  request names in the folder the download lands in, and nothing else
  in that folder (:func:`present_bytes`).

The transport priced is the one the fetch will take, asked through the
fetch's own functions, including the switch to whole archive objects
for a GFS or GDAS cycle the grib-filter host no longer keeps.

Adding a source is a row in that table, never a function here: the
arbitrary acceptance test.  A source or transport with no row is
reported as unpriced, by name, rather than priced at a guess.

Both figures were left out of every disk projection until 2026-09-26: an
18 hour HRRR run downloaded 22 GB that no estimate showed, and an event
page layout projected at 15.2 GiB had written 28.9 GB by its first
forecast step, 18.9 GB of it downloads and 9.6 GB preparation.
