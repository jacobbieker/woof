"""``woof render`` -- forecast product PNGs from wrfout NetCDF files.

Two engines render:

* ``rust`` -- the vendored Rusty Weather production renderer
  (``tools/rustwx``, :mod:`woof.rustwx`): the campaign product sheets'
  quality tier, with basemaps and typography.  Its vendored catalog
  carries 324 entries, 151 of which the runtime lister evaluates as
  implicit-render candidates per file -- surface fields, the full
  200-850 mb isobaric chart families, CAPE/CIN/SRH/shear/STP severe
  suite, the heavy ECAPE family (``--heavy``), and multi-hour windowed
  accumulations -- and everything a file's stored fields prove out
  renders (``--list-products`` shows the per-file verdict and every
  reason).
  The ONLY engine ``--engine auto`` will select, and the only one any
  in-process caller or chain reaches.
* ``matplotlib`` -- the wrf-rust + matplotlib path below, reachable
  only by typing ``--engine matplotlib``, and announcing itself as a
  ``WORKAROUND:`` line on every run.

The project render law ( 2026-08-06) reserves weather-field
product plots for ``rw_wrfbatch`` and names exactly ONE permitted
fallback, ``tools/da_nowcast_render.py``, which composes multi-panel
sheets from a DA nowcast case directory and serves none of this door's
products.  ``--engine auto`` therefore does not degrade: with no usable
renderer it REFUSES, naming the missing artifact and ``woof
fetch-bridges``, at a nonzero exit.  It used to draw five weather
fields with matplotlib and report success, which is how a box with a
failed bridge staging produced pictures that looked like the
production catalog and were not it.

``--pair A_DIR B_DIR`` composes two runs' rendered PNGs into labeled
side-by-side comparison sheets (:mod:`woof.pair_compose`) -- either
engine's output pairs.

``--streamlines`` / ``--barbs`` choose how the wind is drawn on every
product carrying a wind layer.  Neither given, the engine keeps its
automatic per-grid choice (streamlines on curvilinear and projected
grids, barbs on plain lat/lon) and the invocation is byte-identical to
every earlier release.  ``RUSTWX_WIND_STREAMLINES`` still works and
these two outrank it: a flag a stale shell export could silently
overrule would be a flag that lies.

``--products var:<stored name>`` draws any 2-D field the wrfout carries,
INCLUDING one added to a user's own WRF Registry -- ``MSLP_ANOM`` is
imported as ``wrf_mslp_anom`` and rendered by ``--products
var:wrf_mslp_anom`` with no product definition written anywhere.
``--list-products`` names every ``var:`` row a given file can serve.

Both engines file what they draw through :mod:`woof.render_layout`:
``<--out>/<domain>/<product>/<valid-day>/<file>.png``, by default and
without a flag.  Every picture used to land in one directory, which on
a three-nest run of the rust catalog is five figures of files of every
product and every valid time with nothing but filenames to sort them.
``--layout flat`` restores the v2.4.1 single directory for a consumer
that still needs it.  See ``docs/render-output-layout.md``.

Every output filename carries a domain + resolution token
(:func:`domain_token`: ``d02-3km``, sub-kilometre nests as ``d05-111m``)
read from the file's own ``GRID_ID`` and ``DX``.  Without it two nests
of one run share every other filename component and the second render
at a lead silently overwrote the first -- a forecast lost with no error
and an exit code of 0.  The same spacing appears in the plot subtitle
as ``Δx 3 km``, and plots are labelled with the model that produced
them (``--source-label``, default :func:`default_source_label`) rather
than the GDEX fetch source the rust engine's ``wrf`` store identity
inherits.  That default carries the version of the code that is
EXECUTING (``ArWen 1.8.7``), which is not the same number as
``woof.__version__``: see :func:`default_source_label`.

Every derived quantity comes from the mandated ``wrf`` package (pip
distribution ``wrf-rust``): destaggering, earth-rotation, and unit
conversion are ``wrf.getvar`` calls, never local formulas.  When a file
carries no earth-rotation fields (idealized/minimal wrfouts without
SINALPHA/COSALPHA), the 10 m wind panel falls back to grid-relative raw
``U10``/``V10`` in the model's native m/s and labels both the barbs and
the colorbar accordingly -- an accurate degradation, not a hand-rolled
conversion.  The one composition performed here is WRF's own
accumulation-bucket total (``RAINC + RAINNC``), which is bookkeeping
over Registry accumulators rather than a diagnostic.  Composite reflectivity is the column maximum
of the model-native ``REFL_10CM`` -- a direct field product, matching
``tools/matched_wrfout_refl_figures.py`` -- not a re-derived simulated
reflectivity.

Rendering conventions follow that tool: Agg backend, the standard NWS
5-dBZ reflectivity scale, recessive axes, per-panel colorbars labeled
with units, and valid-time titles.  Geographic extent is the file's own
XLAT/XLONG curvilinear coordinates (``wrf.latlon_coords``), so terrain
and projection shape the frame instead of bare array indices.

The module imports ``wrf`` and matplotlib lazily: ``woof --help`` and
every non-render command work without the render extra installed, and
the failure names the missing dependency and the install command.

    THE product stamp, and the reason it is a function rather than a

    matplotlib engine through :func:`plot_context`, and the rust engine
    through ``--source-label``, which ``rw_wrfbatch`` renders as its
    ``subtitle_right`` without interpreting it.  So whatever this
    returns is literally the label a reader sees on the image, and it
    is the only place on a PNG where the producing build can be named
    at all.

    The number comes from :func:`woof.provenance_gate.executing_version`
    and NOT from ``woof.__version__``, because those two are not the
    same claim.  ``__version__`` asks distribution metadata for the
    version of the distribution NAMED woof, which on a box with a
    stale editable install answers for a tree that is not the one
    running -- exactly the field report this program was opened for,
    where plots were labelled 1.6.2 and the reader believed they had
    installed 1.8, and nothing in the product could say which of them
    was right.  ``executing_version`` prefers the running code's own
    declaration, so the label describes the code that drew the image.

    An install that genuinely cannot name its version contributes
    nothing rather than the ``0+unknown`` sentinel: a plot is not a
    diagnostics channel, and a bare ``WOOF`` is the accurate label there.

    frames have carried since 1.5.1, so this is the one product here whose
    subject is the model as a satellite would see it.

    Inverted grayscale is what makes it read that way: an IR image is dark
    where the emitting surface is warm and bright where it is cold, and OLR
    runs the same direction -- deep cold cloud tops emit least, the clear
    warm surface emits most -- so ``gray_r`` puts storm tops white against a
    dark background exactly as the imagery convention does.

    The panel stays in W m-2 rather than converting to a brightness
    temperature.  That conversion is a derived quantity and derived
    quantities are the ``wrf`` package's job, never a formula written at a
    plotting site (the same rule that keeps ``_render_wind10`` degrading to
    m s-1 instead of converting knots by hand).

    Limits come from the frame, as they do for ``t2`` and ``wind10``: there
    is no standard OLR ladder to hard-code, and inventing one here would put
    unsourced numbers between the reader and the field.  So shade is
    comparable within a panel, not between panels -- read the colorbar.

#: This maps four of the five in :data:`PRODUCTS`.  ``olr`` is absent
#: because the rust catalog has no OLR chart yet -- that half is upstream
#: work in the renderer's own catalog, and the entry lands here when the
#: slug it would name exists.  Pointing an alias at a plausible-looking
#: slug before then is precisely the ``wind10`` bug described below: a
#: mapping that reads correct and returns the wrong chart.  Until the
#: catalog carries one, ``--products olr --engine rust`` passes ``olr``
#: through as a raw slug and the renderer refuses it by name, which is a
#: legible answer; ``--products all --engine rust`` is unaffected, since
#: ``all`` is the renderer's own catalog and never this table.
#:
#: Each value is the slug of a chart whose SUBJECT is what the key
#: names.  ``wind10`` used to map to ``mslp_10m_winds`` under a comment
#: calling that "the catalog's standalone surface-wind product"; it is
#: not.  ``mslp_10m_winds`` is a mean-sea-level PRESSURE analysis with
#: 10 m barbs drawn over it, so ``--products wind10 --engine rust``
#: returned a pressure chart to anyone who asked for wind, while the
#: matplotlib engine's own ``wind10`` drew a genuine wind map.  During a
#: wildfire that asymmetry is what pushed an operator onto the fallback
#: engine to get a wind map at all.  The rust catalog now carries a real
#: standalone wind chart and this points at it.
#:
#: Any other token is passed through as a raw catalog slug, which the
#: renderer validates strictly (see :func:`parse_products_rust`).

    series of 20 frames (17 baselines, 3 wanted, every product): 17.7 s
    drawing every frame, 6.2 s for three single-frame launches, and the

    moved to never delivered it; the single-frame launches draw it at

    A series with context frames exists so a windowed product has its

    at 1 km (414x402) on the 5070 Ti host, about 6 s per frame to import
    against 3.5 s to draw one frame's 204 pictures, so one launch per
    wanted frame won only when a single frame was wanted.  A later launch
    into the same store now reuses the first one's import, but it still
    reads and hashes every frame of the series to find it, so the rule
    is kept until that cost is measured against drawing the baselines.

    Every NAMED slug whose catalog row is not ``renderable`` is dropped
    here and reported as a skip carrying the engine's own reason.  The
    catalog is asked about exactly the files this invocation is about to
    render -- one file on the per-file route, the whole series store on
    the series route -- so its verdict is not a guess about a different
    store, and Python computes no time axis, no accumulation and no
    field list of its own.

    WHAT BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS (gate law).  A named slug the catalog
    has refused, forwarded to the renderer anyway, is not skipped by it:
    ``rusty-weather``'s batch lane turns an unavailable window into
    ``ItemFailed``, and ``rw_wrfbatch`` exits nonzero when
    ``summary.failed > 0`` -- one product takes the WHOLE invocation
    down.  On the downscale route that invocation is the finalize render
    of a finished child, so six hours of integration ended with
    "Forecast failed" and a partial picture tree.

    This used to drop window-axis rows by matching two of the engine's
    English sentences.  The catalog has had FIVE windowed outcomes
    (``rw-wrfbatch/src/main.rs``): excluded on the whole-hour axis,
    excluded on the ordinal axis (renderers built before 2.8.0, which
    refused windows on a sub-hourly history), renderable, ``blocked``
    with a per-slug reason, and excluded because the window compute
    itself was unavailable -- whose sentence is composed at run time and
    can never be in a frozen set.  Two of five matched, and only while the wording
    held.  Matching on the STATUS matches all five and every status the
    catalog grows later, which is why the verdict is asked of
    :func:`woof.rustwx.catalog_verdict` rather than spelled again here.

    A token with no catalog row passes through untouched: the group
    keywords name no row and the engine expands them itself, leaving out
    what it cannot draw.  A non-empty request that is ONLY group
    keywords is returned unchanged without asking, because there is no
    named promise in it to check; an EMPTY request is not, and comes
    back empty so the caller refuses rather than running an empty
    render.

    The three STORELESS families are dropped first, by
    :func:`woof.rustwx.drop_storeless_terms` and before anything is
    launched: a store listing cannot decide a ``mesh:``, ``meshdiff:``
    or ``xsec:`` term, and the renderer answers one it cannot draw by
    refusing the whole invocation.  Doing it here rather than only at
    the front door covers every caller of this render path, and costs a
    mesh-only request no catalog listing it could not have used.

    Corrupt metadata and every other native refusal keep the original
    request, so the import/launch failure stays visible.

    campaign convention).  The scratch store lives under the output
    directory and is removed as soon as the file's render finishes.

    ``overlays``/``annotate`` are JSON files in the renderer's own

    sites and range rings, on a panel the production renderer drew.
    Omitted, the renderer runs no overlay code and the PNGs are

    theme file in the engine's own schema
    (``tools/rustwx/crates/rustwx-render/src/theme.rs``): the surface,
    the inks, the basemap linework, the colorbar chrome, the fonts and
    the colormap overrides, as one file.  Omitted, the engine draws its
    own look and the PNGs are byte-identical to every earlier build.
    ``section`` is the line ``xsec:`` products are cut along
    (``lat,lon,lat,lon`` or a JSON file), ``isotherms`` the isotherm set
    drawn on them, ``section_across_km`` an optional second frame across
    the line, ``section_top_km`` the ceiling of the fitted height range
    (1-40 km; the engine's own 14 km when none is named, which is why a
    shallow feature used to occupy the bottom fourteenth of every
    published cut).

    ``fills``, when a list is given, collects the range each vertical
    cut's colour bar was drawn over and the rule that set it, for the
    receipt.  A section's bar is fitted to its own frame at both ends,

    saw the stage fail is the one place that knows the render is over, so

    failure is how evidence disappears.

    ``prefix`` IS THE OWNERSHIP TEST, and a door passes the token it

    one delivery each keep their own store and none removes another's,

    the interleaving it misses (a second render whose store opens just

    A store under the plain prefix is therefore never swept by a door,

    two paragraphs up, one keyword away.  It is somebody's live render or
    an earlier crash's leavings, and ``woof render`` typed directly
    cleans up after itself.

    THE single answer to "is this renderer usable", and the only one.
    Both seams that can launch the engine read it -- :func:`_resolve_engine`
    for the CLI, :func:`render_wrfouts_rust` for every in-process caller
    (``woof go``'s first-products leg, the DA gallery) -- so a renderer
    can never be usable at one seam and foreign at the other.  Two
    independently correct gates landed here in one release and would
    have been exactly that: two definitions of usable, diverging on the
    first case they disagreed about.

    Two questions, in the order a reader wants them answered:

    * THE CONTRACT (task #106).  :func:`woof.rustwx.probe_renderer`
      runs ``--help``, then the ``--abi`` handshake against
      :data:`woof.rustwx.RENDERER_ABI_MARKER`.  This is the decisive
      one, because it is a statement about the BINARY's own answer
      rather than about where it sits: two builds of ``rw_wrfbatch``
      with different md5s both passed the old ``--help``-only probe and
      both reported ``verified``, and a build predating the handshake
      says ``unknown option --abi`` on exit 2.
    * THE PROVENANCE (task #125).
      :func:`woof.provenance_gate.renderer_bridge_refusal` refuses a
      binary that answers the contract correctly and still belongs to
      another tree -- the case the handshake cannot see, because a
      sibling checkout at the same contract version answers it
      perfectly.  ``find_renderer`` returns the first candidate that is
      a file and its last candidate is ``~/.woof/bridges``, a directory
      every woof on the machine writes into and none of them owns, so
      "nobody chose this binary" is a real and silent state.

    The reason is returned rather than raised, because what to DO about
    it belongs to the caller: ``auto`` degrades and says why, an
    explicit ``--engine rust`` refuses, and a direct in-process render
    has no fallback to offer at all.

    The action half also states what the skips mean for the exit code,
    and it must state it TRUTHFULLY in both arms.  With at least one
    image drawn (``wrote_any``), skips do not change the exit code and
    the notice says so.  With NOTHING drawn, the skips are exactly why
    the command exits nonzero (the deliberate ask-for-one-absent-product
    arm of the main dispatch), and the old reassurance -- "not a failure
    and does not change the exit code" -- was false there: a real user
    who requested ``lifted_index`` from a wrfout got rendered=0, exit 1,
    and a note insisting nothing had failed.  That arm now says nothing
    rendered and points at ``--list-products``, which prints the
    per-product verdict and reason for THIS file.

    ``drawn`` is the set of product folders this render DID fill.  With
    it, the note tells apart a product that drew no picture at all from
    one that was only skipped at some frames -- ``qpf_1h`` at F000, where
    no hour has ended yet -- because naming both the same way put a
    product with 24 pictures in the same sentence as three with none.

    Each name carries the first reason recorded for it, on the one line
    ``woof go`` relays, as :func:`woof.render_receipts.undrawn_note`
    gives the run's closing note.  The line used to give one fixed cause
    for every row, "the file(s) do not carry their declared input fields
    or required time windows", which is wrong for a frame too large for
    the renderer's pressure-level volume: that frame carries every field,
    and the engine's own note says the volume passed its ceiling.
