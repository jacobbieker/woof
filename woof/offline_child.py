"""Strict contracts for native offline parent-to-child downscaling.

This module is the file-facing half of woof's CUDA-native ``ndown``
replacement.  It deliberately separates cheap metadata validation from the
later GPU interpolation/build transaction: an archived parent series must be
proved complete, geometrically identical, regularly ordered, and sufficiently
frequent before any child state is allocated.

Both woof and stock-WRF history files are accepted.  The reader is closed
world for trajectory fields but tolerant of additional diagnostic variables.
Physics conversion is explicit.  In particular, active condensate may never
be paired with a fabricated zero number moment merely because the parent used
a different microphysics scheme.

    * both, and they agree -> a no-op;
    * both, and they disagree -> the flag wins as the later and more
      specific statement, and one warning names both modes.  A file that
      spells ``[tiles]`` mode = "off" out loud has declared a mode, so
      ``--tiles on|auto`` beside it is a disagreement and earns that
      warning; only the absence of the table is silence.
    * they disagree AND the file pins knobs the flag's mode cannot carry
      -> those knobs leave with the mode that could carry them, and the
      SAME one warning names them and both ways of keeping them.

    ``[tiles]`` binds no restart identity (``woof.core.streaming
    .identity_payload_entry`` returns nothing for it), so a mode
    disagreement is not a breakage to refuse over; it is a choice to
    resolve and say out loud.  The sibling front door
    (``woof.prepared_single_domain_forecast``) resolves the same
    disagreement in the same direction but NOT by the same test: it asks
    ``declared is not None and declared.enabled and declared != tiles``,
    so an experiment that spells ``[tiles] mode = "off"`` out loud is
    still replaced there without a word.  The identity test below is what
    keeps silence and an explicit off apart; that door needs the same one.

    again when a run of that shape ends the way this shape ends.  A
    second copy of the arithmetic is how the door and the refusal come to
    disagree about what regime a child was in.

    It is a STATEMENT and not a refusal.  A child at this spacing on an
    inherited ladder is a run somebody may very well want -- the shipped
    nested LES child is exactly one -- and nothing here changes what the
    run does.  What it changes is that the reader is told which regime
    they asked for before they wait for it, instead of afterwards.

    ``inherits_parent_levels`` is the caller's answer to "did anyone
    choose this child's vertical ladder?", because only the caller knows:
    the door knows whether ``--child-levels`` was given and whether the
    resolved ladder is still the parent's, and the runner knows what the
    door resolved.  ``parent_levels`` is the parent archive's own level
    count when the caller has it, and only sharpens the sentence.

    Returns ``None`` when the child is coarser than
    :data:`LES_CHILD_SPACING_M`, and otherwise when ALL THREE of these

      which is the scheme off and a two-dimensional closure
      (:data:`LES_CHILD_NO_VERTICAL_MIXING_CLOSURES`).

    always named and the rule once left out: an 83 m child on its own

    THE CLOSED LOOP THIS OPENS (defect #275).  A full-physics child needs
    child-grid land identity and soil state.  Until now the only way to
    supply it was ``--child-surface-from`` pointing at a file on the
    exact child grid, and for a config-driven parent -- the route the
    product steers ERA5 users onto -- no command in the product produced
    one: ``woof run`` writes no ``wrf-native-input/``, ``woof go``
    refuses ``[case_data]`` configs by name, and the prepared-tree route
    needs a front-door manifest the fetch door would only author for one
    source.  So the refusal demanded a file the product could not make,
    and said so only after the parent forecast had been paid for.

    The data was never missing.  The parent's history carries all nine of
    :data:`_SURFACE_REQUIRED_FIELDS` and the landuse identity attributes
    (:data:`woof.io.wrf_output_schema.SURFACE_IDENTITY_OUTPUT_FIELDS`,
    plus the LSM-gated soil family) whenever a land-surface scheme is
    routed -- which a full-physics parent by definition has.  Only the
    GRID was wrong, and putting a parent's surface state on a child grid
    is WRF's own operator, not new science: ``input_from_file = .false.``
    interpolates every field the nest needs from the coarse domain
    (Users' Guide chapter 5; ``med_nest_initial``'s unconditional
    ``med_interp_domain``, share/mediation_integrate.F:670), with the
    surface/soil family going through the Registry's landmask-aware
    ``interp_mask_field`` rather than a plain interpolator.

    WHAT IT COSTS, and why it is a default anyway.  The child inherits
    the parent's land identity at the parent's spacing, which is strictly
    less than a geogrid-built child-grid ``wrfinput`` gives.  It is also
    exactly what a live WRF nest with no input file of its own gets, and
    the product already takes this route for trigger-spawned nests
    (:func:`woof.ingest.nest_spawn_init.spawn_land_state_from_parent`).
    A refusal that names no reachable remedy is not a safeguard; this is
    the reachable remedy, ``--child-surface-from`` stays the
    higher-fidelity one, and the difference is warned about at the front
    door and receipted in the child's report.
