"""The NetCDF read path: Rust decode, Python interpretation.

Every NetCDF meteorological source woof reads is decoded by the
``rw_netcdf`` bridge (``tools/rustwx/crates/rw-netcdf``, built on the
vendored pure-Rust ``netcrust`` facade).  Python resolves selectors,
checks contracts and assembles frames; it does not decode the file.

This module used to have no reason to exist: :mod:`woof.mapped_source`
opened arbitrary third-party NetCDF with ``netCDF4.Dataset`` -- the C
library -- while ``netcrust`` sat vendored in the same tree, already
driven by ``rw_wrfbatch``, ``rw_sat`` and ``rw_fieldcmp`` for exactly
this job.  The GRIB half of the very same module had always shelled out
to ``grib2_inventory`` / ``grib2_dump``.  The two formats now go through
one idiom.

The surface below is deliberately shaped like the small part of the
``netCDF4`` API that the mapping decoder actually used -- ``.variables``,
``.dimensions``, attribute access, ``variable[:]`` -- so the selector and
contract logic above it is untouched.  What changed underneath is who
reads the bytes.

There is NO fallback to a Python NetCDF library.  A missing bridge is a
named refusal (:class:`NetcdfBridgeMissing`) carrying the exact command
to fix it, because a silent degradation into a second decoder is how two
readers drift apart without anyone noticing.
