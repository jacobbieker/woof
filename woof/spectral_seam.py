"""The one seam between Arwen's slow-step loop and the Level-2 operators.

WHERE THE HOOK FIRES.  ``woof.core.model.execute_experiment`` owns the
authoritative slow-large-step commit point: its STEP op calls the domain's
stepper (``dycore.step`` itself, or a ``StreamedDomain`` with the same
signature) and then refreshes the state clock from exact integer ticks
(``refresh_model_time(..., after_step=True)``).  That refresh is the commit;
the seam call sits immediately after it, inside the same domain turn, once
per domain per model time step -- after the RK slow-mode state is final,
never inside an acoustic substep, before health validation, output, nest
feedback or the next large step.  The 2026-08-17 survey of the current tree
(docs/handoffs/CURRENT-CORE-SPECTRAL-SEAM-SURVEY.json) records exactly this
anchor; the delivered survey the package promised was lost with its empty
patch, so the seam was re-derived from the live sources.

CONTRACTS HELD HERE (the operator package holds the arithmetic ones):

- absent/off pays one ``is None`` test in the loop and reads no state;
- a streamed domain refuses an active mode: its ``node.state`` is the t=0
  attach snapshot, the forecast lives in the pinned host store, so the
  complete target planes are NOT resident at the hook seam -- shadow would
  receipt the initial condition under later timestamps and apply would
  mutate planes the sweep never reads back.  The sentence lives in ONE
  place, :func:`streamed_spectral_refusal`.  ONE door reads it today, and
  it is a late one: :meth:`SpectralSeam.validate_domain` raises it at
  attach.  :func:`refuse_streamed_spectral_numerics` answers the same
  question from the configuration alone, out of that same sentence, but
  NO caller invokes it -- not in this module, not anywhere in the tree --
  so plan review carries no refusal for this combination and attach is
  the only door standing.  The three call sites that would change that
  are outside this lane's boundary and are handed back, with their exact
  lines, on the strict xfail in ``tests/test_spectral_seam.py``
  (``test_plan_review_carries_the_streamed_spectral_sentence``):
  ``_streaming_refusal`` in ``woof/runplan.py``, the shared config-load
  door in ``woof/experiment.py``, and ``woof check`` in
  ``woof/core/preflight.py``.  One residue stays genuinely late even
  after those land, and is not hoistable: a spawn-born nest joins after
  the plan is reviewed, and under ``[tiles] mode = "auto"`` its
  streamed-ness is the planner's run-time answer, so that domain is
  validated at its first committed step (:meth:`after_step`) with the
  same sentence;
- a periodic declaration must be true of the domain: ``periodic_domain``
  (and the ``periodic`` boundary) refuse on any domain with open,
  specified or nested lateral boundaries;
- receipts are counted per domain and bound into the run capsule, and a
  completed run whose ``apply`` receipts are missing refuses a clean
  completion capsule (:meth:`SpectralSeam.require_complete`).
