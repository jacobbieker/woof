"""Publish the experiment TOML a programmatic preparation actually used.

Some preparation routes build their :class:`ExperimentConfig` in code
rather than reading a config file: the native HRRR route derives every
domain and physics control from the target-domain document, the WRF
namelist and the selected physics profile, and hands the resulting
tables straight to :func:`woof.experiment.build_experiment`.  That is
the right shape for a preparer -- there is no file for a user to get
wrong -- but it leaves the STAGE AFTER IT with nothing to bind.

A prepared-cache identity contains ``domain_config``, compared by
strict equality on roughly a hundred and ten run fields.  A downstream
runner that has to supply an experiment config for the same case can
either be handed one that provably round-trips to what the preparation
used, or it can be hand-matched field by field and quietly refused
months later on a default nobody remembers changing.  This module is
the first option: the preparation renders the exact tables it built,
writes them, reads them back through the ordinary front door, and
refuses to publish if the reloaded domain identity is not identical.

The renderer is deliberately narrow.  It accepts the value types an
experiment document actually holds -- bool, int, float, str, datetime
and homogeneous lists of those -- and raises on anything else rather
than quoting it, because a number emitted as a string reads as valid
TOML under the right key and is not what was computed.

    The proof is the point.  ``prepared_domain_config_identity`` is what
    a prepared cache stores and what every restore compares, so
    comparing exactly that -- per domain -- is comparing the thing that
    will be checked, not a proxy for it.  A mismatch refuses and leaves
    no file behind: publishing a document that does not reload would
    hand the next stage an authority that fails at its front door with a
    message about the user's config.

    The VERTICAL grid is compared too, and separately, because it is not
    in the domain identity: ``eta_levels``, ``p_top`` and their hybrid
    controls live on the experiment, so a document that reloaded with a
    different ladder would pass a domain-identity comparison and then
    run a different model.  The start time is compared for the same
    reason -- it dates every forcing frame and is not a domain field.
