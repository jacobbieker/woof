"""One answer to "which tree is executing", for every entry point.

A version number cannot answer that question, and this project has now
paid for the difference more than once.

  * ``woof.__version__`` is read from distribution METADATA.  Metadata
    is a claim made by a ``.dist-info`` directory, not by the code that
    is running.  Measured on the reference box: an editable
    ``gpuwm-1.8.7`` dist-info points at one source tree while a worktree
    elsewhere serves the imports -- and ``woof.__version__`` cheerfully
    reports ``1.8.7`` to the worktree's process.  The number is not
    wrong so much as it is *borrowed*: it describes a different tree.
  * A bare ``python -c "import woof"`` run from a source directory
    imports THAT directory and reports whatever metadata it can find.
    Two false version readings came from exactly this.
  * A user reports plots labelled 1.6.2 while believing they installed
    1.8, and until this module existed there was no way to tell them
    whether the label was accurate.

So :func:`resolve` answers the five things a version number cannot, for
the process that is asking:

  1. WHERE the imported ``woof`` package actually lives on disk;
  2. WHAT KIND of install that is -- a wheel, an editable install, or a
     plain source tree;
  3. its git identity when it is a checkout -- branch, short sha, and
     whether the working tree is dirty;
  4. the version distribution metadata reports;
  5. the version the CODE itself declares, and whether the two AGREE.

Point 5 is the one that matters.  The other four describe an install;
only the fifth catches an install that is lying about itself, which is
the failure that has actually cost this project runs.

Reuse, not a fifth mechanism.  This project already resolves pieces of
this in several places and they stay authoritative:
:func:`woof.runtime_manifest.provenance` is still the receipt-binding
identity ladder (sealed manifest, then checkout, then wheel RECORD),
:func:`woof.runtime_manifest.git_checkout_root` is still the one
"is this a checkout of THIS tree" predicate -- reused below, including
its refusal of a venv nested in somebody else's repository -- and
:func:`woof.runtime_manifest.wheel_record_identity` is still how a
wheel's bytes are bound.  What was missing was a single cheap resolver
that names the running tree in one call, and one place where the
metadata-versus-code question is asked at all.

Cost and safety.  Two short subprocesses at most (git is asked exactly
one question, ``status --porcelain=v2 --branch``, which carries the
branch, the commit and the dirt together), one small TOML read, and the
answer is cached for the life of the process.  Nothing here imports
numpy, cupy, or any ingest module, so a startup banner can call it
before anything heavy loads.  Nothing here raises: a machine with no
git, a wheel with no repository, an unreadable ``pyproject.toml`` and a
half-removed install are all normal, and each degrades to a stated
absence rather than an exception on somebody's first run.

    It has to be generalised because ``locate_file`` cannot answer for
    an editable install, and answers *confidently wrong*.  A PEP 660
    editable puts no package in ``site-packages`` -- a ``.pth`` redirects
    the import elsewhere -- so ``locate_file("woof/__init__.py")``
    returns a ``site-packages`` path that does not exist.  Measured on

    ``...site-packages/woof/__init__.py``, a file that is not there.
    ``installed_distribution()`` therefore returns ``None`` for EVERY
    editable install, including one that is serving the running import,
    and the caller concludes "no installed distribution provides this
    code" about a distribution that provides exactly this code.
