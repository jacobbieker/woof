"""Controls the instrument must pass before any of its verdicts count.

A verification system that has never been shown to fail is not evidence; it
is a number generator with good manners.  Each control here is a deliberate
attempt to make the battery produce a *wrong* answer, and each one has a
registered criterion written before the data existed:

``persistence floor``
    every model arm must beat persistence beyond the early hours.  Failing
    this indicts the case or the scoring, not the model, and the record says
    so -- an arm that cannot beat "the radar an hour ago, forever" usually
    means the observation is misaligned, not that the forecast is worthless.

``wrong-day negative control``
    scoring a forecast against a different day's observations must collapse
    the score.  If it does not, the instrument is measuring climatology, the
    domain mask, or nothing at all.

``station-shuffle mutation``
    permuting station-to-gridpoint assignment must blow up surface RMSE.  If
    it does not, the matching code never actually read a location.

``regrid sensitivity``
    the same case scored under both registered remap operators.  The delta is
    published; the registered choice stands unless the delta exceeds the twin
    band, in which case it is re-registered once, before any campaign run.

``reflectivity-operator cross-check``
    the science core's own column-max reflectivity beside the stored
    ``REFL_10CM`` column max.  **This is a receipt, not a gate.**  The two
    operators are allowed to differ -- they are different operators -- and
    what matters is that the difference is measured and published rather than
    assumed away.

``twin non-degeneracy``
    the perturbed-twin pair must actually differ on the primary score.  A
    twin band of exactly zero measures nothing and would silently pass every
    chaos-floor clause, so a zero band escalates the perturbation instead of
    being published as a very tight bound.  This consumes a lesson already
    paid for once, where a one-ULP twin ensemble came out output-identical.

``determinism``
    every scored integration's dual-run byte pair is identical, and every
    observation re-hashes to the digest recorded at fetch.

Every criterion that needed a number takes it from the battery's own twin
band or its own useful-skill line rather than from a constant somebody
picked, so there is no invented threshold here to argue with.
