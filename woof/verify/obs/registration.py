"""Pins for the observation battery, hashed before any score is looked at.

This is the chaos-envelope registration discipline
(:mod:`woof.verify.chaos_envelope`) transplanted to obs scoring: every
parameter that could be chosen after seeing a result is chosen *here*, the
parameter block is canonically hashed, and the hash plus the evaluating
commit travel in every score file the battery writes.  A score whose
registration hash does not match the registration it is published beside is
not a score of that instrument.

Two things this module refuses to do:

* **It does not ratify its own numbers.**  The thresholds, the neighborhood
  set, the primary scalar, the significance level and the guardrail list are
  *proposals* until the project owner rules on them.  A registration built
  without an explicit ratification reference carries
  ``rule_status = "proposed-unratified"``, and the promotion evaluator
  refuses to call anything promoted under that status.  An instrument that
  ratifies its own gates measures its author.
* **It does not know a case.**  Case identity is data in the ``cases`` block
  -- ids, init instants, station-set digests -- and the scoring parameters
  above it are written in leads, thresholds and metres.  The same parameter
  block scores every case in the set, which is the only way the cross-case
  statistics in the promotion rule mean anything.

The ``DEFAULT_*`` values below transcribe the specification's proposals so a
caller does not retype them; they are defaults, not decisions, and the
``rule_status`` field is what says so.
