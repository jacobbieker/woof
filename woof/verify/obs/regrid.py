"""Putting an observation and a forecast on one grid, reproducibly.

Two remap operators, both registered, because the battery scores under one
and qualifies the choice against the other:

``nearest``
    every destination cell takes the value of the source cell whose centre is
    closest to it on the sphere.  Cheap, monotone, invents nothing -- and it
    is the registered operator for reflectivity, where the quantity is a
    maximum rather than an average and smoothing it would be a physical
    statement nobody made.

``cell_average``
    every destination cell takes the mean of the source cells that fall in
    it, where "fall in it" is spelled as "whose nearest destination centre is
    this one".  For a locally uniform destination grid that partition is the
    destination cells' footprints, so the operator conserves the field's mean
    over any union of destination cells whose sources are all valid -- the
    budget-style alternative the qualification receipt measures the registered
    choice against.

Three properties this module exists to keep:

* **The plan is data, computed once.**  A remap between two fixed grids is a
  fixed integer mapping.  Building it once per case and reusing it across
  arms is not only faster, it is what makes the arms comparable: every arm is
  remapped by the identical integer array, so no score can differ because a
  neighbour search broke a tie differently.
* **Distance is bounded and the bound is enforced.**  A destination cell with
  no source centre within ``max_distance_m`` is marked *invalid*, not filled
  from far away.  Without that, a domain corner outside the observation's
  coverage silently borrows the nearest edge observation and gets scored.
* **Validity is remapped with the values.**  A destination cell built only
  from invalid sources is invalid.  Missing does not become zero at a grid
  change.

Geometry is done on the unit sphere in Cartesian coordinates, so longitude
wrapping and the poles are not special cases; distances are converted between
great-circle and chord form with :data:`EARTH_RADIUS_M`.

**Where the arithmetic runs.**  WOOF's Python boundary names
"regrid/transform" as data-path processing, so both halves of this module
run on the Rust crate ``tools/rustwx/crates/obs-regrid`` by default,
reached through :mod:`woof.obs_regrid_bridge`.  The bodies below
stay as the parity reference the crate's goldens are extracted from, and
as an explicit fallback (``WOOF_OBSREGRID_PYTHON=1``) that announces
itself as a workaround.

The two engines agree bit for bit on real observation and model grids --
the crate's parity suite compares IEEE bit patterns, not tolerances, on
goldens this module produced -- with exactly one documented divergence.
When two source cells are exactly equidistant from one destination cell,
``cKDTree`` returns whichever the traversal reached first (measured: 232
of 400 trials returned the lowest index, 168 returned another), while
the Rust engine defines the answer as the lowest flat source index.
That is deliberate rather than a parity failure: this module's own
premise, three paragraphs up, is that every arm is remapped by the
identical integer array so no score can differ because a neighbour
search broke a tie differently, and a tie resolved by traversal order is
that defect waiting for a library upgrade.
