"""Does the mandated science core read a history tape the way we do?

The battery scores two models' output through one reader.  Every number it
will ever publish therefore rests on a premise nobody has measured: that
``wrf-rust`` opens a tape written by *either* writer and hands back the
values that are actually in the file.  A battery built on that premise
instead of on a receipt would report reader disagreement as forecast skill,
and nobody downstream could tell the two apart.

So this module measures the premise.  For one frame from each writer it
asks the science core for a registered quantity, derives the same quantity
from a plain NetCDF read, and records the difference.  Three properties
make the answer worth having:

* **The control is independent of the thing it controls.**  The control
  path opens the file with ``netCDF4`` and does its own arithmetic.  It
  never calls the science core -- an instrument that agreed because it
  asked the same code twice would measure nothing.  This is the single
  place in :mod:`woof.verify.obs` that computes a diagnostic quantity
  itself, and it exists only to be checked against.

* **The tolerances are mechanism-derived, not calibrated.**  A passthrough
  read and a maximum-over-a-column are exact operations: an FP32 value
  widened to FP64 is exact, and a maximum is one of its own inputs, so the
  registered tolerance is zero and no observation can move it.  The one
  derived quantity gets a tolerance bounded by its own arithmetic, quoted
  in the registration beside the reason.

* **The reader is pinned by distribution, not by hope.**  The receipt
  records which module answered, where it came from, and whether it is the
  mandated distribution version -- a receipt that cannot name its reader is
  not evidence, the same standard the evaluator commit is held to.

Two things the receipt is explicit about:

* the earth-rotation sign, which is **settled**.  Stored ``SINALPHA`` and
  ``COSALPHA`` carry ``alpha = cone * (STAND_LON - XLONG)``, positive west
  of the standard meridian, and the registered control is WRF's own
  ``earth_u``/``earth_v`` applied to exactly that angle.  A second lineage
  negates both the angle and the formula, which cancels to the identical
  rotation; there is no convention split to adjudicate.  The opposite-sign
  result is still computed and carried beside the scored one, but it is a
  **magnitude control on the sign, not a rival convention**: it prices what
  a sign error would cost on the domain being read.  The adjudication, its
  source citations and its geometric ground truth are the rotation addendum
  under ``docs/public/receipts/obsbattery/``.

* reflectivity provenance.  The registered quantity is the column maximum
  of the *stored* ``REFL_10CM``, which is each model's own
  scheme-consistent operator.  The science core also offers a recomputed
  ``maxdbz``; it is a different operator, not a different read of this one,
  and it is not what this receipt scores.
