"""Contingency-table scores for a forecast against an observation.

The 2x2 table and the scores derived from it are textbook (Schaefer 1990,
*WAF* 5, 570-575, for ETS; Wilks 2011, *Statistical Methods in the
Atmospheric Sciences*, ch. 8, for the family).  The formulas already existed
in this tree inside a case-named lane comparator, where they could only ever
compare one campaign's two model arms.  They are re-stated here in a
mechanism-named module that takes its fields, its threshold and its validity
mask as arguments and knows nothing else -- so the same call scores a
forecast against radar, against a gauge analysis, or against another model.

Two deliberate properties:

* **An undefined score is ``None``, never zero.**  POD with no observed
  events is not "zero detection", it is a question the day did not ask.
  Publishing zero there would drag a case average toward a number nobody
  measured.
* **The observation is the first argument.**  Hits, misses and false alarms
  are asymmetric, and the argument order fixes which field is the referee.
