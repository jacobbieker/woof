"""The promotion evaluator: four clauses, and none of them self-ratified.

A patch is promoted to the model's default only when all four registered
clauses hold on the frozen case set:

``R1`` direction and significance
    a one-sided exact Wilcoxon signed-rank test on the per-case differences,
    against the direction registered *before* any data existed.  Exact, by
    enumerating the null distribution of the signed-rank sum over every sign
    assignment of the observed absolute ranks -- not a normal approximation,
    which at seven cases would be a fiction.  The accurate consequence is
    printed with every verdict: at n = 7 the smallest attainable p is 1/128,
    so this battery can certify consistent effects and nothing else.

``R2`` chaos floor
    the cross-case median improvement must exceed the twin band -- what the
    same score moves when two runs of the *same* model differ only by a
    perturbation too small to mean anything.  An improvement inside that band
    is recorded as indistinguishable from chaos and the patch stays a
    candidate.

``R3`` no-harm guardrails
    reflectivity skill may not be bought with a broken surface climate or
    broken precipitation.  Each guardrail has a registered direction, and a
    patch may not degrade the cross-case median of any of them by more than
    that metric's own twin band.

``R4`` integrity
    every scored integration passed its dual-run byte screen, every
    observation re-hashed to the digest recorded at fetch, every score file
    carries the registration hash and evaluator commit it claims -- and no
    stand-in input appears anywhere in the evidence.

And one thing this module will not do: call a patch promoted under a rule the
owner has not ratified.  A registration built without a ratification
reference produces verdicts labelled ``proposed-unratified``, with
``promoted`` false and the reason stated.  The arithmetic is still run and
still published; what is withheld is the authority, which was never the
evaluator's to grant.
