"""The data contract at the observation seam.

This module is the *seam*: everything the scorer knows about an observation
arrives through the types declared here, and nothing else.  The ingest lane
writes them, the scorer reads them, and the integration wave diffs exactly
this surface -- which is the point of writing it down before either side is
finished rather than discovering the mismatch in a score table.

Three rules the shapes here exist to keep:

* **The scorer never names a case.**  A case is an argument -- a case id
  string, a set of valid times, a station list, a grid -- carried in data.
  Nothing in this package branches on which case it is scoring, so the same
  scorer that scores a December nocturnal event scores a July derecho with no
  edit.  Same for the observation *source*: MRMS and Stage-IV are
  source-specific ingest concerns, and by the time bytes reach here they are
  "a gridded field on its own latitude/longitude with a validity mask".

* **Provenance travels with the values.**  Every field and every station set
  carries the archive object it came from and that object's SHA-256 at fetch,
  so the scoring pass can re-hash and refuse silently-mutated inputs (the
  promotion rule's integrity clause) without a side channel.

* **A stand-in can never be mistaken for an observation.**  Provenance carries
  ``is_stub``; a score file built from stubbed inputs records that fact, and
  the promotion evaluator refuses such evidence outright.  A quiet synthetic
  field that scores like a real one is the failure mode this flag exists to
  make impossible.

Units are pinned, in SI, at the seam.  A source that publishes Celsius or
inches converts on the ingest side; the scorer performs no unit inference,
because a scorer that guesses units eventually guesses wrong on the one case
nobody re-reads.
