"""The t=0 gap between the two engines, measured and published.

Both arms of the battery start from one analysis, and the battery's whole
claim rests on their starting from the *same* state.  The tree already owns
the instrument that measures a staged pair's initial state --
:mod:`woof.verify.t0_state_digest` -- and this module does not measure it
again.  It composes that digest into the receipt a campaign case ships, and
it changes exactly one thing about how the answer is read.

**The bit-parity gate does not apply across engines, and this module says so
instead of quietly failing.**  The digest's ceilings come from
:mod:`woof.verify.nest_gates`; they were pinned to hold one engine to its
own arithmetic, and a pair of *different* engines reading one analysis will
miss them for reasons that are not defects.  Two responses would be wrong.
Widening a ceiling is forbidden and would break every same-engine receipt
that ceiling protects.  Reporting the cross-engine FAIL as a defect would
bury the real number under a verdict that was never about this comparison.

So the gap is carried as a measurement: per carrier group, the largest
absolute difference any scored variable showed and the variable that showed
it, in the variables' own units, beside the digest's bit-parity verdict
recorded verbatim and marked non-binding.  The specification's instruction
for this comparison is that the t=0 gap is measured, published, and never
assumed; a receipt that graded it would be assuming the answer it was built
to report.

What this module *does* gate is whether the receipt is a t=0 receipt at all:

* every carrier group the digest requires must have scored something, and
* every scored frame must be the initial frame -- the file's own valid time
  against its own ``SIMULATION_START_DATE``.

A pair staged at the wrong lead scores perfectly well and answers a
different question, so it is refused rather than published under this name.
