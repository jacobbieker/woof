"""The scoring pass: one case, one arm, one small score file.

A campaign's history files are tens of gigabytes per run and do not survive
the campaign.  What survives is what this module writes: a megabyte-scale
document carrying every score, the registration hash it was computed under,
the evaluating commit, and the provenance of every observation that went into
it.  Score-then-delete only works if the score file is complete enough to
never need the wrfout again, so it is written that way.

The pass is arranged so that nothing about *which* case is being scored can
influence *how* it is scored:

* the registration supplies every parameter, and its hash travels with the
  output;
* the case supplies data -- an init instant, a model run, observation
  sources, a station set -- through the seam types;
* the same function scores the faithful arm, each patched arm, the other
  model, and the perturbed twin, because none of them is special here.

Spin-up leads are computed when asked for and filed under a key that says
they are reported and not scored.  They cannot reach the primary scalar: the
scored leads come from the registration, and the reported leads are a
separate argument that feeds a separate block.
