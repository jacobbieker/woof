"""Surface verification against point observations.

Scoring a grid against a scatter of stations is where a verification system
most easily fools itself, so every step that could quietly manufacture skill
is made explicit and receipted here:

* **The station set is frozen once per case and shared by every arm.**  A set
  chosen per arm -- even innocently, by dropping stations an arm happens to
  miss -- makes the arms unpaired, and an unpaired difference of medians is
  not a difference.  :func:`freeze_station_set` returns the survivors *and*
  every drop with its reason, and the harness records both.
* **A station is dropped, never corrected.**  When model terrain and station
  elevation disagree by more than the registered tolerance, the accurate move
  is to stop scoring that station; a lapse-rate adjustment would invent the
  agreement it is measuring.  The dropped count is published.
* **Time matching is one-sided about failure.**  A (station, hour) with no
  report inside the tolerance is missing for *every* arm, not just the arm
  that noticed.
* **Interpolation is registered, and the alternative is a control.**  The
  battery scores under bilinear interpolation of the model field to the
  station; nearest-neighbour exists here as the qualification sensitivity,
  not as a fallback that fires when bilinear is inconvenient.

Nothing here knows a case, a network, or a station id: the station list, the
masks and the tolerances all arrive as arguments.
