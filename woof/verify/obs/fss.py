"""Neighborhood fractions skill score against observations, with masks.

The arithmetic is Roberts & Lean (2008, *MWR* 136, 78-97) and the engine is
:mod:`woof.verify.field_metrics` -- the same boxcar and the same
``1 - FSS`` definition the model-vs-model lanes already use.  This module
adds the one thing scoring against observations needs and scoring against
another model does not: **a validity mask**.

Observed grids have holes.  MRMS flags cells the radar network cannot see,
the interior mask excludes the specified and relaxation rows plus a rim, and
neither hole may be scored as if it were a confident zero.  Zero is not
missing -- treating a masked cell as "no reflectivity" inflates agreement
wherever both fields are quiet for the same uninformative reason.

The masked formulation, registered:

* the scored validity is the **intersection** of the model's and the
  observation's validity, so both fields answer for the same cells;
* the neighborhood fraction at a cell is
  ``boxcar(event AND valid) / boxcar(valid)``, i.e. the event fraction
  *among the valid cells in the box*, not among all cells in the box;
* a cell whose box holds no valid cell at all is dropped from the sums;
* the FSS sums run over the scored region only, and the denominator
  convention matches the existing engine exactly: ``FSS = 1`` when both
  fraction fields are identically zero over the scored region.

With an all-true mask, an all-true scored region and the ``edge`` boundary
below, this reduces term for term to ``1 - field_metrics.fss_distance``;
``tests/test_obs_fss.py`` pins that identity rather than asserting it here.

One boundary property worth stating because it is essential and easy to
get quietly wrong.  :func:`woof.verify.field_metrics.boxcar` pads by edge
extension, which replicates the outermost row outward -- i.e. it assumes the
field continues past the domain.  For a model-vs-model comparison that is
harmless; against observations it is a claim that cells outside the domain
were observed, and at the widest registered neighborhood the scored region
does reach within one cell of the array edge.  So this module registers the
boundary treatment as a parameter:

``zero`` (the battery's registered choice)
    outside the array is not observed.  The arrays are explicitly zero-padded
    by the neighborhood half-width before the boxcar runs, so the padded ring
    contributes nothing to either the numerator or the denominator -- and
    because the denominator counts only valid cells, those padded cells drop
    out of the fraction entirely rather than diluting it.  A box straddling
    the edge reports the event fraction among the observations it actually
    contains.

``edge``
    the existing engine's own behavior, kept so the reduction to
    ``1 - field_metrics.fss_distance`` is exact and testable rather than
    approximate.
