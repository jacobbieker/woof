"""A dormant nest born out of a WK82 supercell, on the idealized route.

The spawn feature end to end on the path that can carry it today: the
real-data route reserves a dormant nest but cannot yet give a NEWBORN
its soil/land state (an open physics question, refused by name in
``woof.runtime.run_experiment``), while the idealized route attaches
physics through ``prepare_idealized_domain`` and therefore can.

The story this case tells, in one run of the shipped driver
(:func:`woof.runtime.walk_spawn_legs`):

1. the 1 km parent integrates ALONE while the supercell spins up -- the
   declared nest is priced from the first step and costs zero compute;
2. the storm's composite reflectivity crosses the trigger inside the
   watch window, and the nest is materialized from the LIVE parent at
   the storm-core centroid, whole-parent-cell aligned and clamped clear
   of the parent edge;
3. the 333 m child integrates its own substeps for the rest of the run,
   forced by its parent every parent step.

The zero-compute claim is measured, not asserted: the child's clock
step count at the end must equal exactly the steps between its birth
instant and the run end, so a nest that had been integrating all along
would fail the receipt.
