"""Mayfield, KY, 2021-12-10/11: the tornado-scale LES attempt #1 case.

This module is the case's home outside its TOML. Under the standing rule
that a case name reaches only its config and its case module, everything
about *which storm and which ground* attempt #1 integrates is pinned here
and nowhere else in the package.

It registers as a ``script`` capability, not ``verify``: the graded
screens live in ``docs/les/ATTEMPT1-EXPECTATIONS.md`` and are computed
from a completed run's outputs, so there are no ``GATES`` here to be
checked before one exists. What :func:`main` does instead is the one
check that is useful *before* the run and cheap enough to run in CI: it
re-derives the ratified pins from the shipped config and refuses if the
two have drifted apart.

That drift is a real failure mode. The ratifications live in
``docs/superpowers/specs/P6-LES-DECISIONS-RATIFIED-2026-08-05.md`` as
prose, the geometry lives in the TOML as numbers, and nothing else
connects them -- so a later edit to either could leave the run
integrating something the owner never ruled on, with both documents
still reading plausibly.

This case replaced a Dodge City 2016-05-24 pick on 2026-08-06. The
sibling module ``les_tornado_dodgecity_20160524`` and its config remain
in the tree, PARKED behind an unadjudicated ingest question; see that
module's docstring.

Run it::

    python -m woof.verify.cases.les_tornado_mayfield_20211210 --help
    python -m woof.verify.cases.les_tornado_mayfield_20211210
    python -m woof.verify.cases.les_tornado_mayfield_20211210 \\
        --config PATH/TO/les_tornado_100m_mayfield_20211210.toml

The config is a repository file under ``configs/``, which woof 2.5.0 and
later ship beside the package, so an install finds it with no argument.
Where it is missing -- an older install, or a config kept outside the
tree -- name it with ``--config`` or point ``WOOF_CONFIGS_ROOT`` at the
directory holding it; the refusal says so itself.
