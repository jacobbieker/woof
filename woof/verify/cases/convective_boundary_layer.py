# woof/verify/cases/convective_boundary_layer.py
"""Dry convective boundary layer under the km_opt=3 LES closure.

A doubly periodic, flat, dry free-convection case in the shape of WRF's
em_les reference (test/em_les: prescribed kinematic surface heat flux
driving a CBL, PBL off, diff_opt=2, double periodic, README.les), run
with the 3-D Smagorinsky closure this engine ports (km_opt=3,
mix_isotropic=1, c_s=0.18 -- the em_les-recommended constant) and the
prescribed-flux lower boundary (isfflx=0: constant tke_heat_flux heat,
constant tke_drag_coefficient drag, no moisture flux -- WRF
vertical_diffusion_2 CASE(0)).

Two entry points:

``run(outdir)`` -- the VERIFY smoke: a small short integration whose GATES
are validity-only (finite fields, bounded w and CFL, dry-mass closure on
the periodic domain).  The convective-statistics numbers (heat-flux
profile, z_i, resolved TKE) are computed and FILED in the metrics dict as
receipts, not gated: pass bands for LES statistics are measure-then-commit
against the WRF oracle per the LES program spec, and inventing them here
would calibrate gates to their own first measurement.

``main(argv)`` -- the sized LES driver: the full case (default 96 x 96 x
64 at dx = 100 m, two simulated hours) with periodic profile sampling,
writing one receipts JSON plus one compact npz (slab-mean profiles per
sample and a single final-state w slab) sized in kilobytes-to-megabytes,
never per-step 3-D history.
