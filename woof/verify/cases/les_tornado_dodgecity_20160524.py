"""Dodge City, KS, 2016-05-24: a PARKED tornado-scale LES case.

PARKED 2026-08-06, not withdrawn and not adjudicated. This was attempt
#1's case until it moved to Mayfield, KY 2021-12-10
(``les_tornado_mayfield_20211210``) specifically so that the HRRRv1
cloud-ice identity question would not need a ruling in order for the
attempt to proceed. The question is still open, the evidence for it is
measured and committed in ``docs/les/ATTEMPT1-INGEST-FINDING.md``, and no
alias was added to the native contract.

This module and its config stay in the tree so a future Dodge City
attempt starts from a ratified geometry rather than from scratch. The
audit below still runs and still passes; what it does NOT mean is that
the case is runnable, because the ingest route refuses the cycle.


This module is the case's home outside its TOML. Under the standing rule
that a case name reaches only its config and its case module, everything
about *which day and which ground* attempt #1 integrates is pinned here
and nowhere else in the package.

It registers as a ``script`` capability, not ``verify``: the graded
screens live in ``docs/les/ATTEMPT1-EXPECTATIONS.md`` and are computed
from a completed run's outputs, so there are no ``GATES`` here to be
checked before one exists. What :func:`main` does instead is the one
check that is useful *before* the run and cheap enough to run in CI: it
re-derives the ratified pins from the shipped config and refuses if the
two have drifted apart.

That drift is a real failure mode. The ratifications live in
``docs/superpowers/specs/P6-LES-DECISIONS-RATIFIED-2026-08-05.md`` as
prose, the geometry lives in the TOML as numbers, and nothing else
connects them -- so a later edit to either could leave the run
integrating something the owner never ruled on, with both documents
still reading plausibly.

Run it::

    python -m woof.verify.cases.les_tornado_dodgecity_20160524 --help
    python -m woof.verify.cases.les_tornado_dodgecity_20160524
    python -m woof.verify.cases.les_tornado_dodgecity_20160524 \\
        --config PATH/TO/les_tornado_100m_dodgecity_20160524.toml

The config is a repository file under ``configs/``, which woof 2.5.0 and
later ship beside the package, so an install finds it with no argument.
Where it is missing -- an older install, or a config kept outside the
tree -- name it with ``--config`` or point ``WOOF_CONFIGS_ROOT`` at the
directory holding it; the refusal says so itself.
