"""Locating a repository config, wherever this package is running from.

Some case modules are the *module half* of a case whose other half is a
TOML under the repository's top-level ``configs/`` directory.

Through 2.4.1 that directory was in no distribution at all: it is not a
package, and ``[tool.setuptools.packages.find]`` named only ``woof*``,
``tools`` and ``tilestream*``.  A case module that resolves its config as
``Path(__file__).parents[3] / "configs" / NAME`` therefore pointed at
``<site-packages>/configs/NAME`` after ``pip install recast-woof`` -- a path
that had never existed on any machine.  Reading it produced the generic
loader refusal *"... does not exist; pass the experiment .toml that
`woof domain` wrote"*, which is wrong twice over: the wizard does not
emit these configs, and the module that printed it accepted no path to
pass.

Since 2.5.0 ``configs`` ships as a top-level directory of the wheel and
the sdist, so ``<site-packages>/configs/NAME`` is exactly where the file
now is and this module's first-choice path is the one that resolves.  The
resolution ladder below is unchanged and still matters: an environment
that predates 2.5.0, a partial install, or a config a reader keeps outside
the tree all still land in the refusal path, which is why
:func:`shipped_in_wheel` asks the filesystem rather than trusting a
release note.

This module holds the one accurate answer.  :func:`locate` returns the
config when it is really there, and :func:`missing_config_message` builds
the refusal that names *why* it is not there and what the reader can
actually do, given the flag the calling module offers.  Nothing here
knows any case name -- the filename is always an argument.
