# woof/verify/cases/cloud_topped_boundary_layer.py
"""Cloud-topped convective boundary layer under an LES closure (moist P1).

The moist sibling of :mod:`woof.verify.cases.convective_boundary_layer`.
Same doubly periodic, flat em_les topology, same prescribed-flux lower
boundary (isfflx=0: constant ``tke_heat_flux`` heat, constant
``tke_drag_coefficient`` drag, and therefore **no surface moisture flux
at all**), same seeded IC perturbation on the lowest four levels -- with
Kessler warm rain (``mp_physics=1``) on top of a capped, conditionally
saturated sounding whose LCL sits inside the mixed layer.  The deck is
capped from above by a real inversion, so the cloud layer is set by the
flow rather than by the model lid.

Two entry points, the same pair the dry case exposes:

``run(outdir)`` -- the VERIFY smoke: a small short integration whose
GATES are validity-only (finite fields, bounded w and CFL, dry-mass
closure on the periodic domain).  Cloud, buoyancy-flux and engagement
statistics are computed and FILED as receipts, never gated: LES bands
are measure-then-commit against the oracle, and the moist acceptance
criteria that exist today (AC-CAP.2/3/4) were cut from the *oracle's*
own draws and are not this engine's to inherit.

``main(argv)`` -- the sized LES driver: the matched 100 m configuration
(96 x 96 x 64 at dx = 100 m, ztop 2400 m, dt 0.5 s, two simulated hours,
one profile sample per minute), writing one receipts JSON plus the
same-instrument npz.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE CASE DEFINITION, AND WHERE IT COMES FROM
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The sounding is the ratified P1 reference: the capped moist matched
family, 8.0 K cap over 150 m with its base at 1500 m, qv 14.0 / 5.6
g/kg stepping at the same 1500 m.  Provenance, the decider that selected
it over the qv-12 fallback and over the 20 K cap probe, and the AC-CAP
acceptance record (v1 and the v2 registered beside it) are in
``docs/superpowers/receipts/les/MOIST-CASE-REFERENCE-SETTINGS.md`` §6 and
``docs/superpowers/receipts/les/wrf-moist-capped-decider-2026-08-04.md``.

The oracle initialises from a WRF ``input_sounding`` asset.  This module
reproduces that asset *exactly* -- see :func:`sounding_text`, pinned to
sha256 ``993fedb1...`` -- and interpolates from its own rounded columns,
so both engines read the same numbers rather than two spellings of the
same intent.  The rounding matters: the asset is written ``%10.2f``, and
that is what ``ideal.exe`` reads.

**AC-CAP.1 v2 applies to every windowed statistic this case reports.**
The capped family is accepted as NON-STATIONARY on geometric criteria
only; a receipt quoting a windowed moist statistic must say the window
is not stationary and give the LWP trend beside it.  ``lwp_trend_pct_per_h``
is on the receipt for exactly that reason.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
READ THIS BEFORE COMPARING z_i: ONE NAME, TWO HEIGHTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quoted from the npz contract at the head of
``tools/wrf_em_les_oracle/same_instrument_moist.py``, because the
reduction it governs is implemented here in
:func:`reduce_moist_profiles`:

    ``zi_thetav_m`` here -- and ``zi_thetav_load_m`` in the WRF receipts
    -- is the height of the MINIMUM of the total buoyancy flux.  In a
    **clear** CBL that is the inversion.  In a **cloud-topped** CBL it is
    **cloud base**, because the buoyancy flux reverses there.  This is not
    a modelling choice and not a bug; it is what the definition does, and
    it was measured on two runs of the same capped family that differ
    only in their vapour column:

        capped-DRY   anchor : zi = 1526.3 m   (the inversion, base at 1500 m)
        capped-MOIST r1     : zi = 1274.4514 m
                              cloud_base_m = 1274.4514 m   <- the same number,
                                                              to every digit

    So a moist-vs-dry z_i difference is NOT a change in boundary-layer
    depth, and comparing a cloudy WOOF z_i against a clear WRF z_i (or
    the reverse) compares two different heights while appearing to
    compare one quantity.  Both sides must reduce it identically, and any
    receipt quoting z_i for a cloudy case must say which of the two it
    means.  The inversion height in a cloudy case is not recoverable from
    this metric; use ``cloud_top_m`` or the theta profile.

``tests/test_les_moist_instrument.py`` holds :func:`reduce_moist_profiles`
bit-identical to the oracle's ``reduce_moist`` on the banked oracle
fixtures, so the two sides cannot drift into reducing different
quantities under one name.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE npz CONTRACT
------------------------------------------------------------------------
:func:`write_moist_npz` emits every array the oracle reducer requires,
under the oracle's names and shapes (nz mass levels, nz+1 w levels, nt
frames):

  z_mass (nz,)  t_seconds (nt,)  wthv_res (nt,nz)  wthv_sgs (nt,nz+1)
  wqv_res (nt,nz)  wqv_sgs (nt,nz+1)  qv qc qr theta thetav (nt,nz)
  cloud_frac sat_frac n2_moist_frac (nt,nz)  lwp (nt,)

plus the optional carriers ``e_sgs`` (km_opt=2 only; an all-zero array is
read as an ABSENT carrier), ``rwp``, ``rainnc``, the ``*_novload``
theta_v variants so a convention disagreement can be measured rather than
argued, and ``z_w``.

theta_v convention, matching the oracle: ``theta*(1 + EP_1*qv - qc - qr -
qi)``, condensate loading included, with ``EP_1 = RV/RD - 1`` evaluated in
float64.  Note that this is deliberately NOT
``woof.core.constants.RVOVRD - 1``: RVOVRD is WRF's float32 divide (the
engine's EOS spelling, ``constants.py:36-45``) and lands a ULP away.  The
instrument must match the *instrument's* spelling on both sides; the
engine's internal EOS convention is a separate, engine-internal matter.
