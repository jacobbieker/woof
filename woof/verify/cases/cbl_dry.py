"""Dry convective boundary layer: one closure against another.

A flat, horizontally homogeneous, dry column set under a surface warmer
than the air above it.  The surface layer converts that contrast into a
positive heat flux, the boundary-layer closure mixes it upward, and a
well-mixed layer grows into the overlying stable stratification.  This
is the oldest and least ambiguous boundary-layer test there is: the
answer has a known SHAPE (a near-adiabatic mixed layer capped by an
inversion that rises through the morning) even where no reference run
exists to compare against number by number.

Why it is in the tree
---------------------
It is the smallest configuration in which two boundary-layer schemes can
be asked the same question and their answers laid side by side.  The
gates below therefore check VALIDITY -- did the closure produce a
physically admissible boundary layer at all -- and deliberately do NOT
encode a preferred profile.  A scheme that mixes more deeply than
another is not thereby wrong, and this case is not the instrument that
would decide it.

Both the WRF-transcribed schemes and the experimental ArWen-only closure
can drive it, selected exactly as a user selects them: through
``bl_pbl_physics``.  ``run`` executes one closure and returns its gate
metrics; ``compare`` runs two and returns both metric sets plus the
profile pair, which is what makes the side-by-side readable.

Setup
-----
Doubly periodic 16 x 16 columns at dx = 500 m, 40 levels to 2 km
(dz ~ 50 m), initial theta 300 K with a 3 K/km stable lapse rate, at
rest apart from a light 2 m/s geostrophic-scale wind so the surface
layer has a shear scale to work with, land surface at a fixed 305 K --
5 K warmer than the air it touches.  Two hours of model time.  No
moisture, no radiation, no cumulus: the only thing moving heat upward is
the boundary-layer closure under test, which is the point.

#:
#: ``nan`` is deliberately NOT a gate row: the driver checks it first
#: and by itself, and the returned metrics carry it beside the gate keys
#: (the case-registry contract).  Gates here are OPEN intervals with
#: strict bounds, ``lo < v < hi``, which is why a zero-valued metric can
#: never be gated with a zero bound.
#:
#: * ``theta_surface_warming`` -- the surface heat flux reached the air.
#:   A closure that mixes nothing leaves this at zero.
#: * ``mixed_layer_depth`` -- an adiabatic layer formed and is bounded by
#:   the domain.  The lower bound rejects "no boundary layer at all"; the
#:   upper rejects a layer that has run away through the model top.
#: * ``theta_gradient_aloft`` -- the stable stratification above the
#:   mixed layer SURVIVED.  This is the gate that catches a closure
#:   mixing the whole column indiscriminately, which is the classic
#:   failure and is invisible in a depth check alone.
#: * ``wind_speed_max`` -- momentum stayed bounded; surface drag did not
#:   run away or reverse.
#: * ``surface_heat_consistency`` -- the column's integrated heat GAIN,
#:   divided by an independent bulk-aerodynamic estimate of what the
#:   surface could have delivered over the run (C_H |V| dTheta t, with
#:   C_H |V| = 0.02 m/s at this case's 2 m/s wind).  Order unity is the
#:   correct answer and the band says so: near zero means the closure
#:   moved no heat off the surface, and far above one means it created
#:   heat the surface never supplied.  The band is deliberately a factor
#:   of a few wide -- the denominator is an estimate, not a budget, and
#:   this gate is here to catch a broken energy path, not to score one
