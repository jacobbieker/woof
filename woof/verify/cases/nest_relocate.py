"""Executable proof of discrete nest relocation on the idealized r3 tree.

The case borrows the N2c ratio-3 WK82 geometry
(:mod:`woof.verify.cases.nest_ideal_r3`) and shortens it: what is under
test is the re-grid at a cycle boundary, not the two-hour storm.  It runs
one short leg to give the child some fine-scale structure of its own, then
performs two relocations on the resulting tree and scores five components.

WHY BOTH DIRECTIONS.  A move test that only checks "the overlap matches"
cannot tell a correct shift from no shift at all, so every component here
is paired with something that must fail if the mechanism is wrong:

1. ``null_move_bit_identity`` -- moving to the SAME placement must leave
   the child bitwise identical.  This is the calibration point: it is the
   one relocation whose answer is known in advance, and it exercises the
   whole path (cold start, donor check, transplant, RK reseed, coupler
   rebuild) rather than short-circuiting.  The state digest alone would
   be partly circular, since at zero shift the stamp covers exactly the
   fields the digest covers, so the component ALSO compares the state the
   transplant does not write: the SINT base state and the map factors,
   which a null move recomputes from scratch and must reproduce exactly,
   and the RK time-t copies, which are checked against WRF
   ``start_domain``'s post-condition rather than against their pre-move
   values -- they are per-step scratch that ``dycore.step()`` rewrites
   before reading, which is why the restart contract excludes them.
2. ``parent_bitwise_unchanged`` -- the parent's serialised state digest,
   taken around each relocation.  A re-grid reads the parent; if it ever
   writes one, the registered non-mutating-coupling property is gone.
3. ``overlap_bit_identity`` -- on the ground the child still covers, the
   moved child must equal the outgoing child shifted in index space,
   bitwise, on every field of the restart contract.  Measured against a
   HOST copy taken before the move, so the comparison cannot be satisfied
   by the same device buffer being read twice.
4. ``donor_alignment`` -- the child's SINT-derived base state must agree
   bitwise on the overlap.  This is computed by the SINT operator and not
   by the shift arithmetic, so it is an independent witness that the two
   placements really do share donor cells.
5. ``post_move_integration`` -- the relocated tree integrates a second leg
   with the health validator armed, finite everywhere, and no boundary
   blow-up. A re-grid that produced a plausible-looking but unbalanced
   child shows up here rather than in a norm.

The strip left behind by the move is NOT expected to match anything: it is
freshly interpolated from the parent and is the spin-up cost the placement
policy exists to keep small.  It is reported, never asserted away.
