"""FP64 reference authority for the SASE-L1 dry turbulence core.

Design: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-20-sase-design.md.  This module is
the stage-1/2 evidence-ladder artifact: a NumPy, float64, CPU-only
implementation of the SASE-L1 sensor, dynamic closure, stress model, and
subgrid-energy budget on a horizontally periodic box.  The eventual CUDA
production implementation is gated against this module; nothing here may
import cupy or woof.core.kernels.

Array layout is woof's standard ``(nz, ny, nx)`` with x fastest.
Constants are Deardorff-synthesis values (spec section 10); the claimed
novel elements are the dynamic partition solve and the exact discrete
energy ledger, not these coefficients.

S3-6b amendment: anisotropic mixing lengths + implicit vertical
diffusion.  The v0 explicit step ``sase_ref_step`` uses the horizontal
filter scale for VERTICAL diffusion with explicit stepping, which is
linearly unstable on coarse domains (outer nest: delta = 12 km, dz1 ~ 50 m,
dt = 60 s gives 2*nu*dt/dz^2 = O(10^2) once sqrt(e) ~ 1; see
``physics._run_sase``).  S3-6c completed the retirement: the device
explicit path and its gates are gone, the device split step mirrors
:func:`sase_split_step`, and ``sase_ref_step`` stays bit-frozen as the
v0 historical authority with NO device consumer.  The amended
authority is :func:`sase_split_step`:

* Vertical mixing length: l_v = min(l_B, LS_COEF*sqrt(e)/N) on the
  N^2 > 0 branch, with the Blackadar (1962) neutral form
  l_B = k*(z+z0)/(1 + k*(z+z0)/lambda), lambda = BLACKADAR_LAMBDA
  = 150 m, k = KARMAN.  Vertical diffusivity K_v = C_KV*l_v*sqrt(e)
  with C_KV = C_E**(1/3) (log-layer consistency; derivation at the
  constant).  The dynamic weights (c_nu, f) deliberately do NOT enter
  K_v: the Germano identity is built from horizontal test filters
  (spec 4.1), so its weights calibrate the horizontal channel only,
  and a (c_nu, f)-free K_v preserves the exact log-layer constant and
  keeps the implicit coefficients per-column data.  f DOES enter the
  dissipation-length regime blend (:func:`dissipation_length`):
  l_d = min(delta**f * l_B**(1-f), l_s) -- GEOMETRIC since S3-9
  (originally the linear f*delta + (1-f)*l_B; the S3-9 section has
  the change and its evidence) -- recovering the v0 min(delta, l_s)
  bitwise at f = 1 (LES regime) and l_v at f = 0 (degenerate
  resolved field, RANS regime) under either form.
* Momentum: the full dynamic stress tau keeps the v0 machinery
  unchanged, but only its HORIZONTAL flux divergences step explicitly
  (du_i = -(d/dx tau_ix + d/dy tau_iy)); the vertical SGS flux is
  remodeled anisotropically as -K_v*d(phi)/dz and advanced with
  backward-Euler Thomas columns (zero-flux ends,
  :func:`implicit_vertical_diffusion`), likewise the vertical part of
  e-transport (coefficient 2*K_v) and -- through the same solver --
  the scalars' vertical mixing (K_v/PR_T; driver wiring is S3-6c).
  The e-budget buoyancy term rides the vertical channel:
  K_h,v = K_v/PR_T.  Dropping the d/dz(tau_i3) fluxes in favor of
  -K_v*d(phi)/dz is the standard mesoscale anisotropic closure (WRF's
  horizontal-Smagorinsky + PBL-column split does the same); the u<->w
  exchange is then modeled by different closures in the two equations,
  which is accepted and documented, and the 2e/3 isotropic part no
  longer exerts a vertical e-pressure force on w.

S3-6d amendment (analytic dissipation substep): the split step's e
update no longer carries dissipation as an explicit forward-Euler
source.  The substep order is (1) explicit sources
e* = e^n + dt*(P_h + P_v + buoyancy + T_h,e); (2) ANALYTIC decay
e* -> e*/(1 + b*dt)^2 with b = C_E*sqrt(max(e*, E_MIN))/(2*l_d) --
the EXACT solution of de/dt = -C_E*e^{3/2}/l_d over one dt from
initial value e* (l_d frozen at its e^n evaluation; verify by
substitution: e(t) = e0/(1+bt)^2 gives de/dt = -2b*e0/(1+bt)^3 =
-C_E*e^{3/2}/l_d iff b = C_E*sqrt(e0)/(2*l_d)); (3) clip to E_MIN;
(4) implicit vertical e-transport.  Explicit Euler dissipation is
unstable once dt*C_E*sqrt(e)/l_d > O(1) (outer-nest surface layer: l_B ~
kappa*z ~ 10 m, dt = 60 s puts the number at ~3 for e ~ e_eq), which
pinned surface-cell e in an E_MIN limit cycle under the live u*
source; the analytic substep is unconditionally stable, positivity-
preserving (0 <= e*/(1+b*dt)^2 <= e* for e* >= 0), and exact.

SPLIT-STEP LEDGER THEOREM (S3-6b statement, S3-6d decay channel).  On
a horizontally periodic box with the clamped zero-flux vertical
channel and UNIFORM dz, define for one :func:`sase_split_step` step
(per velocity component i):

    u_i* = u_i^n + dt*T_h,i     with T_h,i = -(ddx tau_ix + ddy tau_iy)
    u_i^{n+1} = (I - dt*D_v)^{-1} u_i*      [backward Euler, D_v the
                flux-form zero-flux operator with face diffusivities
                K_f = avg(K_v)]
    P_h = -(tau_xx*ddx u + tau_yy*ddy v + tau_xy*(ddy u + ddx v)
            + tau_xz*ddx w + tau_yz*ddy w)        [tau and grads at n]
    P_v = sum_i K_f*(dz u_i^{n+1})^2 at faces, split half to each
          neighbor cell (:func:`_vertical_production`)
    e*    = e^n + dt*(P_h + P_v + buoyancy + T_h,e)
    D     = e* - e*/(1 + b*dt)^2,  b = C_E*sqrt(max(e*, E_MIN))/(2*l_d)
            [the exact decay decrement over dt]
    e_clip = max(e* - D, E_MIN),  clip_gain = e_clip - (e* - D)
    dKE   = sum u^n.(u* - u^n) + sum u^{n+1}.(u^{n+1} - u*)
    dE    = sum(e^{n+1} - e^n) - dt*sum(buoyancy) - dt*sum(T_h,e)
            - sum(implicit e-transport increment)
    dHeat = sum(D - clip_gain).

Then dKE + dE + dHeat = 0 exactly in exact arithmetic and to relative
roundoff (< 1e-11, pinned by test) in FP64, because
(i)  the explicit pairing sum u^n . T_h = -sum P_h holds by horizontal
     summation-by-parts: the centered roll operators are skew-adjoint
     on the periodic directions (sum a*Db = -sum b*Da), and P_h pairs
     ONLY horizontal derivatives of u^n against tau; and
(ii) the implicit pairing sum u^{n+1}.(u^{n+1} - u*) =
     dt*sum u^{n+1}.D_v u^{n+1} = -dt*sum P_v holds by flux-form
     telescoping with zero end fluxes (production is deposited into e
     from the IMPLICIT-solved gradients -- the brief's "implicit-solved
     fluxes" pairing -- which is exactly what makes the identity hold;
     backward Euler damps each D_v eigenmode by 1/(1 + dt*lambda_m) in
     (0, 1], so the summed P_v = sum_m lambda_m a_m^2/(1+dt*lambda_m)
     is non-negative and the pointwise P_v is non-negative by
     construction).
The e channel closes by construction, and the S3-6d decay channel
SIMPLIFIES the algebra: e_clip - e^n = dt*(P_h + P_v + buoyancy +
T_h,e) - D + clip_gain identically (D is defined as the difference e*
minus its decayed value -- no discretization residual exists to
absorb), so with the theorem's exclusions
dE = dt*sum(P_h + P_v) - sum(D) + sum(clip_gain)
   = -dKE - dHeat.
The decay deposit into heat is exact by construction: D equals the
integral of C_E*e^{3/2}/l_d along the true decay trajectory, is
sign-definite (0 <= D <= e* wherever e* >= 0), and the floor can now
engage only where the SOURCES drive e* below E_MIN (decay alone
cannot cross the floor), so heat = D - clip_gain is >= 0 except in
those rare source-driven cells (v0's forward-Euler overshoot, which
the clip routinely caught, is structurally gone).  Unlike the v0
theorem this statement needs NO periodic vertical: (i) uses only
horizontal rolls and (ii) telescopes on any zero-flux column, so it
holds verbatim for the uniform clamped column.  Variable-``dz_col``
columns remain diagnostic-only under the unweighted ledger (the
1/thick_k factors break unweighted telescoping; a thickness-weighted
ledger would close on shared columns -- characterized here,
deliberately not pinned).

S3-6e amendment (RANS-limit horizontal governor + damping-layer
production taper; smoke-gate G2 adjudication 2026-07-20).  Two changes
to :func:`sase_split_step`, both formulation-level:

* HORIZONTAL GOVERNOR (:func:`governed_stress`).  The horizontal
  channel's viscosity becomes the f-blend
      nu = f*c_nu*delta*sqrt(e) + (1-f)*K_smag,
      K_smag = min((C_S*delta)^2*|D_h|, SMAG_KM_CAP*delta),
  with |D_h| the audited WRF 2-D Smagorinsky deformation (constants
  block above).  Rationale: the retired (1-f) momentum background
  (C_K/PR_T)*delta*sqrt(e) scales with the FILTER width in the RANS
  limit, where the across-cell strain is mesoscale gradient rather
  than turbulence -- at the outer nest (delta = 12 km) it converted synoptic
  deformation into subgrid-e production (the smoke G2/G7 4-6.6x
  surface-e excess).  The deformation form is WRF's own mesoscale
  closure for exactly this regime.  The SAME nu field now serves the
  stress, the e-transport K_m, and the scalar K_h = nu/PR_T --
  superseding, on the split path only, the registered v0 coefficient
  asymmetry (bare C_K in K_m vs C_K/PR_T in the stress background);
  the bit-frozen v0 machinery (``model_stress``/``e_rhs``) keeps it.
  ENERGETICS (registered decision, WRF-fidelity option adopted): the
  smag component's drain BYPASSES e and deposits directly into heat,
  mirroring WRF km_opt=4 semantics where horizontal Smagorinsky
  diffusion feeds no prognostic e (WRF simply drops the KE; we keep
  it, exactly, in the heat channel).  With r = nu_smag/max(nu,
  NU_BLEND_EPS) in [0, 1], the horizontal pairing splits as
      P_h,heat = r*(P_h,tot + (2/3)*e*div_h),   [= 2*nu_smag*G, the
                 smag share of the viscous pairing G]
      P_h,e    = P_h,tot - P_h,heat,            [dynamic + isotropic]
  and only P_h,e feeds e.  The dynamic solve is UNTOUCHED: it remains
  the partition sensor (its Germano bases are the v0 pair), while the
  applied RANS-limit closure is the audited deformation form --
  sensed-vs-applied stress mismatch at f < 1 is documented and
  accepted (the identical acceptance WRF makes by running Smagorinsky
  under any km_opt=4 flow).
* DAMPING-LAYER TAPER.  With ``zdamp`` given (the driver passes
  ``cfg.zdamp`` when damp_opt == 3), the e-equation production
  channels taper across the model-top damping layer with the SAME
  weight law as the audited damp_opt=3 KDH damper (acoustic.cu
  advance_w_phi: sin^2(pi/2*(z - (ztop - zdamp))/zdamp) above
  ztop - zdamp, per-column heights):
      g(z) = 1 - sin^2(pi/2*clip((z - (htop - zdamp))/zdamp, 0, 1)),
  evaluated at layer CENTERS with htop the per-column top interface
  (g = 1 below the layer, -> 0 at the top).  The tapered production is
  NOT discarded -- the withheld share redirects to heat so the ledger
  stays exact:
      x    = P_h,e + P_v,   src = g*x,   gb = g*buoyancy
      e*   = e + dt*((src + gb) + T_h,e)
      heat = D - clip_gain + dt*(P_h,heat + (x - src)).
  Buoyancy is tapered WITHOUT redirect (it is the PE-exchange channel,
  excluded from the closed triangle by the dE definition; the measured
  buoyancy channel becomes g*buoyancy).  e in the taper region then
  relaxes toward E_MIN on the dissipation timescale through the
  untouched S3-6d analytic decay substep -- no hard clamp exists.

RESTATED LEDGER THEOREM (S3-6e).  On the uniform-dz horizontally
periodic clamped box, with the definitions above and
    dE    = sum(e_clip - e^n) - dt*sum(gb) - dt*sum(T_h,e)
    dHeat = sum(D - clip_gain) + dt*sum(P_h,heat) + dt*sum(x - src)
    dKE   = dKE_expl + dKE_impl
the identity dKE + dE + dHeat = 0 holds exactly in exact arithmetic:
identity (i) pairs dKE_expl against the TOTAL P_h,tot = P_h,e +
P_h,heat (the momentum tendency rides the full blended tau, and the
split P_h,e + P_h,heat recombines to P_h,tot identically), identity
(ii) pairs dKE_impl against P_v as before, and the taper moves
production between the e and heat channels without creating or
destroying it (src + (x - src) = x identically).  At f = 1 with no
taper the step reduces BITWISE to the S3-6d formulation (0*K_smag,
r = 0, g = 1 are FP-exact no-ops), which the reduction test pins.
Heat is no longer pointwise sign-definite: P_h,heat inherits the
horizontal pairing's local sign (backscatter regions), exactly as
bookkeeping requires -- WRF drops this energy silently, the ledger
tracks it.

S3-6f amendment (partition cap + w-based resolved-fraction bound;
mesoscale-sensing concession, controller adjudication 2026-07-20).
The S3-6e review's root cause for the outer-nest surface-e excess: the
Germano solve returned f ~ 1 on ALL real domains, because HORIZONTAL-
velocity structure functions at mesoscale Delta sample balanced
(synoptic) motion -- they carry ZERO information about subgrid BL
turbulence there -- and the (then-linear, pre-S3-9)
l_d = f*delta + (1-f)*l_B blend then set the dissipation length to
the FILTER scale (12 km vs l_B ~ 9.4 m at the outer-nest surface:
dissipation throttled ~1280x, surface fixed point ~295 m^2/s^2).
This is a formulation-level concession, registered in
the spec (sections 3, 4.1, 10): flow-sensing from horizontal velocity
is provably uninformative in the mesoscale limit, so the sensed
partition must be BOUNDED there by prescribed scale information.  Two
bounds now cap the solved f INSIDE :func:`sase_split_step`, so the
capped value flows through every consumer (the l_d blend, the
governed-stress f-blend, and the (1-f) momentum-background weight):

* PARTITION CAP (primary; the Honnert 2011 / Shin-Hong 2015 class of
  prescribed Delta/z_i partitions, credited -- prior-art doc):
      f_used <= f_cap(rho),   rho = delta / z_i,
      f_cap = 1                          for rho <= F_CAP_KNEE (= 1)
      f_cap = exp(-((rho - F_CAP_KNEE)/F_CAP_WIDTH)^2)   above,
  a C^1 monotone ramp that is FP-exact 1 through the LES regime and
  Gaussian beyond the knee (:func:`partition_cap`).  FORM RATIONALE
  (documented decision; STATED FOR THE THEN-LINEAR BLEND -- S3-9's
  geometric l_d no longer needs the cap to reach 1e-3, and the
  registered Gaussian form deliberately stands unchanged): the
  (pre-S3-9) l_d blend is LINEAR in f, so l_d ~ l_B
  at the surface requires f_cap <~ l_B/delta ~ 1e-3 by rho ~ 10 --
  algebraic ramps of the 1/(1+x^2) class decay too slowly to get
  there; the Gaussian ramp reaches 1.6e-9 at rho = 10 with
  F_CAP_WIDTH = 2 while staying loose in the gray zone (0.78 at
  rho = 2, 0.37 at rho = 3 -- an UPPER bound there, deliberately
  above the Honnert subgrid-fraction data, because in the gray zone
  the W-SENSOR below supplies the estimate and the cap only guards
  the tail).  z_i is the bulk-Richardson boundary-layer height
  (:func:`bulk_richardson_zi`), the YSU-convention crossing
  (``npref.np_ysu_column`` ``diagnose``) collapsed to one registered
  critical value: Rib(k) = (theta_k - theta_1)*(g*z_k/theta_1)
  / max(|u_k|^2 + |v_k|^2, RIB_WSPD2_FLOOR), first crossing of
  RIB_CRIT = 0.25 (the classic Vogelezang-Holtslag-class radiosonde
  method; YSU's two-regime brcr with thermal excess is deliberately
  simplified -- the cap needs a SCALE, not a flux boundary, and the
  fixture bands tolerate factor-2 z_i shifts), linear interpolation
  in Rib between the bracketing layer centers.  Dry theta stands in
  for theta_v (L1 dry core).  FLOORS/FALLBACKS (documented): z_i
  floors at the FIRST INTERIOR layer center z[1] (a very stable BL
  whose Rib crosses immediately gets z_i = z[1] -- the strongest cap
  the geometry admits, which is the stable-BL fallback); a column
  with NO crossing (neutral through the top, e.g. weak winds over
  deep neutral stratification) returns the TOP layer center (the
  weakest cap -- deliberately permissive, a real profile crosses well
  below); nz = 1 returns z[0].  The step uses the domain-MEAN z_i
  (interior mean on the device path, matching the solve's
  specified-boundary exclusion).
* W-BASED RESOLVED-FRACTION BOUND (the gray-zone lever;
  :func:`w_resolved_bound`): resolved VERTICAL-velocity structure
  functions are the discriminating signal where horizontal ones
  saturate -- balanced mesoscale motion is quasi-horizontal, BL
  turbulence is not.  D2 of w rides the SAME r in {1, 2, 4}
  horizontal-increment machinery, N^2-SCREENED: cells with dry
  N^2 > N2_SCREEN (= 1e-4 s^-2, the free-troposphere Brunt-Vaisala
  benchmark N ~ 0.01 s^-1) are EXCLUDED from the accumulation --
  stratification at or above the tropospheric norm supports buoyancy
  oscillations at the sampled scales, so its w variance is prima
  facie gravity-wave motion, not turbulence (the screen is what
  keeps mountain/inertia-gravity waves from inflating the sensed
  resolved fraction).  Increments are anchored at screened cells
  (the anchor cell decides, mirroring the solve's boundary-mask
  convention); ``n2 is None`` (test boxes) treats every cell as
  neutral = passing, consistent with the module-wide n2-absent
  convention.  With E_r_w = 0.5*D2_w(2) (the w-component mirror of
  the sensor's e_res -- a one-component proxy that UNDERSTATES
  resolved energy ~3x under isotropy, i.e. biases the bound toward
  RANS, the conservative side):
      alpha_w = clip(e_mean/(e_mean + E_r_w), 0, 1),  f_w = 1 - alpha_w
  and f_used <= f_w wherever the screen passes ANY cell.  A SILENT
  screen (zero passing cells -- e.g. a fully stable domain at night)
  makes the w-sensor abstain: f_w = 1.0 (no constraint; alpha_w is
  reported at its degenerate all-subgrid value 1.0 and must not be
  read as a measurement) -- THE CAP GOVERNS REGARDLESS.

Combination (:func:`sase_split_step`):
    f_used = min(f_solved, f_cap, f_w),
where f_solved is the untouched Germano 2x2 solution -- the solve
retains full authority to LOWER f (it detects under-resolution
correctly); the caps only bound the claimed resolvedness from above
with scale/vertical-velocity information the horizontal identity
cannot supply.  c_nu is NOT rescaled: the dynamic eddy weight is
f_used*c_nu, so capping f attenuates the eddy channel and hands the
balance to the audited (1-f_used) RANS closures -- exactly the
concession's intent (at f_used -> 0 the step is WRF km_opt=4
horizontal Smagorinsky + Blackadar-length RANS dissipation, and the
gate-2a cap becomes the EXACT surface fixed point).  At
delta/z_i <= 1 with w-rich fields (f_cap = 1 FP-exact, f_w >=
f_solved) the min leaves f_solved bitwise and the S3-6d/6e behavior
is recovered (pinned).  The ledger gains the diagnostics f_solved,
f_cap, f_w, zi, w_coverage; ``f`` remains the value the step USED.
The LEDGER THEOREM IS UNAFFECTED: the cap changes coefficients
(f, hence nu and l_d), never channels -- every identity above is
f-pointwise, so closure holds verbatim (asserted with the cap
engaged).

S3-6g amendment (regime-consistent Prandtl number; smoke-c sealed-FAIL
diagnosis, controller ledger 2026-07-20 ~23:0x, registered before
data).  Smoke-c exonerated wave feedback (f_w flat) and TKE runaway
(bounded, decelerating) and converged on the scalar channel: the FIXED
PR_T = 1/3 is the LES-limit (Deardorff inertial-range) value, but the
S3-6f cap drives the real domains into the RANS/transition regime
(f_used ~ 0 at the outer nest), where the observed
neutral-surface-layer Prandtl number is ~0.7-1 (K_h ~ 1.2*kappa*u*z
against K_m ~ kappa*u*z -- registered approximation #1, now promoted
LAUNCH-BLOCKING).  Dividing
the RANS-regime K_v by the LES 1/3 tripled every scalar diffusivity:
the model mixed its own morning stratification down (inv_h rising,
theta gradient decaying) and the released stability showed up as the
field-wide 10 m wind amplification (inner-nest mean 4.3 -> 14.2 m/s over
90 min) with "healthy" TKE.  The fix is the registered regime blend

    Pr_t(f) = PR_RANS + f*(PR_LES - PR_RANS),
    PR_RANS = 0.85, PR_LES = 1/3 (the former PR_T),

implemented in the FP-exact two-product form f*PR_LES + (1-f)*PR_RANS
(:func:`prandtl_blend`; both endpoints bitwise, the module's blend
idiom) and evaluated at the step's USED f -- the SAME f_used that
blends l_d and the governed stress, so the Prandtl number rides the
identical regime judgment as every other S3-6b/6e/6f blend.  The
ledger theorem is unaffected (Pr enters coefficients only: the
buoyancy K_h, which the dE definition excludes from the closed
triangle).

C_MOM_BG RATIONALE (registered decision): the 0.30 momentum-background

but is the neutral-K_m momentum-channel calibration -- not a
scalar-channel Prandtl usage -- so the regime blend must NOT drag it.
It is renamed to the standalone registered constant C_MOM_BG (defined
as C_K/PR_LES so its FP64 value 0.30000000000000004 stays bit-identical
to every frozen v0 fixture and golden) and stays FIXED for all f.

The blend flows through every scalar-side consumer: the split step's
buoyancy term, the driver's implicit vertical scalar solves, and the
governed horizontal scalar channel (kh_fac).  The step exports
``pr_t`` in its ledger (diagnostic; the driver recomputes the same
value from the retained ``f`` so the CPU-shim seam needs no new key).
At f = 1 the whole amendment is FP-exact inert (Pr_t = PR_LES = the
old PR_T bitwise); at f < 1 the buoyancy channel shifts and the
SPLIT_* trajectory goldens re-pin deliberately (tests/sase_goldens.py
records the measured shift).  RED evidence obligation: the
inversion-persistence fixture (test_sase.py) demonstrates the failure
this amendment fixes -- with Pr forced to the old fixed 1/3 (PR_RANS
monkeypatched to PR_LES, which reproduces the pre-S3-6g formulation
bitwise at f = 0) the prescribed morning inversion erodes 1.7x faster
(0.529 vs 0.304 K of the 2.075 K jump in 1800 s) and its height rises
3.5x faster (29.8 vs 8.6 m) than with the blend -- the height signal
carries the mixdown feedback (eroded jump -> lower N^2 -> longer l_v
-> larger K_v) most cleanly.  (S3-6h note: the RED leg now also pins
the pre-S3-6h lengths -- see that section -- so the historical
measurements stay bitwise.)

S3-6h amendment (Bougeault-Lacarrere displacement lengths in the RANS
limb; jet-coupling diagnosis, ratified option 2, controller
ledger 2026-07-21 ~01:0x, registered before implementation).  The
smoke-c/d obs arbitration (the surface-observation arbitration record
filed with the campaign evidence; an 8-station surface-observation
table) plus an independent spun-up CPU WRF frame
established that the SASE inner-nest 10 m wind amplification (13:30Z
mean 14.03 m/s vs observed ~5.7, ramping while obs held) is SPURIOUS,
and
the surviving diagnosis is missing stability-aware suppression of
RANS-limb vertical momentum mixing: l_v = min(l_B, l_s) carries only
LOCAL stability information (l_s = 0.76*sqrt(e)/N), so a morning
column whose mixed layer erodes toward neutral under a capping
inversion sees l_s -> infinity locally, l_v -> l_B (the NEUTRAL
length, up to 150 m), K_v = O(10-100) m^2/s in the sheared stable
transition -- and the low-level jet couples to the ground.  The fix
is the Bougeault-Lacarrere (1989, MWR 117, 1872-1890) parcel-
energetics length pair, computed per column against the LIVE theta
profile:

    l_up(k):  first l with  int_{z_k}^{z_k+l} beta*(theta_v(z') -
              theta_v(z_k)) dz' = e(k),   beta = G_ACCEL/theta_v(z_k)
    l_down(k): the downward mirror, integrand beta*(theta_v(z_k) -
              theta_v(z')), bounded by the surface,

(:func:`bl89_displacement_lengths`; dry theta_v = theta, the L1 core's
registered simplification; the discrete integral is EXACT for
piecewise-linear theta_v -- layer-wise quadrature plus the quadratic
fractional-segment solve, derivations at the functions).  The lengths
are inversion-aware BY CONSTRUCTION: a parcel rising toward an
inversion is stopped by the inversion's integrated buoyancy however
weak the local N^2 below it -- exactly the information the coupling
failure lacked -- and they are flow-derived, not prescribed (the SASE
DNA; credited synthesis, AROME/Meso-NH lineage).  Combination forms
(:func:`bl89_combine`; constants block at BL89_MIX_EXP):
l_mix = the -2/3-power mean (Cuxart-Bougeault-Redelsperger 2000,
QJRMS 126, 1-30 -- the Meso-NH/AROME operational form, dominated by
the smaller displacement), l_eps = min(l_up, l_down) (BL89's
dissipation length; l_eps <= l_mix always).  Wiring
(:func:`bl89_rans_lengths` -> :func:`sase_split_step` step 2):

    l_mix_rans = min(l_B, l_s, l_mix_BL89)
    l_eps_rans = min(l_B,      l_eps_BL89)
    l_v  = f*min(l_B, l_s) + (1-f)*l_mix_rans     [K_v = C_KV*l_v*rt e]
    l_d  = min(delta**f * l_eps_rans**(1-f), l_s) [dissipation blend;
                                                   geometric since S3-9
                                                   -- was linear here]

* the l_B min is the kappa-z-class floor/match (BL89_KZ_MATCH): the
  NEUTRAL LOG-LAYER FIXTURE REMAINS A HARD CONSTRAINT, and in a
  neutral column the BL89 lengths are pure geometry (l_down = z,
  l_up = htop - z) >= l_B everywhere except within ~l_B of the model
  top, so the log-layer window is bitwise untouched (the fixture
  engine now runs the composed length to prove it);
* l_s is RETAINED as the outer stability min (BL89_LS_DECISION):
  the analytic uniform-stratification fixture pins BL89's stable
  limit at l_up = l_down = sqrt(2e)/N (Rodier et al. 2017, JAS 74)
  = 1.86x the audited Deardorff 0.76*sqrt(e)/N, so retirement would
  LENGTHEN the stable-limit RANS mixing length in exactly the regime
  under suppression; retention makes the amendment MONOTONE (no
  RANS-limb length ever exceeds its pre-S3-6h value);
* the LES limb is untouched BITWISE: at f = 1 the two-product blend
  gives 1.0*min(l_B, l_s) + 0.0*l_mix_rans and l_d = 1.0*delta +
  0.0*l_eps_rans, both FP-exact (pinned);
* the ledger theorem is UNAFFECTED: the lengths are coefficients
  (K_v faces, l_d), never channels -- every identity is pointwise in
  the coefficients, so closure holds verbatim (asserted with BL89
  binding).

RED evidence obligation (jet-decoupling fixture, test_sase.py): the
single-column scoring-box mean profile from the reference CPU WRF frame
(the trusted reference forecast frame at 13:08Z; the jet-profile
fixture module carries the code-generated constant table with
provenance) -- a
strongly stable surface-based morning layer (theta 286.9 -> 295.8 K
across the lowest 470 m) under a 17.6 m/s low-level jet at 472 m with
4.3 m/s at 8.8 m -- integrated 3600 s at dt = 60 with the driver's
exact per-step sequence.  RED = the pre-S3-6h formulation, reproduced
bitwise by monkeypatching :func:`bl89_rans_lengths` to return the v0
pair (the S3-6g pinning idiom): the jet couples and the 10 m
diagnostic exits the observed band (> 7.0 m/s; measured numbers at
the fixture).  GREEN = this amendment holds the 10 m wind inside the
obs-derived [4.5, 7.0] m/s band AND the jet-core wind within 15% of
its initial value (no erosion of the jet from below).  Obs anchor:
an 8-station surface-observation 13Z mean of 5.61 m/s (the
arbitration record filed with the campaign evidence).

S3-6i amendment (decoupled stable-limit diffusivity coefficient C_KS;
controller ledger 2026-07-21 ~01:5x, registered before
implementation).  The S3-6h jet fixture falsified the ratified
length-locality premise on its own trajectory (BL89 bitwise-inert on
the smooth strongly-stable frame profile) and isolated the true driver
of the spurious inner-nest morning-wind amplification: the STABLE-LIMIT
COEFFICIENT COMPOSITION.  Wherever l_s bound the RANS mixing length,
the S3-6b wiring gave

    K_v = C_KV*l_s*sqrt(e) = C_KV*LS_COEF*e/N = 0.742*e/N,

i.e. the neutral-wall log-layer constant C_KV = C_E^{1/3} (a
calibration valid ONLY in the l_B -> kappa*z wall regime -- its own
derivation block says so) riding the shared composition into the
stably-stratified regime: ~10x the Deardorff-consistent stable
composite 0.076*e/N (Deardorff 1980 pairs the 0.76*sqrt(e)/N length
with C_K = 0.1) and 3-5x the ~0.15-0.25*e/N operational band (S3-6h
report section 4, the registered finding).  The fix decouples the
COEFFICIENT and leaves the length composition untouched: the RANS
limb rides the min-aware blend

    rho = min(l_mix_rans/l_s, 1)               [0 where N^2 <= 0]
    C_r = C_KV + (C_KS/LS_COEF - C_KV)*rho**CKS_BLEND_EXP
    K_v = f*C_KV*l_les*sqrt(e) + (1-f)*C_r*l_mix_rans*sqrt(e)

(:func:`stable_limit_coefficient`; constants block at C_KS; the l_v
length blend becomes the equivalent two-product K_v blend so the
coefficient change is RANS-limb-only).  Properties, each pinned:

* STABLE LIMIT: where l_s binds, rho = 1 BITWISE (l_s is a term of
  the l_mix_rans min), so K_v = (C_KS/LS_COEF)*l_s*sqrt(e) =
  C_KS*e/N -- the registered decoupled asymptote.
* NEUTRAL WALL: unstable/neutral cells (n2 <= 0 or absent) keep
  C_r = C_KV FP-EXACT (x + dC*0.0 == x), so the neutral log-layer
  engine is bitwise untouched -- l_s never binds in a neutral column
  (asserted in the fixture).
* CONTINUITY ACROSS THE NEUTRAL<->STABLE TRANSITION (claim narrowed
  in S3-9c per the adversarial review, Minor 3): approaching N = 0 with
  l_B binding, rho = l_B*N/(LS_COEF*sqrt(e)) is linear in N, so with
  CKS_BLEND_EXP = 2 the coefficient deficit C_KV - C_r ~ N^2 = n2.
  Parameterized by the signed frequency N = sqrt(n2) the blend is
  C^1 (dK_v/dN -> 0 from the stable side, matching the
  N-independent neutral side); as a function of the MODEL INPUT n2
  it is C^0 ONLY -- the deficit onset is LINEAR in n2, so
  dK_v/d(n2) jumps from 0 to a finite slope at neutral.  The blend
  is continuous with no jump in K at n2 = 0; the linear-in-n2 onset
  is the registered behavior (pinned by the linear-onset witness in
  the closed-forms test).  The other slope breaks in K are the
  PRE-EXISTING min-switch kinks (l_B <-> l_s <-> l_BL89), which the
  blend co-locates with (rho reaches 1 exactly where the l_s min
  engages); kinks live in coefficients only and the ledger theorem
  is pointwise in the coefficients, so closure holds verbatim
  (asserted under stable binding).
* LES LIMB BITWISE: f = 1 gives 1.0*C_KV*l_les*sqrt(e) + 0.0*(...)
  FP-exact -- the stable decoupling is RANS-only (pinned).
* DISSIPATION UNTOUCHED: l_d keeps its S3-6b/S3-6h composition and
  C_E (one-stability-limit rule) -- C_KS is a DIFFUSIVITY
  coefficient, exactly as registered.

CALIBRATION (the jet-decoupling fixture, promoted to its registered
GREEN criteria): C_KS swept over {0.076, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25} on
the frame-true column; the registered choice is the LARGEST value
that holds the 10 m wind inside [4.5, 7.0] m/s through 3600 s AND
the jet-core wind within 15% of initial, with margin (measured sweep
table at the fixture and the C_KS constant).

S3-6k amendment (decoupled stable-limb DISSIPATION coefficient C_ES;
gated by ``RunConfig.sase_stable_dissipation``, DEFAULT False, so HEAD
is bitwise unchanged until a run asks for it).  S3-6i decoupled the
stable-limit DIFFUSIVITY and recorded the omission in its own words --
"DISSIPATION UNTOUCHED: l_d keeps its S3-6b/S3-6h composition and C_E
(one-stability-limit rule) -- C_KS is a DIFFUSIVITY coefficient" (the
bullet above).  This amendment closes that omission on the identical
machinery.  THE DEFECT: where l_s binds l_d, the limb dissipates at

    eps = (C_E/LS_COEF)*e*N = 1.2237*e*N,

i.e. the neutral-wall constant C_E riding the Deardorff stability
length into the stably-stratified regime -- the same category of error
S3-6i fixed one slot over.  Deardorff's own pairing for that length is
c_eps -> 0.19 as lambda/Delta -> 0 (C_ES; provenance and the published
transcription at the constant).  MEASURED on the trusted MYNN reference
this session (reflen.py, box-B land, the frame the envelope doc names):
the reference dissipates at 0.2404*e*N (deck band) to 0.2765*e*N
(subcloud) on its own length -- 4.4-5.1x below HEAD -- while its
diffusivity ratio K_h/(e/N) = 0.3111-0.3578 sits within 6-18% of this
module's C_KS/PR_RANS = 0.29412.  One half of the pair is calibrated,
the other is not.

THE FORM, mirroring S3-6i's two-product K_v blend term for term:

    l_s    = LS_COEF*sqrt(max(e, E_MIN))/N            [N^2 > 0]
    rho    = min(l_d/l_s, 1)
    w      = rho**CKS_BLEND_EXP
    C_rans = (1 - w)*C_E + w*C_ES                     [two-product]
    C_eps  = f*C_E + (1 - f)*C_rans   where N^2 > 0    [two-product]
    C_eps  = C_E                      otherwise        [SELECTED]
    eps    = C_eps*e^{3/2}/l_d

(:func:`stable_dissipation_coefficient`).  Three properties, each
pinned, each essential:

* STABLE LIMIT BITWISE: :func:`dissipation_length` ends
  ``l = np.where(stable, np.minimum(l, ls), l)``, so l_d == l_s BITWISE
  wherever the stability limit binds and rho == 1.0 exactly there.  The
  TWO-PRODUCT form then returns C_ES bitwise (0.19,
  ``52b81e85eb51c83f``); the affine C_E + (C_ES - C_E)*w returns
  0.19000000000000006 (``54b81e85eb51c83f``) -- measured this session,
  which is why the form is two-product and not affine.  rho is built on
  l_d, the length the coefficient MULTIPLIES, not on l_mix_rans.
* NEUTRAL/UNSTABLE BITWISE, BY SELECTION AND NOT BY CANCELLATION: at
  n2 <= 0 (or ``n2 is None``) the coefficient is the SELECTED literal
  C_E -- the authority branches on the same predicate the device gate
  ``if (has_ces && ls_v > 0.0f)`` uses, because the arithmetic does NOT
  cancel.  The first S3-6k commit (fb67b9d) returned the unconditional
  blend f*C_E + (1-f)*C_rans and relied on C_rans == C_E there; measured
  this session over a uniform 10001-point f grid, 3661 of those f values
  make f*C_E + (1-f)*C_E return 0.9299999999999999 or
  0.9300000000000002 instead of 0.93 (``c3f5285c8fc2ed3f``), and the
  recorded production f = 4.1188928660938e-05 is one of them -- so the
  FP64 authority disagreed with its own FP32 mirror by 1 ulp on
  precisely the cells the amendment claims not to touch.  Measured at
  step level on a fully unstable column (n2 < 0 in every cell, live
  solved f = 0.6248773184883271): e and heat moved by 4.16e-17 with the
  switch ON.  With the gate transcribed the neutral log layer, the
  C_KV = C_E**(1/3) identity and every moist-unstable cell -- including
  the M1-substituted cells where N^2 goes negative, which is where the
  cloud-top over-entrainment defect lives -- are untouched, and this
  amendment is bitwise ABSENT from that defect and cannot deepen it.
  Pinned by ``test_stable_dissipation_coefficient_closed_forms`` over a
  DENSE f sweep (the old {0, 0.5, 1} sample is all-safe and could not
  see this) and at step level by
  ``test_sase_split_step_stable_dissipation_is_inert_where_unstratified``
  on a fixture whose solved f is asserted unsafe.
* LES LIMB BITWISE: the outer f-weighting makes the change RANS-only,
  restoring S3-6i's own pinned LES-limb property for the dissipation
  half: at f = 1 the expression is C_E bitwise for ANY stratification
  and any C_rans, so every LES fixture is inert with the switch ON as
  well as OFF.

DERIVED, registered so no later coefficient move shifts it silently:
the stable-limb critical Richardson number

    Ri* = C_KS/(C_eps/LS_COEF + C_KS/PR_RANS)

is 0.35385638343882664 pre-S3-6i (C_KV*LS_COEF limb), 0.16471188169301373
at HEAD, and 0.45945945945945943 under this switch.  Equivalently the
steady-state mixing efficiency Gamma_m = K_v*N^2/eps = C_KS*LS_COEF/C_eps
moves from 0.2043 -- Osborn's (1980, J. Phys. Oceanogr. 10:83) bound,
hard-coded into a PROGNOSTIC equation -- to 1.0.

WHAT Ri* ACTUALLY IS, and the LANE IT CLOSES (S3-6k landing amendment;
measured this session, ``ident.py``, and registered because it is a
NEGATIVE result that saves a future lane the trip).  Divide numerator
and denominator by C_KS/LS_COEF and the registered expression is the
HARMONIC MEAN of the mixing efficiency and the Prandtl number:

    Ri* = Gamma_m*PR_RANS/(Gamma_m + PR_RANS),   Gamma_m = C_KS*LS_COEF/C_eps

reproducing the three registered values to <= 1 ulp (0.16471188169301376
vs ...373 at HEAD and 0.3538563834388267 vs ...664 pre-S3-6i, both 1 ulp
from the associativity of the rewrite; 0.45945945945945943 BITWISE under
this switch).  A harmonic mean is strictly below both its arguments, so

    Ri* < min(Gamma_m, PR_RANS)     STRICTLY, at every admissible pair
                                    (0 violations in 200000 random pairs
                                    over [1e-2, 1e1]^2, measured)

and therefore PR_RANS CANNOT lift Ri* above Gamma_m: at HEAD's
Gamma_m = 0.2043 the supremum of Ri* over ALL PR_RANS is 0.2043
(PR_RANS = 0.4/0.85/2/10/1e6 give Ri* = 0.1352/0.1647/0.1854/0.2002/
0.2043).  A STABILITY-DEPENDENT PRANDTL NUMBER IS THEREFORE NOT A CURE
for the stable-limb collapse, and no length composition is either --
Ri* contains no length at all.

AND THE REFERENCE SUSTAINS ITS DECK ABOVE BOTH VALUES.  Measured this
session on the trusted MYNN 13:08Z frame (``ref.py``; dry gradient
Ri = N^2/S^2 on interior faces, land, 0.4-1.4 km AGL, BOTH bracketing
cells saturated on the model's own Tetens switch; the three scoring
regions are carried here as box A / box B / sector, smallest first --
their case identity lives with the campaign evidence, not here):

    box    n       Ri p50   p90     frac < 0.16471   frac < 0.45946
    box A   2,212  0.5968   1.7049      0.0118           0.3070
    box B  17,850  0.5450   1.2213      0.0202           0.3657
    sector 42,492  0.6037   1.4951      0.0305           0.3053

So 96.9-98.8% of the reference's own deck faces are SUPERCRITICAL under
HEAD's Ri* = 0.16471 -- the closure must set them to the E_MIN floor --
and 63.4-69.5% still are under C_ES's 0.45946.  Sustaining that deck
needs Gamma_m > 0.55, i.e. 2.7x Osborn's bound, and holding its top
decile needs Gamma_m > 1.2 AND PR_RANS > 1.2.  No admissible pair does
that.  The remaining move inside this closure is not a coefficient; it
is the EFB structure named below.

WHAT THIS IS NOT.  It does not remove the absorbing state.  Where l_s
binds, K, B and eps all stay exactly LINEAR in e, so the limb remains a
bang-bang switch with a hard critical Richardson number; only its value
moves.  Turbulence in the saturated layer will stay intermittent rather
than sustained.  The structural cure is a total-turbulent-energy/EFB
formulation in which buoyancy is a TKE<->TPE conversion and no critical
Ri exists (Mauritsen et al. 2007 JAS 64:4113; Zilitinkevich et al. 2007
BLM 125:167, 2013 QJRMS 139:1741) -- its own lane, not this one.
Reading this amendment as a well-posedness fix is a misreading.

CALIBRATION STATUS: **RED, AND THE SWITCH STAYS OFF.**  Measured this
session on the registered S3-6i calibration gate -- the frame-true
drag-free jet column, ``test_jet_decoupling_stable_coefficient_holds_
obs_band``, whose GREEN criteria are the obs-derived 10 m band
[4.5, 7.0] m/s at every step and jet-core hold within 15%:

    stable_dissipation   u10 min  u10 max  @900   @1800  @3600  jet dev
    False (registered)    5.701    6.580   6.423  6.479  6.580   0.063%
    True  (C_ES = 0.19)   5.701    8.394   7.917  8.263  8.394   0.218%
    [pre-S3-6i RED ref    5.857    7.356   7.103  7.220  7.356   0.19% ]

The switched-on leg exits the observation band, and by MORE than the
pre-S3-6i coupled formulation this whole line of work exists to fix.
Criterion 2 (jet-core hold) still passes; criterion 1 fails.

THE MECHANISM, measured, and it is NOT a 4.89x rescaling.  Below 500 m
in that column, l_s binds in 176 of 176 cells, and e rises from the
E_MIN floor (p50 1.000e-06 -- the absorbing state, i.e. the limb
produces no turbulence at all) to p50 9.670e-04, a factor of 216 at the
median and 1054 at the maximum, with K_v p50 going 0.000 -> 0.008
m^2/s.  That is the Ri* shift doing exactly what it says: the cell
population with 0.16471 < Ri < 0.45946 flips from "collapses to the
floor" to "sustains", and the extra mixing pulls the nocturnal jet
down.  The amendment therefore DOES remove the zero-TKE stable limb it
was designed to remove -- and the same act over-mixes the observed
morning stable boundary layer.

AT RUN SCALE THE SAME TWO-SIDEDNESS, MEASURED (S3-6k landing amendment;
``deck.py``/``ref.py`` on frames already on disk, intermediate nest,
land, saturated cells 0.4-1.4 km AGL on the model's own Tetens
switch).  The switch-on leg was run only with the M1 moist-N^2
substitution DISABLED
(the s36k M1-off run leg), so it is not a default-path result; but on
the discriminator that cannot be gamed by a scale factor -- the SHAPE
of the implied diffusivity profile -- it is the only configuration this
project has produced that matches.  Median implied

Within a factor of 1.4 of the reference in EVERY bin, monotone falling,
against a default path that is two orders high and has the wrong
gradient SIGN.  It still does not ship: the same leg is RED on the
registered jet gate above (u10 8.394 against [4.5, 7.0]) and its 13Z
resolved w_colmax reaches 19.32 m/s over box B / the sector against an
acceptance criterion of ~1.4 m/s.  The record is therefore NOT "the
amendment produces nothing"; it is "the amendment's diffusivity profile
is right and its momentum behaviour is wrong, and no single coefficient
reconciles them" -- which is the same conclusion the Ri* bound reaches
analytically.

WHAT THIS FALSIFIES.  Not C_ES on its own, and NOT by an amount anyone
may tune away: it falsifies the PAIR.  C_KS = 0.25 was selected on this
fixture with C_E in the dissipation slot; C_ES = 0.19 is published for
Deardorff's length with Deardorff's own diffusivity.  Each is defensible
alone and together they over-mix.  Ri* is the joint quantity -- the pair
enters it as C_KS/(C_eps/LS_COEF + C_KS/PR_RANS) -- so re-registering
either member alone is not available.  Moving C_KS is outside this
amendment's authority and moving C_ES to make a gate pass would be
fitting a registered constant to a target, which this module does not
do.  The switch is therefore committed DEFAULT FALSE and INERT, with
the measurement above as the reason.

CORRECTION (S3-6k landing amendment).  The sentence above closed by
handing back "the joint (C_KS, C_ES) re-registration" as though it were
an open door.  It is a CLOSED one, and it is recorded closed here so no
later lane re-opens it by hope.  Measured this session (``ident.py``):

  * holding C_ES at the published 0.19 and sweeping C_KS across its own
    registered sweep, Ri* moves 0.2239 / 0.2720 / 0.3517 / 0.4121 /
    0.4595 at C_KS = 0.076 / 0.10 / 0.15 / 0.20 / 0.25 -- so C_KS alone
    cannot be re-registered without moving Ri*, which is the first
    reading of the sentence and it holds;
  * moving the PAIR TOGETHER along Gamma_m = 1 (i.e. C_eps = C_KS*
    LS_COEF) leaves Ri* at 0.45945945945945943 BITWISE at every one of
    those five C_KS values, because on that line Ri* collapses to
    PR_RANS/(1 + PR_RANS) and the diffusivity coefficient drops out
    entirely.  The whole Gamma_m = 1 line has ONE Ri*, and it is
    0.45946 -- which the jet gate above measures RED.

Neither reading unblocks the RED.  The joint re-registration does not
have a free parameter to spend on it.

A NOTE ON THE SPELLING, so a later reader does not mistake a
coincidence for a derivation: C_ES = 0.19 and C_KS*LS_COEF = 0.25*0.76
are BITWISE EQUAL (both ``52b81e85eb51c83f``, measured), because
C_KS = 2^-2 exactly makes the product a pure exponent shift of
LS_COEF's mantissa (``52b81e85eb51e83f`` -- identical mantissa, exponent
lower by 2).  That is a coincidence of two independently published
two-digit constants, NOT a derivation of Deardorff's asymptote, and the
literal 0.19 therefore STAYS the registered spelling.  Spelling C_ES as
C_KS*LS_COEF would make a published constant a silent dependent of this
module's own diffusivity calibration -- the same false coupling
``C_MOM_BG``'s comment already warns about one screen down -- and it
would hollow out the anti-tuning tripwire, whose
``C_ES/LS_COEF == 0.25`` assertion would degrade into a restatement of
C_KS.  The identity is registered as ALGEBRA (the Gamma_m = 1 line
above), never as source.

S3-6j amendment (surface momentum stress in the vertical solve;
missing-friction diagnosis, Probe-4 falsification, controller ledger
2026-07-21, registered before implementation).  THE HOLE: ``ust`` fed
ONLY the surface e source (``physics.sase_surface_e_source``); the
momentum Thomas columns ran zero-flux at BOTH ends, so the resolved
wind felt NO surface drag anywhere in the SASE path -- the whole
column accelerated freely under PGF forcing (Probe 4: jet slab +19%
over the hour, 10 m drift 1.91x vs obs 1.27x, unmoved by an engaged
~2.7x stable-coefficient mixdown, because no force opposed the
acceleration).  The fix is the standard implicit surface-stress
bottom boundary condition, exactly YSU's pattern (authority
``npref.np_ysu_column``: ``fric = ust*ust/wspd1 * rho*G/delp[0]*dt2
...; diag[0] = 1.0 + fric`` -- npref.py:6495-6497, transcribing WRF
bl_ysu tridi's implicit surface stress; kernels/ysu.cu:493-496 is the
device twin):

    tau      = u*^2 * (u1, v1)/|V1|          [surface kinematic stress]
    F_bottom = -(u*^2/|V1^n|) * u1^{n+1}     [implicit linearization]
    c        = u*^2 / max(|V1^n|, SFC_WSPD_FLOOR)
    diag_0  += dt*c/thick_0                  [folded into the Thomas
                                              bottom row: I - dt*D_v
                                              + dt*(c/thick_0)*P_0]

with |V1^n| the PRE-STEP level-1 speed (the linearization's frozen
coefficient, YSU's wspd1 convention) floored at SFC_WSPD_FLOOR (the
audited sfclay floor ``wspd = max(..., 0.1)``, npref.py np_sfclay /
kernels/sfclay.cu, transcribed as a registered constant).  The
augmented matrix adds a POSITIVE diagonal term, so it remains a
strictly diagonally dominant M-matrix: unconditionally stable for any
dt, and the solution magnitude is bounded by the input extrema (the
drag can only pull the bottom cell toward rest).  Scope (each choice
documented): u and v ONLY.  w keeps zero-flux (the stress is
horizontal; the kinematic surface BC owns w).  The scalars keep
zero-flux (their surface fluxes genuinely arrive through the
sfclay/Noah HFX/QFX pathways -- a drag row there would double-count).
e-transport keeps zero-flux (its surface source is the existing
``sase_surface_e_source``; see the ledger restatement below for why
that source IS this drag's energetic partner).  The drag applies at
ALL f -- friction is not regime-dependent -- making this the lane's
ONE intentional cross-limb (f = 1) change: the f = 1 reduction pins
move wherever a fixture passes ``ust`` (re-pinned with rationale);
``ust=None`` remains bitwise the S3-6i formulation (no drag term is
ever formed).

RESTATED LEDGER THEOREM (S3-6j).  With ``ust`` given, the u/v
implicit solves ride (I - dt*D_v + dt*(c/thick_0)*P_0) with P_0 the
bottom-row projector.  On the uniform-dz box the implicit pairing now
telescopes to the bottom-face flux instead of zero:

    dKE_impl = sum_i u_i^{n+1}.(u_i^{n+1} - u_i*)
             = -dt*sum(P_v) + dKE_sfc,
    dKE_sfc  = -dt*sum_cols (c/thick_0)*((u1^{n+1})^2 + (v1^{n+1})^2)
             <= 0                       [the MEASURED drag work]

(derivation: the bottom-row equation gains -dt*(c/thick_0)*u1^{n+1},
so u^{n+1}.(u^{n+1} - u*) = dt*u^{n+1}.D_v u^{n+1}
- dt*(c/thick_0)*(u1^{n+1})^2; the first term telescopes to -dt*P_v
exactly as before -- interior faces are untouched).  The closure
statement becomes BOUNDARY-CONSISTENT:

    dKE + dE + dHeat = dKE_sfc,
    residual := dKE + dE + dHeat - dKE_sfc   [closes to roundoff]

-- the identity's right side is exactly the resolved-KE flux through
the bottom face, which leaves the ledger's control volume.  PHYSICAL
DESTINATION (documented, diagnosed, NOT forced closed): the KE the
drag removes converts to near-surface turbulence -- which is exactly
what the EXISTING driver-side source u*^3/(kappa*0.5*dz1)
(``sase_surface_e_source``, deposited into e BEFORE the step) models.
The two are the two ends of one physical flux: resolved KE ->
surface-layer shear production of e.  They do NOT match numerically:
the source is the neutral-similarity production integral over the
sub-half-cell layer at the frozen u*, while dKE_sfc is the resolved
drag work at the solved level-1 wind (a similarity MODEL vs a
measurement).  The mismatch is recorded per step as the DIAGNOSED
channel

    dE_sfc_src    = dt*sum_cols u*^3/(kappa*0.5*thick_0)   [modeled]
    sfc_conv_resid = dE_sfc_src + dKE_sfc    [modeling residual;
                                              diagnostic only, never
                                              enters the identity]

and deliberately left open -- forcing it closed would replace the
audited similarity source with the resolved drag work, a different
(and grid-sensitive) model.  With ``ust=None`` all three channels are
exactly 0.0 and ``residual`` reduces bitwise to the S3-6i statement
(x - 0.0 == x).

S3-9 amendment (GEOMETRIC dissipation-length regime blend; F-Y1
cold-water-body over-coupling, column-mechanism investigation
recorded with the campaign evidence, controller ledger
2026-07-21).  ROOT CAUSE (measured on the intermediate-nest run): the
LINEAR l_d blend rode the DOMAIN-LEVEL f.  As the land CBL deepened,
the domain f_used rose to 0.12-0.19 and every stable marine column
inherited the convective land's partition, handing the blend a
linear term f*delta = 360-580 m that JUMPS PAST the Blackadar/BL89
dissipation bound entirely; the only remaining cap,
l_s = LS_COEF*sqrt(e)/N, is state-dependent and inflates with the
very e it should limit (l_s doubles per 4x in e, and diverges as the
mixing destroys N), so production exceeded dissipation (P/D
1.9-7.1) until e equilibrated an order of magnitude high: e =
1-2.5 m^2/s^2 (restart truth 2.03), K_v = 25-112 m^2/s through the
jet face over 16-K-colder water.  The -250 W/m^2 surface cooling
never formed an IBL, every stability suppression this module owns
(l_s, BL89, C_KS, the Pr blend) keys on an N^2 that never forms, and
the cold-water-body surface welded to the jet aloft (sp10/sp500
0.65-0.94, growing with fetch).  THE FIX -- the regime blend of
:func:`dissipation_length` moves to log space:

    l_d = min(delta**f * l_eps_rans**(1-f), l_s)
          [was  min(f*delta + (1-f)*l_eps_rans, l_s)]

with l_eps_rans = min(l_B, l_eps_BL89) the untouched S3-6h
composition, l_s the untouched outer min, f the step's used
partition weight, and the ``lb=None`` (v0/LES) branch untouched.
ZERO new constants.  A length-scale blend belongs in log space: the
geometric form keeps l_d within a factor (delta/l_eps_rans)**f of
the RANS bound (~3.6x at f = 0.19, l_eps = 3 m -- vs 175x for the
linear form) while remaining EXACTLY the v0 LES length at f = 1.
ENDPOINTS FP-EXACT AND PINNED: f = 0 gives delta**0.0 * lb**1.0 =
1.0*lb == lb bitwise (every RANS column fixture -- jet, inversion,
log layer, Ekman -- unchanged bitwise), f = 1 gives delta**1.0 *
lb**0.0 = delta*1.0 == delta bitwise (the LES-limb reduction pins);
monotone (log-linear) in f between them.  EXPONENTIATION DOMAIN:
both lengths are strictly positive wherever the blend is formed --
delta is a positive filter width and the live lb = min(l_B,
l_eps_BL89) has l_B > 0 at layer centers (z >= thick_0/2 > 0 even at
z0 = 0) and BL89 lengths strictly positive by the E_MIN floor
(:func:`bl89_displacement_lengths` docstring) -- documented rather
than asserted, the module convention.  THE BLEND WEIGHT DELIBERATELY
STAYS THE DOMAIN f_used: the geometric form makes the domain/column
partition mismatch benign (l_d stays O(l_eps_rans) at small f), so a
per-column partition is NOT required here and remains open as a
separate gray-zone refinement.  The S3-6f cap's Gaussian-form
rationale was stated against the linear blend and is preserved
above as the historical record; the cap itself stands unchanged.
LEDGER THEOREM UNAFFECTED: l_d is a coefficient, never a channel --
it enters the step ONLY through the analytic decay rate b =
C_E*sqrt(max(e*, E_MIN))/(2*l_d), and the decay decrement D is
DEFINED as e* - e*/(1 + b*dt)^2 for whatever l_d the step computed,
so the e-channel closes by construction and the production/
dissipation pairing (identities (i)/(ii)) never sees l_d: every
S3-6d/6e/6j closure statement holds verbatim (asserted by the
ledger-closure fixtures under the geometric blend).  DELIBERATE
RE-PINS (the linear formula's own pins, the only two; derivations at
their sites): the interior-f closed form of
test_dissipation_length_blend_les_and_rans_limits and the split-step
trajectory goldens (tests/sase_goldens.py; BOX e 7.57e-4 rel, COL e
1.81e-4 -- the interior-f fixture).  RED/GREEN evidence (the
water-surface jet-decoupling fixture, tests/test_sase.py, profile
table, the cold-water profile fixture module): GREEN holds the 13Z onset
column in the land band (sp10/sp500 0.539 in [0.35, 0.60], e below
500 m 0.011 <= 0.3) under the reconstructed domain-f schedule, and
the frozen-wind 18Z coupled state builds the 12.8 K IBL (>= 10 K
band) the run never formed; RED (linear blend pinned back) shows the
throttled equilibrium (IBL 2.75 K <= 4 K, e 2.21 >= 1.0 below
400 m) -- the defect this amendment removes.  Registered decision
string: LD_BLEND_FORM = "geometric" (config-ID-bound).  The device
twin ``launch_sase_step`` mirrors the blend in S3-9b; until then the
GPU parity suite mismatches the authority BY DESIGN.

S3-9c amendment (GUSTINESS-CORRECTED surface drag; the S3-6h/6i/6j
adversarial review IMPORTANT-1, task S3-9c).  THE DEFECT: sfclay's
u* is computed against its gust-ENHANCED speed
wspd = max(sqrt(wspd0^2 + vconv^2 + vsgd^2), 0.1) (convective
velocity + subgrid gustiness; authority ``npref.np_sfclay``,
npref.py:4257-4266, device twin kernels/sfclay.cu:221-231), but the
S3-6j drag row applied that u* against the RESOLVED level-1 wind
alone -- over-damping every column where gustiness inflates u* (the
review-measured SASE/YSU stress ratio exceeded 2 in 10.3% of
outer-nest interior cells at 13Z, 95th percentile 9.54 -- the
registered outer-nest low-side/calm-tail bias of the first 12 h run).
THE AUDITED FORM:
YSU's momentum bottom row multiplies the drag by the
resolved-over-enhanced ratio squared,

    fric = ust*ust/wspd1 * rho*G/delp[0]*dt2
           * (wspd1/max(wspd, 1.0e-9))**2     [npref.py:6495-6496]

with wspd1 = hypot(u1, v1) + 1e-9 the resolved level-1 speed
(npref.py:6145) and wspd the live sfclay enhanced speed.
TRANSCRIPTION (geometric-height conductance): the S3-6j row keeps
its registered base and gains exactly that factor,

    c = u*^2/spd1 * (spd1/max(wspd, 1e-9))^2
      = u*^2*spd1/wspd^2,   spd1 = max(|V1^n|, SFC_WSPD_FLOOR)

-- identical to YSU's u*^2*wspd1/wspd^2 except for the PRE-EXISTING
registered SFC_WSPD_FLOOR regularization of the resolved speed (YSU
regularizes wspd1 with +1e-9 instead).  The two differ only where
|V1| < 0.1 m/s; there our conductance u*^2*SFC_WSPD_FLOOR/wspd^2
sits between YSU's exact u*^2*|V1|/wspd^2 and the uncorrected S3-6j
u*^2/SFC_WSPD_FLOOR (wspd >= 0.1 always), i.e. the calm-column
over-damping shrinks by the full (0.1/wspd)^2 <= 1 while the
divide-by-vanishing-wind guard survives.  SEAM DESIGN: ``wspd_sfc``
is an optional (ny, nx)-broadcastable input beside ``ust``.  ABSENT,
no factor is formed and the S3-6j arithmetic is BITWISE unchanged
(the no-gustiness identity); SUPPLIED with a no-gust value
wspd_sfc == spd1, the factor is (spd1/spd1)^2 = 1.0 and c*1.0 == c
bitwise (the identity pin the neutral no-gust fixture asserts).
``wspd_sfc`` without ``ust`` is rejected -- there is no drag row to
correct.  The driver threads the live sfclay ``wspd`` field
(physics._run_sase; sfclay refreshes it in the same due step, before
the split step, exactly as it refreshes ust).  LEDGER UNTOUCHED: the
factor folds into the conductance c BEFORE every consumer -- the
Thomas bottom diagonal and the measured drag work dKE_sfc ride the
same corrected c -- so the boundary-consistent closure theorem holds
verbatim for any c >= 0.  The e source ``sase_surface_e_source``
deliberately keeps the uncorrected u*^3 similarity deposit (it
models the sub-half-cell production integral at sfclay's own u*
scale; sfc_conv_resid remains the diagnosed mismatch channel).

S3-11a amendment (surface scalar-flux deposit; G-LAKE residual root
cause, the cold-water momentum root-cause record in the campaign
evidence, adversarially
verified 2026-07-21, zero refutations).  THE HOLE: sfclay's surface
sensible/latent heat fluxes never reached the atmosphere.  The
S3-6j scope note above recorded the premise "their surface fluxes
genuinely arrive through the sfclay/Noah HFX/QFX pathways" -- that
premise is FALSE (the note stands above as the historical record):
sfclay only DIAGNOSES HFX/QFX, Noah consumes them in the GROUND
budget, the e source consumes them for TKE production (discarding
the stable part), and NO code path deposited them into theta/qv of
the lowest model level -- the scalar vertical channel ran zero-flux
at the ground.  Over the cold water body the -80..-224 W/m^2 downward
HFX therefore never cooled the marine air: the surface-based stable
layer could not form, N^2 stayed ~0 in the lowest ~100 m, the
vertical channel kept its neutral-wall coefficient, and jet
momentum mixed continuously to the surface (sp10/sp500 = 0.73 vs
the 0.30-0.65 physical band); the warm-sector qv likewise had no
surface evaporation source (the P2 Td2 miss, the moisture face of
the identical defect).

THE SEAM (:func:`surface_scalar_flux_deposit`): the standard
atmosphere-side deposit -- the audited YSU surface-rhs rows
(``npref.np_ysu_column`` heat_surface/q_surface, npref.py:6472 and
:6481: ``hfx/(CP/G)/delp[0]*dt2`` and ``qfx*G/delp[0]*dt2``, which
under delp[0] = rho*g*dz1 are exactly the increments below) --
applied as an EXPLICIT deposit into the lowest layer BEFORE the
implicit K_v/Pr_t vertical solve of the scalar channel:

    theta[0] += dt*HFX/(rho1*CP_AIR*thick_0)
    qv[0]    += dt*QFX/(rho1*thick_0)

with HFX [W m^-2] / QFX [kg m^-2 s^-1] the SAME fresh post-sfclay
fields the e source consumes and rho1 the same lowest-level moist
density the e source computes (``physics.sase_surface_e_source``;
the driver threads all three in S3-11b).  EXPLICIT over IMPLICIT
(registered choice; the root-cause file's fix candidate 1 over
candidate 2): the implicit bottom-flux-row variant is identical
physics but extends the Thomas assembly; the explicit deposit has
the smaller blast radius, and stiffness is not a concern at the
steps that consume it -- the deposit magnitude at the pinned defect
state is |dtheta_1| = dt*|HFX|/(rho1*CP_AIR*thick_0) ~ 0.14 K per
intermediate-nest step (dt = 15 s, HFX = -180.2 W/m^2,
rho1 = 1.174 kg/m^3,
thick_0 = 16.8 m), bounded, and the unconditionally stable implicit
solve runs immediately after it.

RESTATED LEDGER (S3-11a).  The split-step theorem is UNTOUCHED and
holds VERBATIM: theta enters :func:`sase_split_step` READ-ONLY (the
buoyancy coefficient field and the BL89 lengths), the deposit runs
OUTSIDE the step in the scalar channel, and no KE/e/heat channel
changes -- dKE + dE + dHeat = dKE_sfc exactly as stated in S3-6j
(re-pinned beside the live seam by the S3-11a ledger fixture).
What the column GAINS is a real heat/moisture source, and its
closure is the scalar twin of the S3-6j boundary-consistent form.
For the composed scalar update phi -> implicit_solve(deposit(phi))
on any zero-flux column -- uniform dz OR dz_col: unlike the KE
pairing, this closure needs no uniform spacing --

    dTH := sum_k thick_k*(theta^{n+1} - theta^n)_k
         = dt*HFX/(rho1*CP_AIR)            per column, exactly,
    dQV := sum_k thick_k*(qv^{n+1} - qv^n)_k
         = dt*QFX/rho1                     per column, exactly,

because (i) the deposit changes sum(thick*theta) by
thick_0*(dt*HFX/(rho1*CP_AIR*thick_0)) = dt*HFX/(rho1*CP_AIR) --
the thickness weight cancels the increment's 1/thick_0 -- and
(ii) the zero-flux implicit solve telescopes its face fluxes to the
(zero) end fluxes, conserving sum(thick*phi) to solver roundoff
(the pinned conservation property of
:func:`implicit_vertical_diffusion`).  The right sides are exactly
the physical boundary fluxes through the ground face: the
atmosphere's heat/moisture content changes by exactly what crossed
the surface, nothing hides in a residual, and the theorem is
STRENGTHENED (a new exact closure statement) rather than weakened
(pinned by the ledger fixture at rtol 1e-9 of the increment --
~1e-15 of the column content, pure FP64 roundoff).  ZERO-FLUX
IDENTITY: hfx = qfx = 0.0 (the DEFAULTS) adds literally +0.0 to the
bottom row -- x + 0.0 == x bitwise for every finite x except -0.0
(physical theta > 0, qv >= +0.0) -- NO existing code path calls the
seam, and no existing function's body changed, so every pre-S3-11a
fixture and golden is bitwise-untouched (pinned by the zero-flux
identity fixture).  NO RETUNING: every SASE constant (C_KV, C_KS,
the BL89 lengths, the drag BC, z0 handling) is untouched -- the
closure produced the correct K_v collapse when handed a cooled
profile (the root-cause single-column reproduction); it behaved
correctly for the inputs it received, so the fix is the missing
forcing, never the closure.  MEASURED (the S3-11a lake fixture: the
18Z coupled state under the observed fixture-point
HFX = -180.2 W/m^2, frozen wind, f = 0, dt = 15 s): N^2(k0)
crosses 1.0e-3 s^-2 at 2.75 min and reaches 1.37e-3 by 10 min,
K_v(26 m) collapses 11.3 -> 0.19 m^2/s (59x) by 10 min (the
first-step 11.3 rides the run's coupled-equilibrium restart e on
the still-neutral slab), theta_1 cools 2.7 K -- against the
hfx = 0 leg's N^2 ~ 8.3e-6 and K_v ~ 2.97 (15x separation),
matching the reproduction's mechanism and magnitude (N^2 3e-5 ->
1.6e-3; K_v 3.74 -> 0.26, 14x, from its own spun state).
Registered decision string: SFC_SCALAR_FLUX =
"explicit-deposit-v1" (config-ID-bound, with CP_AIR).  The device
twin and the driver wiring (``physics._run_sase`` scalar loop) are
S3-11b scope; until then the production run lacks the seam BY
DESIGN.

SASE-M1 amendment (moist stability core; SASE-M spec
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-22-sase-m-design.md section 3, plan
Task S4-1, registered before implementation).  THE DEFECT (confirmed
by experiment, spec section 1): at gray-zone dx a saturated boundary
layer that is dry-stable (+4..+9 K/km) but MOIST-unstable (theta_es
falling 4-22 K through 0.4-2.5 km) is abandoned by the closure --
every stability pathway in this module keys on the DRY
N^2 = (g/theta) d(theta)/dz, which reads the layer as stable
(1.3-2.0e-4 s^-2 in the 11Z amplifier specimen), so the l_s/C_KS
stable-limit strangle holds K at 0.00-0.02 m^2/s and TKE at the
E_MIN floor (early-ci-cap-audit.md) while the trusted MYNN reference
sustains TKE 0.5-1.6 m^2/s and K_h 3-40 m^2/s in the identical layer
(sase-m-target-envelope.md).  The instability's only outlet is the
resolved scale: x11.5/h areal amplification, premature CI.

THE FIX: in SATURATED air the stability machinery evaluates the
Durran-Klemp saturated moist Brunt-Vaisala frequency N^2_m instead
of the dry N^2.  Durran, D. R. and J. B. Klemp, 1982: On the effects
of moisture on the Brunt-Vaisala frequency.  J. Atmos. Sci., 39,
2152-2158, their Eq. (36):

    N^2_m = g * [ (a/b) * (d ln(theta)/dz + (L/(cp*T)) * dqs/dz)
                  - d(qw)/dz ]
    a = 1 + L*qs/(Rd*T),      b = 1 + eps*L^2*qs/(cp*Rd*T^2),
    eps = Rd/Rv,  qw = qv + qc  (total water),  qs = qs,liq(T, p).

DERIVATION (the algebra; e_s << p and q << 1 class approximations,
DK82's own).  (1) Saturated-adiabatic lapse: a saturated reversible
parcel obeys the first law with condensation heating,
cp dT + g dz + L dqs = 0.  With qs = eps*e_s/p (e_s << p) and
Clausius-Clapeyron d(e_s)/e_s = L dT/(Rv T^2), the parcel's
saturation gradient along hydrostatic ascent (dp/dz = -p g/(Rd T))
is dqs/dz = qs*L/(Rv T^2) dT/dz + qs*g/(Rd T).  Substituting and
collecting dT/dz (using L^2 qs/(Rv T^2) = eps L^2 qs/(Rd T^2)):

    dT/dz * (cp + eps*L^2*qs/(Rd*T^2)) = -g * (1 + L*qs/(Rd*T))
    =>  -dT/dz = Gamma_m = (g/cp) * a/b.

(2) The bracket identity: for the saturated ENVIRONMENT, using
d ln(theta)/dz = (1/T)(dT/dz + g/cp) and the same environment
saturation gradient dqs/dz = qs*L/(Rv T^2) dT/dz + qs*g/(Rd T),

    Q := d ln(theta)/dz + (L/(cp*T)) dqs/dz
       = (1/T) [ dT/dz * (1 + eps*L^2*qs/(cp*Rd*T^2))
                 + (g/cp) * (1 + L*qs/(Rd*T)) ]
       = (b/T) * [ dT/dz + Gamma_m ],

so (a/b)*Q = (a/T)*(dT/dz + Gamma_m): the Eq.-36 thermal term is
exactly the environment-minus-parcel temperature-gradient difference
(the parcel follows -Gamma_m), amplified by a = 1 + L*qs/(Rd*T) --
the factor carrying the induced saturation-vapor buoyancy difference
(DK82 section 2).  (3) Loading: the displaced parcel conserves total
water q_w (reversible, non-precipitating -- the spec's own scope),
so the parcel-vs-environment condensate+vapor loading difference per
unit displacement is the environment gradient -d(qw)/dz.  Summing
(2) and (3) gives Eq. (36).  EXECUTABLE VALIDATION (the fixture
set): the moist-adiabat-neutrality fixture integrates the q_w-const
saturated-adiabat ODE d ln(theta)/dz + (L/(cp T)) dqs/dz = 0
independently of the transcription and demands |N^2_m| <= 1e-6 with
dry N^2 > 1e-4 (measured interior residual 3.9e-10); the moist-lapse
witness pins -dT/dz == (g/cp)*(a/b) on the same column within 1%
(measured 0.28% -- a swapped a/b errs 2.8x, a missing eps in b
~40%); the condensate-loading witness pins the -g*d(qw)/dz term
EXACTLY (linear-ramp shift, measured 1e-18 class).

DISCRETE FORM (:func:`moist_n2`; authority op order, the device
mirror's parity target): T = theta*(p/P0_REF)**(RD_AIR/CP_AIR);
e_s = 1000*SVP1*exp(SVP2*(T - SVPT0)/(T - SVP3)) [Tetens liquid --
the model's own saturation constants, the SAME e_s that formed the
qc the switch consumes]; qs = EP2_RV*e_s/(p - e_s); every vertical
derivative rides the SAME clamped variable-``dz_col`` stencil as
every SASE vertical operator (:func:`_ddz_var` -- quadratic-exact
interior, one-sided linear-exact edges).

SATURATION SWITCH (registered convention MOIST_STABILITY_SWITCH =
"binary-qc-or-rh100-liquid"): a cell is saturated when qc > 0 OR
qv >= qs,liq(T, p) (monotone-equivalent to RH >= 100% with respect
to liquid).  v1 is the spec's binary cell test; the assumed-PDF
cloud-fraction blend is the registered later hook (spec section 3
"the exact blend is the implementer's to propose") and must
re-register the string when it lands.  The switch output feeds a
np.where whose FALSE branch is the LITERAL dry
:func:`brunt_vaisala_n2` field, so unsaturated cells carry the dry
bits VERBATIM -- the M1 unsaturated bitwise-identity contract
(pinned by the control-column fixture: a fully unsaturated column
through the M1 pipeline is tobytes()-identical to the pre-M1 path).

SUBSTITUTION POINTS (spec section 3 -- exactly these, nowhere else).
:func:`sase_split_step` gains the optional ``n2_moist`` seam (None =
bitwise the pre-M1 step; requires ``n2``).  With the seam engaged,
n2_eff = n2_moist feeds

    1. the stability length l_s = LS_COEF*sqrt(e)/N -- every l_s
       evaluation site: :func:`vertical_mixing_length` (the LES limb
       l_les and the l_s term of the RANS l_mix composition via
       :func:`bl89_rans_lengths`) and the outer l_s min of
       :func:`dissipation_length`;
    2. the buoyancy production/destruction term of the e budget:
       where the moist field DEPARTS from the dry field (subst =
       n2_moist != n2 -- moist_n2 constructs the unsaturated branch
       bitwise-dry, so inequality identifies exactly the cells where
       the moist closure claimed authority; a saturated cell whose
       DK82 value coincides bitwise with the dry value is
       substitution-inert by definition), the term becomes
       -(K_v/Pr_t)*n2_moist; elsewhere the LITERAL dry expression
       -(g/theta)*(K_v/Pr_t)*ddz(theta) stands unchanged (bitwise);
    3. the stability suppression of K_v/K_h -- the same N^2-keyed
       pathway as today: :func:`stable_limit_coefficient` (rho, C_r)
       and the l_s bounds of point 1 riding n2_eff.

NOT a substitution point: the S3-6f w-sensor gravity-wave screen
keeps the DRY n2 (it classifies resolved-w motion against the
free-troposphere dry-stratification benchmark N2_SCREEN; handing it
the moist field would widen M1 beyond the spec's three points --
asserted by the seam-contract fixture's spy).  BL89 displacement
integrals keep the registered dry-theta_v convention
(BL89_BETA_CONVENTION -- moist parcel thermodynamics is the M2/plume
scope, C10).  [S4-3b amendment: the DRY displacement integrals are
unchanged, but the SASE-M1b section below adds a SEPARATE moist
excursion family on the n2_eff field as an additional master-length
bound in substituted cells -- the spec-3b response to the G-M3
deck-clearing failure.]

LEDGER (C4/C5, sase-m-integration-points.md): the theorem holds
VERBATIM.  Points 1 and 3 change coefficients (K_v faces, l_d),
never channels -- every closure identity is pointwise in the
coefficients (the S3-6f/S3-9 rule).  Point 2 changes the VALUE of
the buoyancy source, which the dE definition EXCLUDES from the
closed triangle (dE = ... - dt*sum(gb) - ...; the PE-exchange
channel, S3-6e) -- a measured-channel change, not a closure change
(asserted by the moist-substitution ledger fixture at < 1e-11).

MEASURED on the reference 11Z amplifier specimen column (a saturated,
strongly capped continental column; the specimen, its fixture module
and its provenance are recorded with the campaign evidence, not here;
frozen-state column equilibrium at
f = 0, converged by 90 min): the deck's DK82 N^2_m runs
-8.9e-5..+1.0e-4 s^-2 against dry +0.66..+1.8e-4 (sign flips in 4
of 7 saturated cells); saturated-layer mean TKE 1e-6 -> 1.015
m^2/s^2 (INSIDE the G-M5 band [0.5, 1.6]) and mean K_h
2.5e-5 -> 102.6 m^2/s against the dry leg's 0.00-0.02 shortfall
(early-ci-cap-audit reproduced).
G-M5 K_h-CEILING DEVIATION (registered, carried as a strict xfail in
the suite): the plan band [3, 40] m^2/s is NOT reachable by this
in-scope formulation -- at in-band TKE the equilibrium K_h =
C_KV*l*sqrt(e)/Pr_t is set by the module's shortest registered
length in the deck, Blackadar l_B = 82-114 m at 456-1391 m AGL
(the BL89 dry-parcel lengths are LONGER there once the moist release
removes l_s), whereas the reference's 3-40 m^2/s class carries the
MYNN master length ~10-20 m in-deck (its TKE-integral/harmonic
blend, a length family this module does not own).  Reaching the
ceiling would need new length physics (a fourth substitution point)
or case tuning, both scope violations; the deviation is pinned,
measured, and handed to the task review + the S4-3 smoke (G-M3/G-M5
on the 3-D run, where supply/radiation self-limiting operates).
Registered decision strings: MOIST_STABILITY = "dk82-saturated-v1",
MOIST_STABILITY_SWITCH = "binary-qc-or-rh100-liquid" (config-ID-
bound, with RD_AIR/RV_AIR/EP2_RV/XLV/SVP1/SVP2/SVP3/SVPT0/P0_REF).
The device twin (``launch_sase_step`` n2_eff) and the driver wiring
are S4-2 scope; until then the production run lacks the seam BY
DESIGN.

SASE-M1b amendment (moist master-length limb; SASE-M spec section 3b,
plan Task S4-3b, added under the FROZEN S4-3 adjudication rule "G-M3
FAIL -> spec amendment for a moist master-length limb, NEVER constant
adjustment").  THE DEFECT (measured, S4-3 smoke,
the sase-m1-residual record in the campaign evidence): M1 confined the
amplifier (13->14Z 35-dBZ growth x1.15 vs the x11.5 baseline;
amp-conditional intermediate-nest LE 105-143 W/m^2, inside the
post-fix class) but FAILED G-M3 by
CLEARING the Sc deck (ampfrac 10.1% -> 4.6% vs reference 60-84%;
coverage <= 0.47 vs bar 0.8; LWP p50 < 130 g/m^2 by 14Z; SWDOWN
1.7-2.0x reference).  Mechanism: in a saturated moist-UNSTABLE layer
N^2_m < 0, so every l_s evaluation is inactive and the master length
entering the dissipation/K pathway falls back to the FREE
(dry-convective) length -- at f = 0 the Blackadar/dry-BL89 class
(l_B = 82-118 m in-deck; the deck-under-lid fixture pins l_mix ==
l_B bitwise at the lid-adjacent cell), at gray-zone f the delta**f
side of the geometric blend -- and eddy diffusion at the resulting
K_h ~1e2 m^2/s (measured deck p50 74-120, p90 136-150) entrains dry
air across the capping inversion and destroys the deck.  The trusted
reference sustains K_h 3-40 in the same deck because its master
length is bounded by the capping stability.

THE FIX (spec-3b envelope; the discretization is this module's):
in M1-substituted cells the RANS-limb composed lengths are
ADDITIONALLY bounded by a moist parcel-excursion length of the BL89
family,

    l_mix_rans -> min(l_mix_rans, l_m),  l_eps_rans -> min(l_eps_rans,
    l_m),  l_m = min(l_up_m, l_down_m)
    [MOIST_MASTER_LENGTH = "bl89-n2eff-excursion-min-v1"]

with (l_up_m, l_down_m) the :func:`bl89_moist_excursion_lengths`
up/down excursion integrals evaluated against the M1 moist buoyancy:
the integrand is R(z') = int N^2_eff ds from the parcel level, i.e.
the DK82 field of :func:`moist_n2` (condensate loading included) as
the stratification measure, which in the dry machinery's own terms is
exactly beta*(theta_v(z') - theta_v(z_k)) with N^2_beta substituted
by N^2_eff -- the same accumulate-until-exceed construction, the same
quadratic-per-segment quadrature (:func:`_bl89_first_crossing`), the
same E_MIN floor and geometric surface/top bounds.  A moist-unstable
deck spends nothing on the way up (N^2_m < 0 stretches contribute
negatively) and exhausts its budget INSIDE the moist-stable lid:
l_up_m = distance-to-lid + finite penetration, never the free
fallback.  The min member of the pair is the family's own l_eps
convention and the unique conservative choice for a master-length
CEILING (the defect is OVER-mixing: the K-side bound must never be
slacker than the tightest excursion direction).  Discrete form:
N^2_eff held piecewise-constant per segment at the arithmetic face
mean (the module's face convention) -- R piecewise linear, outer
integral exactly quadratic; constant-extension end segments carry
slope 0; the centered n2 stencil gives one-cell level bracketing at
the lid (fixture-pinned).  ZERO new tunable constants.

APPLICATION POINT (coefficients-not-channels): the bound lives inside
:func:`bl89_rans_lengths` behind the ``n2_dry`` seam -- None (every
pre-M1b caller) is bitwise the S3-6h composition; the split step
passes n2_dry = n2 exactly when the n2_moist seam is engaged, so the
limb rides into (a) K_v's RANS limb (1-f)*C_r*l_mix_rans*sqrt(e)
(C_r evaluated AT the bounded length -- the S3-6i blend keys on how
close the operating length sits to l_s, unchanged logic) and (b) the
l_d blend's RANS input lb = l_eps_rans.  IDENTITIES: unsaturated
cells keep their bits verbatim (np.where's FALSE branch; empty-mask
columns skip the machinery entirely -- poison-pinned by the control
and lake fixtures); f = 1 is bitwise the pre-limb path (the
two-product K_v blend multiplies the RANS limb by 0.0 and l_d's
lb**0.0 == 1.0, both FP-exact -- the S3-6h f = 1 argument, pinned by
the LES-inert fixture on a SATURATED column); the ledger theorem
holds verbatim (lengths are coefficients, never channels -- C4/C5).

MEASURED (the constructed deck-under-lid column, spec-3b fixture
class: saturated moist-unstable 0.4-1.4 km deck, N^2_m -8..-20e-5
while dry N^2 +7..+9e-5, capped by a +12 K inversion; frozen-state
equilibrium at f = 0): the lid-adjacent moist-unstable cell's master
length leaves the bitwise-l_B fallback (115.4 m) for the
distance-to-lid class (54.8 m = its upward excursion) and its
equilibrium K_h leaves the 1e2 class for the reference class
(101.9 -> 39.3 m^2/s) while deck TKE stays turbulent (mean 0.614 ->
0.561): the limb kills LID ENTRAINMENT -- the G-M3 mechanism -- not
deck turbulence.  On the 11Z amplifier specimen the limb is
measured SLACK (every moist excursion exceeds the operating length;
min margin 0.02 m at equilibrium): the 11Z deck is still strongly
dry-stable, so the S4-1 equilibrium (TKE 1.015, K_h 102.6) stands
BITWISE and the registered G-M5 K_h-ceiling deviation (strict xfail,
[3, 40] vs achieved ~102.6) is UNCHANGED by this amendment -- the
limb's bite lives on eroded (dry-neutralized) decks and lid-adjacent
cells, where the smoke's defect lives.  G-M3 adjudication is the
S4-3d smoke's; the device twin LANDED at S4-3c (`aba886a` feat(sase):
M1b device + driver moist master length) and the S4-3d smoke ran with
M1 + M1b live on the production path, so the interim "the production
device path lacks the limb BY DESIGN" note this paragraph carried is
RETIRED (spec-sweep ruling 12).

SASE-M2 amendment (conditional venting limb; SASE-M spec section 4,
plan Task S4-4, registered before implementation).  THE DEFECT
(measured; sase-m1-residual.md M1+M1b section, S4-3d adjudication):
M1 confined the broad-sector amplifier (growth x1.15 vs x11.5) but
the Sc deck is destroyed by UN-TERMINATED RESOLVED VENTING --
residual plume cores of conditional LE 0.61-2.28 kW/m^2 over
0.05-0.25% of the inner nest with a 1.9-2.7 km transport tail carrying
220-230 W/m^2 at the intermediate nest where the trusted reference
carries ~15 (x14), plus the
SWDOWN/HFX breakup feedback -- and the controlled M1b experiment
FALSIFIED eddy-diffusion entrainment as the deck-destruction channel,
so the fix is a transport/deposit-side limb: a DIAGNOSED per-column
plume (:func:`plume_vent_flux`; no new prognostic state) providing
non-local scalar transport exactly where the gray-zone amplifier
lives, with a hard neutral-buoyancy termination (kills the tail) and
a condense-don't-clear partition (returns the vented moisture to the
1.0-1.8 km deck band -- the G-M3 rescue channel, adjudicated at
S4-6).  Scalars theta/qv/qc only; non-precipitating; no plume
momentum (spec section 2 physics calls).  Registered decisions
(config-ID-bound): VENT_FORM = "nb-terminated-vent-v1",
VENT_ANCHOR_RULE = "cloud-base-face-standdown-v1".

MASK (VENT_MASK; trigger on STATE, never activity -- w/TKE/echo
triggers fire 3-5 e-foldings too late, amplifier-anatomy section 5):
the limb engages on the column's LOWEST contiguous run
(>= VENT_MIN_RUN_CELLS = 2 cells, S4-4 review Minor-1: registered,
previously prose-only) of MEMBER cells -- cells that are BOTH inside
the M1 saturation mask (the ``n2m_mask`` argument -- the switch is
never re-derived here; the M1 seam owns it, and it can only VETO) AND
saturated on the registered VENT_K_LID_MEMBERSHIP total-water test
(MEMBERSHIP below) -- that is moist-unstable under the registered
theta_es reading.  THE REGISTERED OBLIGATION
(S4-1 review): the spec's "saturated layer with d(theta_es)/dz < 0
through a finite depth" admits two readings, and the 11Z specimen
FLIPS between them -- over the member run k12..k15 the bulk (run-top
minus run-base) theta_es reading is -1.525 K (unstable) while
adjacent-level monotonicity FAILS (interior rise +0.222 K at
k12 -> k13).  (MEASURED round-4; over the wider M1 mask run k10..k16
the same flip holds with bulk -4.469 K and interior rises
+0.006/+0.222 K at k11 -> k12 / k12 -> k13 -- the flip is a property
of the specimen, not of which of the two runs the reading is
evaluated on.)  BOTH readings
are implemented behind VENT_MASK: "bulk-theta-es-v1" (CHOSEN) and
"per-level-theta-es-v1" (theta_es decreasing at every adjacent pair
of the run).  Bulk is chosen because it is the reading the plume's
own parcel CONFIRMS (the S4-1 consistency criterion): the root
parcel's buoyancy above its LFC rides the INTEGRATED theta_es
deficit from the root level, not the local sign of d(theta_es)/dz at
every interior pair -- and the per-level reading would VETO the very
specimen that measurably amplified x11.5/h.  The flip is pinned by
fixture so the convention can never drift silently.

MEMBERSHIP (VENT_K_LID_MEMBERSHIP = "qt-ge-qs-v1"; S4-4 review
round-3 for k_top, EXTENDED round-4 to the WHOLE structural layer):
a cell is a MEMBER of the venting layer iff it is inside
``n2m_mask`` AND total water qt = qv + qc >= qs.  The run's base
k_base, its contiguity, and its top k_top all ride that member flag;
the root k_r is then derived from the theta_es structure (ROOT
below).  ``n2m_mask`` is retained as a pure VETO -- the limb still
never engages where the M1 seam says unsaturated, and the seam is
never re-derived here (pinned by the poisoned-mask leg of
test_m2_mask_discrimination_bitwise) -- but it can no longer EXTEND a
run.  The veto is provably never BINDING when the caller passes the
M1 switch itself: qt >= qs implies qc > 0 or qv = qt - qc >= qs,
i.e. implies ``sat = (qc > 0) | (qv >= qs)``, so member == (qt >= qs)
there; measured true on every registered M2 column (round-4 probe
r4_p8).

DEFECT THIS FIXES (measured, S4-4 review rounds 1-4): the M1 mask's
``qc > 0`` limb fires on sub-1e-12 kg/kg condensate DUST -- on the
specimen, cell k16 (RH 95.48%, qv 0.4767 g/kg SHORT of qs) qualified
for ``n2m_mask`` SOLELY on qc = 5.68e-14 kg/kg (5.7e-11 g/kg,
numerically zero), and cell k10 on qc = 1.05e-13 kg/kg.  Round 3 moved
k_top alone onto the total-water test; the run's BASE, its contiguity,
and the ebar window still rode the raw mask, so round-off-scale
condensate still swung the amplitude.  MEASURED at HEAD 3367244 (the
round-3 build), specimen export/supply, against the THEN-frozen band
[0.4, 0.6] -- superseded by the round-5 re-derived pin
[0.3553, 0.5584] (BAND STATUS below); the in-band / OUT labels are the
round-3 build's own and are kept as the historical record:

    qc[9]  += 1e-12  ->  root k_r 10 -> 9    ->  0.43850  (in band)
    qc[10] -= 1e-12  ->  root k_r 10 -> 11   ->  0.38422  (OUT)
    qc[16] -= 1e-12  ->  ebar window shrinks ->  0.44666  (in band)
    qc[17] += 1e-12  ->  ebar window grows   ->  0.36918  (OUT)

THE ROUND-4 FORM: qt's margin to qs is O(0.01-0.5) g/kg
(4.478e-5 kg/kg is the smallest |qt - qs| anywhere on the specimen
column, 4.5e7 times a 1e-12 kg/kg perturbation) and theta_es is a
function of (theta, p) ONLY, so k_base, k_top, k_lid and k_r are all
INVARIANT under +-1e-12 kg/kg condensate shifts at every cell of the
column (98 perturbations, round-4 probe r4_p5).  The FLUXES are not
bitwise invariant and no accurate reading of the closure would make them
so: qt itself enters the entraining parcel, so the response is
CONTINUOUS and LINEAR in the perturbation -- max relative flux
movement 5.84e-10 at 1e-12 kg/kg (worst cell k10), and the response
scales exactly with epsilon over four decades: 3.045e-11 / 3.046e-10
/ 3.046e-9 / 3.046e-8 relative at eps = 1e-13 / 1e-12 / 1e-11 /
1e-10 kg/kg on cell k12 (round-4 probe r4_p8).  Cells outside the
plume's territory move the fluxes not at all (bitwise).  That is the
property the fixture test_m2_layer_structure_roundoff_insensitive
pins.  (An earlier revision of this section claimed the fluxes were
bitwise invariant "pinned by fixture"; both halves were false -- no
such fixture existed and no shift inside the territory leaves the
fluxes bitwise unchanged.)

On the specimen the member run is k12..k15 (k_top = 15; the M1 mask
run k10..k16 is wider at BOTH ends -- k10/k11 are subsaturated by
0.397/0.148 g/kg and carry only dust condensate, k16 by 0.477 g/kg).
k_lid = k_top + 2 = 17 (INVERSION BASE below) and k_r = 10 (ROOT
below), and every specimen flux is BITWISE identical to the round-3
build 3367244 -- verified face-by-face on all three rows across every
registered M2 column (round-4 probe r4_p4).

ROOT (spec section 4, "Root": the moist-instability source level =
the theta_es-decrease base / most-unstable parcel level, 0.2-0.7 km in
the specimen -- NOT the surface, C8), DEPTH-BOUNDED at round 5.
Discretely: k_r = the HIGHEST interior theta_es maximum at or below
the member run's own base k_base AND at or above the structural depth
floor k_base - (k_top - k_base) - 1 -- the level at which theta_es
stops increasing with height and the decrease layer the run sits in
begins, subject to the source layer being no deeper below the run's
base than the run's own depth.  theta_es depends on (theta, p) only,
so the root carries NO condensate dependence at all, which is the
point of moving it off the mask.  FALLBACK: when
theta_es never increases with height below k_base (no interior
maximum -- theta_es decreasing all the way to the ground, which is
every constructed deck column) the decrease layer has no interior base
and k_base itself IS the source level, the classical cloud-base root;
that fallback is what makes the round-4 form bitwise-neutral on the
deck fixtures.  Constant-free: only the already-computed ``thes``
array and the run's own base and top indices.  MEASURED (specimen):
the only interior theta_es maximum at or below k_base = 12 is k10
(theta_es 334.4085 K against 334.3545 below and 334.2976 above,
z = 455.7 m), and the floor is 12 - 3 - 1 = 8, so k_r = 10 -- the
same root the pre-round-4 mask run supplied, now derived from a
condensate-free quantity and depth-bounded.

DEPTH FLOOR, WHY (design doc SASE-M2 amendment "root / anchor
separation", clause 1; the round-4 verification lane's real-field
survey): an unbounded theta_es-peak root violates the spec's own "NOT
the surface" clause on real fields and lands below 100 m on 6.49% /
6.09% of firing intermediate-nest columns (11Z / 13Z, probe
v5_p2_pop.py); those
columns exported a median 1.0142x the frozen supply at 11Z (0.2968x at
13Z) with 31.9% / 37.4% of them in the over-strength class below,
against a whole-population median of 0.4131 / 0.3667.  With the floor,
the sub-100-m fraction is 1.15% / 3.80% and the over-strength class
(export >= 2.5e-4 kg/m^2/s, the spec's ~4x-too-strong G-M4-killing
class) falls from 3.13% / 5.67% to 0.80% / 3.67%.  A source layer
deeper than the layer it feeds is not a plume source.

AMPLITUDE (column-local state ONLY -- C7; the closure signature
carries NO surface flux or w* input at all -- C8: the specimen
amplified at HFX -9..-28 W/m^2 while the reference confined with its

k_base through the entrainment-zone cell k_top + 1, i.e.
k_base <= k < k_lid (the BL-integrated subgrid energy, E_MIN floor).
Both ends are condensate-noise-immune indices (MEMBERSHIP above),
which is what makes the AMPLITUDE noise-immune.  THE ANCHOR IS THE
CLOUD BASE, NOT THE ROOT (design doc amendment, clause 2): this is
classical mass-flux practice -- M_b is specified at cloud base, which
is the provenance VENT_MB_COEF already carries (Grant 2001) -- and it
stops ROOT DEPTH from multiplying the amplitude, the shared mechanism
behind both defects the amendment names.  The round-4 window ran from
k_r; MEASURED on real intermediate-nest columns with real TKE_SASE
whose base sits
>= 2 cells above the root (n = 9046 at 11Z, 8089 at 13Z, probe
v5_p3_window.py) the round-4 amplitude is a median 5.81x / 2.76x this
one, p95 35.98x / 57.32x, max 401.8x / 469.3x -- a spread no
registered column can see, because e_sgs is uniform over the plume's
territory on every one of them (the deck fixtures by construction;
the specimen's M1-equilibrium e is flat to 0.4% over k10..k16).  On
the specimen the anchored window is k12..k16 against the round-4
k10..k16, worth a factor sqrt(1.016596/0.996808) = 1.00990 in
amplitude; the shape normalization (SHAPE below) moving from z_f[11]
to z_f[12] is worth 1/1.081185, and the two together take the export
from 0.814e-4 to 0.76074e-4 kg/m^2/s.  VENT_MB_COEF = 0.03 is
Grant (2001, QJRMS 127, 407-421), the cumulus-BL cloud-base
mass-flux closure M_b = 0.03*w*, transcribed with the velocity scale
re-keyed from the surface-similarity w* (identically zero in the
negative-HFX regime and forbidden as the sole amplitude source) to
the column's own subgrid turbulent velocity sigma_w = the isotropic
w-share of the layer TKE (VENT_SIGW_SHARE = 2/3: e = (3/2)*
sigma_w^2).  In a convective BL e ~ 0.5*w*^2 puts sigma_w ~ 0.6*w*,
so the re-keyed form is Grant's closure evaluated on MEASURED
turbulence instead of a surface-flux estimate -- the coefficient is
Grant's verbatim, NOT fit to this case (registered deviation: the
velocity-scale substitution is the C8 requirement).  REGISTERED
BRANCH (S4-4 review Minor-2): the re-key is applied LITERALLY,
M_base = VENT_MB_COEF*rho1*sigma_w -- NOT M_base =
VENT_MB_COEF*rho1*(sigma_w/0.6), the alternative branch that would
explicitly compensate for the sigma_w ~ 0.6*w* approximation used
above to justify the substitution.  The two branches differ by the
factor-1.67 ratio 1/0.6 and are NOT interchangeable: the literal
branch is the one whose export number is measured in-band (fixture
:func:`test_m2_velocity_scale_rekey_branch_pinned`); the compensated
branch over-vents (out of the [0.7, 1.1]e-4 export class).  The
sigma_w ~ 0.6*w* relation is cited ONLY to explain why the literal
substitution is a reasonable evaluation of Grant's closure on
measured turbulence -- it is NOT algebraically applied as a second
factor, and the chosen (literal) branch is what ships.  ``rho1`` is
the S3-11a lowest-level moist density -- the seam's own density
convention, single-sourced with the surface deposit; strictly
positive, rejected otherwise.

ASCENT: entraining moist parcel conserving (theta_l, q_t) under the
eps ~ 1/z entrainment family, eps = VENT_ENT_COEF/z with
VENT_ENT_COEF = 0.4 = c_eps of Siebesma, Soares & Teixeira (2007,
JAS 64, 1230-1248), Eq. (16) ("...can be well fitted with [Eq. 16]
with c_eps ~ 0.4", p. 1236) -- S4-4 review Important-1 CORRECTION:
the value shipped at S4-4 authority (0.55) was misattributed to this
paper; 0.4 is the paper's own constant (verified from the PDF) and
0.55 has no located primary source.  Their approach-to-top member
c_eps/(z_top - z) is deliberately dropped -- the hard NB termination
plus full in-column detrainment below it supersede the divergence
that term models (registered simplification).  Launch state = the
ENVIRONMENT of the root cell.  Discrete update per center-to-center
segment with the
environment held at the arithmetic face mean (the module's face
convention):

    phi_p(k) = phi_f + (phi_p(k-1) - phi_f) * (z_{k-1}/z_k)**c_eps,

the EXACT solution of d(phi_p)/dz = -eps*(phi_p - phi_f) for
eps = c_eps/z and constant phi_f (int eps dz = c_eps*ln(z_k/z_{k-1}) --

lowercase "c_e" spelling used pre-round-3 collided with the module's
OWN C_E = 0.93 Deardorff dissipation constant, an unrelated symbol;
retired).  Parcel
thermodynamics REUSE the M1 primitives: the SAME Tetens/Exner
expressions and constants as :func:`moist_n2` (the e_s that formed
the qc the mask consumes), theta_l = theta - (L/(cp*Pi))*qc, and a
fixed-iteration (VENT_SAT_ADJUST_ITERS = 12, S4-4 review Minor-1:
registered, previously prose-only) Newton saturation adjustment
(:func:`_vent_saturation_adjust`, derivation there).  Buoyancy is
the LOADED moist theta_v in parcel form,

    B = g*(theta_v_p - theta_v_env)/theta_v_env,
    theta_v = theta*(1 + (Rv/Rd - 1)*qv - qc),

condensate loading included -- the DK82/M1 buoyancy convention
(:func:`moist_n2` is its stratification-measure form); the binary
saturation adjustment is the registered v1 stand-in for the
assumed-PDF hook, exactly the MOIST_STABILITY_SWITCH contract.

TERMINATION (hard NB -- the cap-preservation and CI-fidelity
mechanism, C9): LFC = the first center above the root, BELOW the
diagnosed inversion base (see INVERSION BASE below), with B > 0; NB
= the first center above the LFC, at or below the inversion base,
with B <= 0; every flux face at and above the NB cell's BOTTOM face
is exactly +0.0 -- one-cell level bracketing of the physical lid,
exactly the M1b excursion pin's convention.  STAND-DOWN: no LFC
below the inversion base, or the inversion base itself is beyond
VENT_DEPTH_CAP = 4000 m above the root, returns bitwise zeros -- a
parcel that would punch the lid stands down and leaves deep CI to
the grid (G-M6; VENT_DEPTH_CAP is the shallow-device scope guard of
amplifier-anatomy constraint 8, "detrainment capped ~2.5-4 km", and
the C13 scope line "SASE claims boundary-layer and resolved-storm
turbulence, not deep convective mass flux" -- a scale-separation
bound, not an amplitude tune).  A THIRD, undeclared-until-now
stand-down (S4-4 review round-3, x2 lane Minor finding, RE-VERIFIED
against the round-3 k_lid formula): if the qualifying run's own top
cell IS the column's own top cell (k_top = nz - 1), there is no room
left in the column for an entrainment-zone cell at all (k_top + 1 =
nz is out of bounds), so neither a natural NB nor the k_lid ceiling
can ever be reached by the k-loop (``range(nz)``) -- the column
returns bitwise zeros.  (A run reaching only k_top = nz - 2, one cell
short of the column top, does NOT stand down this way: the
entrainment-zone cell itself, nz - 1, still exists and is reachable,
so a natural NB can still be found there even though the k_lid
ceiling, nz, is itself out of bounds -- verified on a truncated deck
column.)  Harmless in production geometry (a saturated run reaching
the model top is not a physical inversion-capped deck), but a real,
reachable branch (verified on truncated deck columns at both depths)
the S4-5 device mirror must reproduce exactly.  A FOURTH stand-down --
a run based in the LOWEST MODEL LEVEL -- is registered under
VENT_ANCHOR_RULE and lives at step 1a; see SHAPE below for its
derivation and its measured basis.

INVERSION BASE (S4-4 review Important-2, AMENDED round-3 -- coordinator
ruling, design doc SASE-M2 amendment "discrete C9 reading").  THE
CONTRACT: the plume's territory is capped at the layer the mask
diagnosed PLUS one buffer cell -- the DISCRETE ENTRAINMENT ZONE,
standard mass-flux practice for the cell immediately above a
diagnosed saturated layer (the reference's own inversion-band tail is
nonzero there too) -- never the capping layer proper.  k_top is the
run's own last ROBUSTLY-saturated center (VENT_K_LID_MEMBERSHIP =
"qt-ge-qs-v1", the total-water test qt = qv + qc >= qs -- see
MEMBERSHIP above); the entrainment-zone cell is k_top+1;
k_lid = (k_top+1)+1 is that cell's own TOP face index, structure the
column analysis already computes from quantities step 1 needs
regardless (qt_env, qs_env, the run loop), zero new tunable constants.
The LFC/peak/NB search is bounded to centers k < k_lid (through and
including the entrainment-zone cell); if the parcel is still buoyant
when the search reaches k_lid (no natural B <= 0 center found through
the entrainment zone), k_lid itself becomes the NB by construction --
the cap proper is an automatic ceiling on termination, never crossed,
and receives bitwise +0.0 on every row (cap preservation holds by
construction).

WHY A BOUNDARY IS NEEDED AT ALL (measured, S4-4 review, RE-VERIFIED
round-3 -- the original "coarse-grid artifact" diagnosis is FALSE and
is retired): removing the k_lid bound entirely and refining the
specimen's capping-inversion cell up to 32x (dz ~ 8 m at the lid)
does NOT make the unbounded parcel stop at the deck top -- it keeps
terminating at 1793.9 m (1785.1 m at the finest refinement), a
GRID-CONVERGED result.  The entraining parcel is genuinely, physically
buoyant into the smoothed capping inversion; the pre-round-2 "coarse
face-mean dilutes the near-top dryness a finer grid resolves" story
tested this claim against a fixture that ALREADY ran the capped code
(:func:`test_m2_termination_grid_consistency`) and so could only ever
confirm the cap it was supposed to be testing -- a circular argument,
now retired along with the "artifact" diagnosis it supported.  The
REAL justification is the design contract itself: SASE-M spec section
4's C9 clause ("venting never erodes the inversion... reference holds
MLCIN ~= 0 / MLCAPE 2200-2900 J/kg for 3.5 h without CI") MANDATES the
hard boundary regardless of why the unbounded parcel stays buoyant --
cap preservation is a modeling requirement, not a numerical-noise
correction -- and the amended C9 reading additionally requires that
the boundary sit at the entrainment zone's own top, not the bare run's
top, so the legitimate one-cell detrainment buffer is honored.

MEASURED (specimen, UNCHANGED by the round-3 membership fix and by
the round-4 extension of it to the whole structural layer -- see
MEMBERSHIP above): k_top = 15 (member run k12..k15; was 16 under the
raw/noise-sensitive test), entrainment zone = k16, k_lid = 17,
termination face z_f[17] = 1511.653 m (the SAME numeric face the
pre-amendment code computed as z_f[16+1]; the two formulas coincide on
the specimen because k_top itself moved 16 -> 15 exactly offsetting
the k_top+1 -> k_top+2 formula change -- recipient/zero structure
UNCHANGED there; the pre-round-3 docstring's "1512.1 m" figure was
simply wrong -- 1511.653 m is, and always was, the measured value).
Before the S4-4 review fix 100% of the specimen's detrainment landed
in the clear (RH 52%) inversion cell (k17, 1512-1794 m); after it (and
unaffected by the round-3 membership refinement), termination is
capped at k_lid = 17, and the degenerate empty-taper case (module
docstring below) detrains fully into the entrainment-zone cell (k16)
-- at/below the cap, never inside it.  On CONSTRUCTED columns whose
top was never noise-classified (the deck fixtures), the entrainment
zone is a genuinely NEW search cell the pre-round-3 code never
searched (see test_m2_termination_grid_consistency): termination now
lands at the deck's own physical top OR one cell higher (at the
entrainment zone's own top face), never at the deck top ALWAYS as the
pre-round-3 fixture assumed -- a real, intended widening of legitimate
search territory, not a defect.

SHAPE: M(z) = M_used*M_hat(z) on faces.  Below the buoyancy-peak
face M_hat grows by pure entrainment, d(ln M)/dz = eps, discrete
(z_f[j]/z_f[k_base])**c_eps (exact for eps = c_eps/z), normalized on
the CLOUD-BASE face so M_hat = 1 there and M_used is literally the
cloud-base mass flux M_b of the Grant closure (round 5, AMPLITUDE
above; was z_f[k_r + 1], the root cell's own top face, which made the
whole profile scale as z_f_root**(-c_eps) -- a root-depth
amplification).

THE k_base = 0 CASE -- VENT_ANCHOR_RULE = "cloud-base-face-standdown-v1"
(design doc SASE-M section 4, amendment "a surface-based saturated layer
stands the limb down"; audit-wave coordinator ruling).  z_f[0] = 0
identically (the module's cumsum convention) and F[0] = +0.0 by the
interface contract, so face 0 can never normalize a shape: a run based
in the LOWEST MODEL LEVEL has no cloud base to anchor on, and the
eps = c_eps/z entrainment integral diverges at z = 0.  The
pre-amendment reading anchored such a column at face 1 -- the lowest
face the shape can occupy -- which is the lowest layer's THICKNESS, not
a height, so the amplitude became a function of the vertical GRID
rather than of the state.  MEASURED at the design point over whole
intermediate-nest frames (S4-5c survey, post-step-4 active set, no
sampling): the branch
was live on 91/19495 (11Z), 661/25626 (12Z), 307/22179 (13Z) columns;
the 11Z median anchor face is 610.38 m where k_base > 0 against 17.08 m
where k_base = 0; the shape factor at a fixed physical face multiplies
by exactly 2**VENT_ENT_COEF per refinement doubling on the branch; and
the frame MAXIMUM export was a k_base = 0 column in all three surveyed
frames.  That breaks the C9 grid-consistency contract by measurement,
so the column now STANDS DOWN (step 1a, bitwise +0.0 on all three rows)
-- M2 is a cloud-base mass-flux closure and a saturated layer sitting
on the ground is fog or surface-based stratus, ED-limb (M1) business.
CONSIDERED AND REJECTED: M_hat == 1 on the branch, which keeps the
column firing at the Grant amplitude but leaves a step discontinuity
against k_base = 1 columns that the C9 continuity clause forbids.
Bitwise-inert on the whole registered corpus by construction, which is
exactly why the convention string exists: sase_config_id() hashes
constant VALUES, not code.  From the peak
face to NB the plume detrains with the remaining-buoyancy weight

    M_hat(j) = M_hat(peak) * sum_{c >= j, c < NB} B_c*thick_c
                           / sum_{c > kb, c < NB} B_c*thick_c,

which reaches EXACTLY +0.0 at the NB face (empty sum): full
in-column detrainment with zero shape constants.  Fluxes
(face-registered, the S4-4 interface contract):

    F_phi[j] = M_used * M_hat[j] * facemean(phi_p - phi_env)_j,
    M_used   = (1 - f_blend) * M_base,

facemean the arithmetic face mean of the cell-center parcel excess
(the module's face convention) -- the (1-f) factor is the FP-exact
two-product blend idiom: f = 1 multiplies by literal +0.0 and every
face is bitwise zero (the S3-11a zero-flux identity class); domain
f GATES the regime only, per-column amplitude stays column-local
(C7, the S3-9 lake lesson).  F[0] = F[top] = +0.0 exactly, ALWAYS
(the surface flux is owned by the S3-11a deposit -- double-counting
ban).  Units are dynamic: F_theta [K kg m^-2 s^-1], F_qv/F_qc
[kg m^-2 s^-1].

MECHANICAL INSERTION CONTRACT (C1-C3; the S4-5 driver seam): the
fluxes deposit explicitly in the driver scalar loop from the frozen
pre-step state BEFORE ``launch_implicit_vertical_diffusion`` -- the
registered deposit-then-solve order generalizing SFC_SCALAR_FLUX =
"explicit-deposit-v1" -- as

    phi_k += (F[k] - F[k+1]) * dt / (rho1 * thick_k),

NEVER inside :func:`sase_split_step` (the ledger theorem reads theta
read-only) and NEVER in a Thomas row -- for three reasons that stand
on their own: the transport is NON-LOCAL by construction (one anchor
level to every level up to termination), so it has no nearest-neighbour
tridiagonal representation at all; the deposit must be computed from
the FROZEN pre-step state for the scalar ledger to telescope and for
the registered rate caps to bind a KNOWN quantity BEFORE the solve,
neither of which survives making transport a function of the SOLVED
state; and the spec's section 7 registers any change to the Thomas
solver as a v1 non-goal.  The Thomas kernels stay untouched.
(Rationale RE-FOUNDED -- spec-sweep ruling 5.  This read "the solver's
pinned max principle is exactly what counter-gradient transport must
violate", which rests on the clause the design's counter-gradient
amendment STRUCK: the reference's subgrid heat AND moisture fluxes are
measured everywhere DOWNGRADIENT, reproducible by a pure ED closure,
with no countergradient term -- sase-m-target-envelope.md sections 3
and 6.5.  The ban is unchanged; its reasons no longer depend on a
struck claim.)  LEDGER (C4/C5): the M2 term is
a diagnosed coefficient -- no e drain, no momentum -- so the
split-step theorem holds VERBATIM, and the S3-11a boundary-
consistent scalar ledger extends with a ZERO net-column term:

    sum_k thick_k*dphi_k = (dt/rho1) * sum_k (F[k] - F[k+1])
                         = (dt/rho1) * (F[0] - F[nz]) = 0

exactly in exact arithmetic -- interior faces telescope and both end
faces are exactly zero; rho1 is a per-column SCALAR (the S3-11a
single-density conversion), so the thickness weights cancel the
deposit's 1/thick_k exactly as in the S3-11a closure.  RATE CAP
(S4-4 review Important-4 FIX, EXTENDED round-3 to a CAP FAMILY):
VENT_THETA_STEP_CAP = 0.14 K/step -- the S3-11a measured
stable-deposit class (this docstring's S3-11a section: |dtheta_1| ~
0.14 K per intermediate-nest step at the pinned defect state) -- bounds
the per-step theta deposit; VENT_QT_STEP_CAP = VENT_THETA_STEP_CAP *
CP_AIR / XLV (the latent/sensible heat equivalence, DERIVED from the
SAME registered constant plus two constants already shared with
:func:`moist_n2` -- no second independent tunable) bounds qv and qc.
DEFECT THIS FIXES (S4-4 review, measured): the cap previously bounded
theta only -- the moisture channel scaled unbounded with the amplitude
(measured 0.047 g/kg/step shipped, x16.5 at the theta cap's own
headroom limit, with nothing stopping it going further).  ROUND-3 CAP
FAMILY (x2 lane finding): a SUM-form bound on |dqv + dqc| alone is
identically VACUOUS on any column doing pure phase conversion (parcel
qt == environment qt, so F_qv = -F_qc exactly and the sum cancels to
+0.0) while the INDIVIDUAL rows still scale with the amplitude --
measured on the specimen, three cells carry (|dqv|+|dqc|)/|dqt| =
3.2-19.2, i.e. a single row can run several times the summed quotient
while a sum-only test sees nothing.  THE FIX applies VENT_QT_STEP_CAP
to |dqv| and |dqc| SEPARATELY, and there is NO separate sum term --
the family is exactly {theta, qv, qc}, still no second tunable.
(S4-5b Item 5c: this sentence previously read "alongside the sum",
which no implementation ever matched -- the registered formula below,
:func:`vent_deposit_rescale` and the device
``sase_vent_deposit_scale`` all compute the three-quotient minimum and
agree with each other.  The prose was wrong, not the code, and a sum
term is not needed: the per-row caps bound the sum within a factor 2,
since |dqv + dqc| <= |dqv| + |dqc| <= 2*VENT_QT_STEP_CAP by the
triangle inequality, with equality only when the two rows move the
same way -- and the pure-phase-conversion case that motivated the
family at all is the opposite corner, where the sum cancels to +0.0
and only the per-row bound bites.)  The S4-5 seam
enforces ALL of theta/qv/qc by a UNIFORM per-column rescale of all
three flux profiles -- uniform so the telescoping, the zero ends, and
the qv/qc partition survive:

    s = min(1, VENT_THETA_STEP_CAP / |dtheta|_max,
               VENT_QT_STEP_CAP / |dqv|_max,
               VENT_QT_STEP_CAP / |dqc|_max),

each quotient over the column's own max (not the sum's), so the
tightest of the four constraints governs; F_phi *= s uniformly
preserves telescoping and F[0] = F[top] = +0.0 exactly (verified: the
uniform rescale keeps the ledger residual at roundoff class even when
driven at 40x amplitude, while a naive per-level clip of any one row
destroys it).  DIVIDE GUARD (S4-5 implementation note): on an
inactive/masked-off column every |d*|_max is exactly +0.0, so each
quotient is +inf -- min(1, inf, inf, inf) still correctly yields 1.0,
but the bare division emits a numpy RuntimeWarning, which this suite's
``-W error::RuntimeWarning`` policy treats as a test failure; the S4-5
implementation must guard the division (e.g. ``np.where(dmax > 0,
cap/dmax, np.inf)``) rather than divide unconditionally.  EXNER-FACTOR
LOOSENESS (documented, not tightened): a STRICT latent/sensible
equivalence at level k is L*dq = cp*Pi_k*dtheta (Pi_k = (p_k/P0_REF)**
(Rd/cp) at THAT level), which would make the cap Pi-DEPENDENT and
therefore per-LEVEL rather than a single registered scalar; the
shipped VENT_QT_STEP_CAP drops Pi (~0.90 near cloud base), making the
cap ~11% LOOSER than the exact per-level equivalence.  This is the
conservative direction (a looser moisture cap never falsely blocks a
theta-bounded deposit) and keeps VENT_QT_STEP_CAP a single
config-ID-bound constant instead of a field; kept as-is rather than
multiplying in the module's own Exner array, a derivation trade
documented here rather than silently absorbed.  Specimen headroom
(MEASURED, S4-4 review round-3): theta 18.72x, qv 7.24x, qc 5.42x, sum
qv+qc 3.20x -- all comfortably under cap; the individual rows have
LESS headroom than the sum precisely because the sum benefits from the
qv/qc cancellation the individual rows do not get (the reason this
channel needed its own per-row bound rather than inheriting the sum's
margin).  ENFORCEMENT SCOPE: none of this is applied in
:func:`plume_vent_flux` itself -- the caps are REGISTERED and
CONTRACTED (config-ID-bound, hash-sensitive, specimen headroom
pinned) but enforcement is explicitly the S4-5 deposit seam's job, the
same status VENT_THETA_STEP_CAP has carried since S4-4 authority.
RESPONSE TIME: the limb is DIAGNOSED from the instantaneous state
every step -- engagement latency is one physics step on the state mask
(well under the <= ~10 min bound against the resolved 10-18 min energy
e-folding, anatomy section 5); the only spin-up it inherits is M1's
own e_sgs uptake, which is the designed coupling (M1 seeds M2's
amplitude).

CONSIDERED AND REJECTED (registered): (a) a CIN gate (stand down
when the root-to-LFC negative-buoyancy integral exceeds the seed
kinetic energy) -- it double-adjudicates the mask decision with the
amplitude's own quantity and VETOES the measured specimen, whose
subsaturated-root negative-B band (0.55-0.98 km) IS the DOWNGRADIENT
subcloud lobe this regime carries -- a downward heat flux through a
stably stratified subcloud layer is downgradient by definition, and it
is the reference's own signature there (-20..-150 W/m^2 at 0.4-0.7 km,
sase-m-target-envelope.md section 6.5): the resolved amplifier
realized exactly this structure as a LAYER overturning, not a
sequence of independent CIN-limited parcels.  (Relabelled -- spec-sweep
ruling 5; this read "IS the counter-gradient lobe the residual
demands", the clause the design's counter-gradient amendment struck.
The band, the measurement and the rejection are unchanged.)  (b) a plume
vertical-velocity equation (Simpson-Wiggert family) -- it adds two
disputed constants and terminates on w = 0 OVERSHOOT past NB, which
is precisely the 1.9-2.7 km tail this limb exists to kill.

out.  The cloud-base anchor is a 6.6% reduction on this column and did
exactly that, to 0.386 -- which the design doc's own amendment
predicted in advance ("a cloud-base anchor may move the specimen below
the 0.4 rail; a first sketch measured 0.386") while ruling that the
bands do NOT widen.  They did not.  The round-5 adjudication (design
doc section 4, "the export ratio is not an independent criterion")
found the two frozen bands to be restatements of ONE quantity -- the
fixture's supply is the registered constant 1.97e-4 kg/m^2/s, so
export/supply is a linear rescale of export carrying no independent
information -- with rails that never agreed ([0.7, 1.1]e-4 maps to
[0.3553, 0.5584]; [0.4, 0.6] maps to [0.788, 1.182]e-4, a floor and a
ceiling both outside the export bar's own rails), and RE-DERIVED the
per-column ratio pin as the export class's exact image.  The export
class itself is untouched and remains the PRIMARY bar.  0.386160 is
inside the re-derived pin, the fixture asserts it GREEN, and the
40-60%-of-supply claim is the BOX-SCALE aggregate registered as G-M7
form 2, never a per-column invariant.
HEAT-CHANNEL SIGN STRUCTURE (the "counter-gradient heat lobe" label
this paragraph carried is struck -- spec-sweep ruling 5; the negative
lobe is DOWNGRADIENT, which is what the reference itself carries):
cp*F_theta = -3.51..-7.65 W/m^2 at faces 502-887 m -- downward through
the stably stratified subcloud layer, i.e. downgradient, inside the
reference's own -20..-150 W/m^2 subcloud class -- with the positive
limb aloft (faces 1063/1270 m: +3.87/+31.68 W/m^2; the former 1512-m
third aloft face is now the exact-zero termination face) landing
INSIDE the registered never-large-positive layer-top class
(+13..+35 W/m^2 = w'theta' +0.01..+0.03 K m/s,
sase-m-target-envelope.md section 6.5), which is the requirement that
replaced the struck clause; peak transport at the 1270-m face
(LE 190 W/m^2, inside the anatomy's intermediate-nest conditional
class); condensate deposit +9.70 mg/kg per
60-s step into the 1270-1512 m cell -- the entrainment-zone cell, NOT
the clear inversion cell above it (Important-3 FIX: was +16 mg/kg
into the clear 1512-1794 m cell, pre-fix); TRANSPORT IS EXACTLY
CONSERVED within THE PLUME'S OWN TERRITORY, the root through the
entrainment-zone cell (k_r..k_top+1 = k10..k16 on the specimen --
test_m2_condense_dont_clear_partition; it contains but is wider than
the member run k12..k15, and is wider than the ebar window k12..k16
the amplitude now uses), with
48.8% of the condensate funding the entrainment-zone gain drawn from
cells BELOW 1.0 km (k10-14), not the "1.0-1.8 km band" the pre-
round-3 report claimed; the recipient does NOT saturate on arrival --
it evaporates the deposit for ~28 min (measured -161.6 g/m2/h
transient) before the cumulative gain finally saturates it, i.e.
discrete cloud-top deepening, never instantaneous condensation; max
theta deposit 0.0069862 K/step (20.04x under VENT_THETA_STEP_CAP),
max qv+qc deposit 0.01643 g/kg/step (3.42x under the derived
VENT_QT_STEP_CAP), max|dqv| 7.27 mg/kg/step (7.74x under),
max|dqc| 9.70 mg/kg/step
(5.80x under) -- the round-3 CAP FAMILY: qv/qc individually bound,
not just their (cancellation-prone) sum.  Every round-5 number in this
paragraph is the round-4 number times the single amplitude factor
0.9340467 (the ebar window 1.009877 times the shape normalization
0.9249114), because the anchor rescales all three flux rows
uniformly on this column -- structure, faces and ratios unchanged.
The control column, a
masked-off column, and the f = 1 LES limit all return bitwise +0.0.
The device twin and the driver deposit wiring LANDED at S4-5
(`1c3edc2` feat(sase): M2 device + driver deposit seam), so the
production path carries the limb: the interim "until they land the
production run lacks the limb BY DESIGN" note this paragraph carried is
RETIRED (spec-sweep ruling 12).

S3-12 amendment (ADDITIVE e^{3/2} DISSIPATION CHANNEL; gated by
``RunConfig.sase_additive_dissipation``, DEFAULT True since the
2026-08-17 real-data confirmation leg -- see the DEFAULT section
below).  This is the
fix LD_STABILITY_LIMIT_REJECTED named and did not attempt: it bounds
the stable-limb amplitude by ADDING a dissipation channel rather than
by removing the e-linear one, so dissipation is nowhere weaker than
HEAD's.

THE DEFECT, restated in one line so this section stands alone.  Where
l_s = LS_COEF*sqrt(e)/N binds BOTH the mixing and the dissipation
length, K_v = LS_COEF*C_r*e/N and eps = (C_E/LS_COEF)*e*N are both
LINEAR in e, the subgrid-energy equation is exactly homogeneous, its
specific rate carries no e at all, and below

    Ri* = C_KS/(C_E/LS_COEF + C_KS/PR_RANS) = 0.16471188169301373

the energy grows exponentially with nothing in the closure to stop it.
Measured on real GFS at 12 km: l_s bound in 65-100% of live cells from
9.2 to 14.3 km, median l_s 0.2-3.2 m against l_B ~ 146 m, e reaching
1.62 m2/s2 at 13.1 km and still doubling every ~3 min at t+60 min.

THE FORM.  Deardorff's length-dependent coefficient, written out, is
already two additive channels -- c_eps = c_eps,1 + c_eps,2*lambda/Delta
multiplying e^{3/2}/lambda is

    eps = c_eps,1*e^{3/2}/lambda  +  c_eps,2*e^{3/2}/Delta

-- and only the second divides by a length that does not depend on the
state.  S3-6k took the FIRST member (C_ES = 0.19 replacing C_E) and
measured RED.  This amendment takes the SECOND (C_ED = 0.51) and ADDS
it:

    l_ref = delta**f * l_B(z + z0)**(1 - f)   [neutral_dissipation_length]
    rho   = min(l_d/l_s, 1)                   [0 where N^2 <= 0]
    w     = rho**CKS_BLEND_EXP
    C_eps = C_E + (1 - f)*w*C_ED*(l_d/l_ref)  where N^2 > 0
    C_eps = C_E                               otherwise   [SELECTED]
    eps   = C_eps*e^{3/2}/l_d

(:func:`additive_dissipation_coefficient`).  Returning the effective
COEFFICIENT and not the rate is deliberate: the sum stays of the form
-K*e^{3/2}, so the S3-6d analytic decay substep integrates it exactly
with no new integrator and the ledger theorem holds verbatim.

WHY l_ref DROPS THE BL89 MEMBER -- this is the entire content of the
amendment and the trap a later lane would fall into.  l_d's RANS input
is l_eps_rans = min(l_B, l_eps_BL89).  The BL89 displacement lengths
solve a parcel-energy integral, so in uniform stratification they are
sqrt(2*e)/N -- proportional to sqrt(e), exactly like l_s, only longer
(which is also why l_s always binds first).  Divide C_ED*e^{3/2} by a
length proportional to sqrt(e) and the "e^{3/2} channel" is e-LINEAR
again: it breaks no homogeneity, has no fixed point, and would look
like a fix while being a rescaling of the defect.  MEASURED, both ways,
in ``test_additive_channel_needs_a_state_independent_reference_length``:
l_eps_BL89/sqrt(e) is constant to 2.5e-5 across four decades, and the
specific rate built on it is flat to 1e-12 across eight decades of e,
while the same rate on l_B spreads by more than 100%.  Only l_B carries
no e, so only l_B is admissible -- and at f = 1 the blend is ``delta``,
Deardorff's own Delta, FP-exact.

THE ALGEBRA UNDER THE NEW FORM, re-derived to the same standard as the
old (``test_additive_dissipation_breaks_the_stable_limb_homogeneity``;
N^2 = 3.566e-5, the measured 12.2 km value, l_ref = BLACKADAR_LAMBDA):

* HOMOGENEITY BROKEN.  Writing HEAD's specific rate as ``a`` (constant
  in e), the limb becomes de/dt = a*e - (1-f)*C_ED*e^{3/2}/l_ref.  Over
  eight decades of e the specific rate now spreads by 1.7 (Ri = 0.05),
  6.2 (Ri = 0.10) and 62 (Ri = 0.15) relative -- against HEAD's
  6.7e-16 to 8.4e-15 on the same grid.
* A FINITE FIXED POINT EXISTS IN THE BINDING LIMB, and it is an
  ATTRACTOR: sqrt(e_eq) = a*l_ref/((1 - f)*C_ED), matched to a
  log-space bisection on the authority-evaluated rate to 1e-6, with
  the rate positive below it and negative above.

* A CORRECTION TO THE RECORD, MEASURED, WHICH THE PREVIOUS LANE'S
  FRAMING DID NOT CARRY.  "The stable limb has no equilibrium
  amplitude" is exactly true WHILE l_s BINDS, and false of the closure
  as a whole.  l_s = LS_COEF*sqrt(e)/N GROWS as sqrt(e), so a cell that
  runs away eventually pushes l_s past the Blackadar length; there
  ``dissipation_length``'s outer min stops selecting it, l_d becomes
  the state-independent l_B, and the e^{3/2} dissipation comes back BY
  ITSELF.  At N^2 = 3.566e-5 that crossover is at e = 1.347 m2/s2 --
  which is where the measured runaway had just reached (1.62 m2/s2 at
  13.1 km, t+60 min).  HEAD is therefore BOUNDED, at a fixed point of
  2.8 to 39 m2/s2, and the correct statement of the defect is not
  "unbounded" but "bounded two to three orders of magnitude above
  anything physical, after a transit through a homogeneous regime that
  has no amplitude of its own".

  Full-composition fixed points, solved through the LIVE length and
  coefficient functions at f = 0 on a uniform-N^2 column (NOT the
  binding-limb closed form, which is valid only where its own answer
  lands below the crossover, i.e. Ri >~ 0.115):

      Ri     e_eq HEAD   e_eq ADDITIVE   reduction   l_d at eq [m]
      0.020     38.96        38.20          1.02x      147.7
      0.050     14.42        13.63          1.06x      147.7
      0.080      8.245        7.391         1.12x      147.7
      0.100      6.161        5.238         1.18x      147.7
      0.120      4.744        0.9567        4.96x      124.5
      0.140      3.694        0.2147       17.2x        58.97
      0.160      2.840        0.005976    475x           9.839
      0.180      0            0             --          --

  READ THIS ACCURATELY.  The channel is worth 5x to 475x in the
  Ri = 0.12-0.16 band -- which is where the defect actually lives, a
  hair under Ri* = 0.16471, and where the census found 72% of live
  cells against a 0.36% base rate -- and worth only 2-18% at Ri <= 0.1.
  It is not a uniform rescaling and it is not advertised as one.  The
  reason for the split is structural and is the design working: at low
  Ri the equilibrium sits ABOVE the crossover, l_s is already slack,
  the stability gate w = rho**CKS_BLEND_EXP has tapered the added
  channel off, and l_d = l_B is carrying an e^{3/2} dissipation
  anyway.  The channel fires where l_s binds, which is exactly where
  nothing else does.
* A CRITICAL RICHARDSON NUMBER STILL EXISTS, AND IT NO LONGER BOUNDS A
  GROWTH REGIME.  The added term vanishes as sqrt(e), so at the E_MIN
  floor the onset threshold is HEAD's 0.16471 to better than 1e-3
  relative -- turbulence still cannot START above Ri*, which is the
  registered property the jet and lake fixtures depend on.  Above the
  floor the effective threshold FALLS monotonically with amplitude
  (0.16465 at E_MIN, 0.16278 at e = 1e-3, 0.11978 at e = 1): that
  falling threshold IS the saturation.  So the limb keeps its
  bang-bang character at the floor and loses its runaway above it,
  which is exactly the pair of properties that lets the fix land
  without moving Ri*, C_KS, C_ES or C_E.  The absorbing state is NOT
  removed (S3-6k's "WHAT THIS IS NOT" paragraph still stands; the
  structural cure remains the EFB/TTE formulation named there).

THE TWO FIXTURES THAT KILLED THE PREVIOUS TWO ATTEMPTS, RUN FIRST
(``test_additive_dissipation_holds_the_two_calibration_fixtures``;
same engines, same registered criteria, nothing widened):

    leg               u10 min  u10 max  @3600  jetdev%   ibl_d74
    HEAD                5.701    6.580  6.580    0.063    12.7995
    additive ON         5.701    6.485  6.485    0.061    10.9009
    S3-6k C_ES ON       5.701    8.394  8.394    0.218     1.6433
    both ON             5.701    7.101  7.101    0.144     1.9497

Both GREEN.  The direction is the reason: every previous attempt
WEAKENED dissipation, and both fixtures are held by dissipation.  The
jet band gains margin over HEAD itself (6.485 against 6.580, band top
7.0).  THE LAKE MARGIN NARROWS AND IS RECORDED, NOT ROUNDED OFF:
ibl_d74 falls 12.7995 -> 10.9009 against a floor of 10.0 (28% margin
to 9%), with the column's peak subgrid energy below 400 m falling
2.2013 -> 0.8059 m2/s2.  A later coefficient move that spends the rest
of that headroom should have to see this number.

DEFAULT: TRUE, AND WHY -- flipped 2026-08-17 on the real-data
confirmation leg the 08-02 session left named and unflown: the 08-01
operational configuration (the `woof domain` 12 km NA emission,
GFS front door, 306x244x49) flown with this channel on, on the
gate that session set -- run completes, no TKE regrowth above the
BL, health gate silent.  Under fixed-means-default the channel is a
correctness remedy for the stable-limb runaway and ships default-on.
The paragraph that follows is the 08-02 status that governed while
the default was still False, kept verbatim because its blast-radius
measurement is the flip's own test plan.  Flipping
the default was measured this session: 9 of 242 tests move, and every
one of them is either a bitwise golden (test_split_step_trajectory_
goldens) or a RED leg that pins a HISTORICAL formulation stack
(test_jet_decoupling_red_current_formulation_exits_obs_band,
test_jet_decoupling_stable_dissipation_exits_obs_band -- whose
``u10s.max() > 7.356`` assertion the composed switch turns into 7.101,
i.e. the S3-6k RED is PARTLY REPAIRED by this channel -- plus the lake
RED leg, the fixed-LES-Prandtl inversion RED and four M2 tests whose
plume machinery reads e).  None of those is a physics failure and none
of them may be silently re-pinned: the correct handling is the module's
own idiom (each RED leg pins ``additive_dissipation=False`` exactly as
the S3-6j RED legs pin ``apply_drag=False``), and that is a default
flip with its own evidence, taken against a stable-limb calibration
target rather than against the goldens it happens to move.

C_E STAYS PUT.  The registered TKE deficit (e/u*^2 = 1.052 against an
observed 3.3-5.5) is untouched here, deliberately.  The trap recorded
at C_E is that lowering it RAISES the free-troposphere equilibrium 30x
because the stable-limb fixed point scales as (C_r/C_E)^2 -- and that
argument is about the HOMOGENEOUS limb.  Under this channel the fixed
point is instead sqrt(e_eq) = a*l_ref/((1-f)*C_ED) with
a = N*[LS_COEF*C_r*(1/Ri - 1/Pr_t) - C_E/LS_COEF], so C_E now enters
e_eq only through ``a`` and lowering it still RAISES e_eq, now
quadratically in a rather than as (C_r/C_E)^2.  The direction of the
trap is unchanged; only its exponent moves.  A joint (C_E, C_KS) move
therefore still needs a stable-limb calibration target, and this
amendment does not supply one -- it supplies the amplitude BOUND that
makes such a target measurable at all.

#: et al. diagnose as mixing far too much below the inversion; the

#: against an LES ~0.3 -- 3.7x low, independently reproducing the
#: registered "3-5x" claim.  It is not a bookkeeping artefact.
#:
#: (3) THE JOINT MOVE IS ADMISSIBLE AND STILL NOT WORTH TAKING.  Scaling
#: C_KS with C_E holds the depth inside the LES band all the way down,
#: exactly as the (C_r/C_E)^2 algebra predicts -- so the joint move IS
#: the right shape.  But it degrades the depth MONOTONICALLY

#:
#: WHAT WOULD CHANGE THIS: a second published target that scores the

#: THE SPELLING IS THE LITERAL, DELIBERATELY (S3-6k landing amendment).
#: C_ES and C_KS*LS_COEF are BITWISE EQUAL -- both 0.19,

#: mantissa (LS_COEF is ``52b81e85eb51e83f``: same mantissa, exponent
#: lower by 2).  That is a COINCIDENCE of two independently published
#: two-digit constants, not a derivation, and C_ES is NOT spelled
#: ``C_KS * LS_COEF`` here: doing so would make Deardorff's published
#: asymptote a silent dependent of this module's own diffusivity
#: calibration (the false coupling ``C_MOM_BG``'s comment warns about)
#: and would degrade the anti-tuning tripwire's independent
#: ``C_ES/LS_COEF == 0.25`` check into a restatement of C_KS.  What the
#: coincidence buys is ALGEBRA, registered in the S3-6k docstring
#: section: it places this composition exactly on the Gamma_m = 1 line,
#: where Ri* = PR_RANS/(1 + PR_RANS) independently of C_KS.
C_ES = 0.19
#: S3-9 registered CONVENTION string (bound into the config ID like a

#: THE DEFECT IT WAS AIMED AT IS REAL.  l_s bounds BOTH the mixing
#: length (bl89_rans_lengths, BL89_LS_DECISION) and the dissipation
#: length (the trailing np.minimum(l, ls) of dissipation_length).
#: Where it binds both, the two competing terms are linear in e
#: TOGETHER:

#:     K_v = C_r*l_s*sqrt(e)   = LS_COEF*C_r*e/N
#:     eps = C_E*e^{3/2}/l_s   = (C_E/LS_COEF)*e*N

#:
#: carries no e at all, and the closure has NO EQUILIBRIUM AMPLITUDE.
#: Below Ri_c = 1/(1/Pr_t + C_E/(LS_COEF^2*C_r)) = 0.1313 on the stable
#: limb (C_KS) and 0.3539 on the neutral one (C_KV), subgrid energy
#: grows EXPONENTIALLY, bounded only by the resolved shear being mixed
#: away and never by the closure.  Verified to relative 2.4e-15 across
#: eight decades of e, closed form matched to a bisection on the rate
#: itself to six decimals (the homogeneity pin in tests/test_sase.py).
#:
#: MEASURED on real GFS through `woof go` (d01 12 km, 2026-08-01T18):
#: l_s bound in 65-100% of the cells the closure had lit up at every
#: level from 9.2 to 14.3 km -- median l_s of 0.2-3.2 m against a
#: Blackadar length of ~146 m -- so the homogeneous regime is where the
#: closure actually operates.  Energy at 11-14 km reached 1.62 m2/s2,
#: 62% of the boundary-layer peak, still growing at t+60 min, in cells
#: 201-255x enriched in Ri < 0.25.  Those cells are 100% ICE-ONLY cloud
#: at k >= 33, which is why the liquid-keyed SASE-M1 switch
#: (MOIST_STABILITY_SWITCH, "qc > 0 OR RH100 liquid") is inert there and
#: why ablating it moved nothing above 8 km.
#:
#: WHY REMOVING THE MIN IS NOT THE FIX.  It does break the homogeneity
#: exactly as derived: with l_eps carrying no e, dissipation goes as
#: e^{3/2} against a production linear in e, the fixed point
#: sqrt(e_eq) = (l_eps/C_E)*N*LS_COEF*C_r*(1/Ri - 1/Pr_t) is finite for
#: every Ri < Pr_t, and NO Richardson number bounds a growth regime any
#: more -- the threshold moves to Ri = Pr_t and changes character, from
#: runaway onset to turbulence existence.  But removing a MIN can only
#: LENGTHEN l_d, and eps = C_E*e^{3/2}/l_d, so it can only WEAKEN
#: dissipation -- never strengthen it.  Measured weakening: 2000x at
#: e = 1e-6, 190x at 1e-4, 19x at 1e-2, 1.5x at 1.62 (N^2 = 1e-4).  It
#: therefore degrades every regime where the pre-change decay was
#: correct, and two registered calibration fixtures say so: the jet
#: decoupling fixture's 10 m wind leaves its obs band [4.5, 7.0] m/s
#: (7.93 -> 9.33 m/s) and the lake internal boundary layer collapses
#: (ibl_d74 10.0 -> 2.54).  Those are the regimes S3-6i and S3-6k were
#: built to hold; this trades them for the free troposphere.
#:
#: WHAT A REAL FIX HAS TO DO.  Bound the amplitude by ADDING an e^{3/2}
#: dissipation channel, not by removing the e-linear one -- e.g.
#: Deardorff's own length-dependent coefficient c_eps = C_1 + C_2*l/L
#: with C_1 = 0.19 (already registered as C_ES) -- so that dissipation
#: is nowhere weaker than it is today.  Not attempted here: it moves
#: C_ES into the default path, and C_ES/C_KS are recorded as jointly
#: falsified pending a stable-limb calibration target that does not yet
#: exist.  Same blocker as the C_E deficit above, and the same reason
#: not to invent a number to make one case land.
LD_STABILITY_LIMIT_REJECTED = "off-dissipation-length-v1"

#:
#: PROVENANCE, the SAME citation chain C_ES above already carries and

#: c_eps,1 = 0.19 (registered as C_ES) and c_eps,2 = 0.51 -- THIS

#: channels,
#:
#:     eps = c_eps,1*e^{3/2}/lambda  +  c_eps,2*e^{3/2}/Delta,
#:
#: and only the SECOND one carries no length that depends on e.  That is
#: the whole mechanism: Delta is the model's own scale, fixed by the
#: configuration and not by the state, so this channel is genuinely
#: e^{3/2} where the first is e-linear under a stability length
#: (LD_STABILITY_LIMIT_REJECTED).
#:
#: WHY THIS MEMBER AND NOT THE FIRST.  C_ES replaces C_E and can only
#: LOWER the e-linear channel (0.19 against 0.93): measured RED on the
#: registered jet gate, which is why RunConfig.sase_stable_dissipation
#: ships False.  C_ED is ADDED to it and is non-negative, so
#: dissipation under this switch is NOWHERE WEAKER than HEAD, pointwise,
#: and is bitwise EQUAL wherever the gate does not fire
#: (test_additive_dissipation_is_nowhere_weaker).
#:
#: THE SECOND PUBLISHED TRANSCRIPTION DISAGREES ON THIS MEMBER, recorded
#: rather than averaged away: PALM's SGS documentation carries the same
#: asymptote with a steeper filter-scale slope, 0.19 + 0.74*l/Delta, so
#: the two independent transcriptions agree on c_eps,1 = 0.19 and differ

#: citation, one family -- and because it is the WEAKER intervention:
#: c_eps,2 enters the stable-limb fixed point as e_eq ~ (1/c_eps,2)^2,

#: S3-12 registered CONVENTION string (bound into the config ID like a
#: numeric constant -- the FORM is formulation-level gate evidence, the
#: S3-6h/S3-9 string idiom).  Deardorff's second channel divides by
#: Delta -- "the model's own scale", which in an LES is the filter
#: width.  This closure spans two regimes on one partition weight f, so
#: the channel rides the SAME geometric blend :func:`dissipation_length`
#: rides, evaluated on the NEUTRAL member of each limb:
#:
#:     l_ref = delta**f * l_B(z + z0)**(1 - f)
#:
#: (:func:`neutral_dissipation_length`).  At f = 1 that is delta, the
#: filter width -- Deardorff's own Delta, FP-exact.  At f = 0 it is the
#: Blackadar length, this closure's registered neutral master length
#: (BLACKADAR_LAMBDA), which is what the RANS limb's energy-containing
#: scale actually is at mesoscale spacing.
#:
#: THE SELECTION RULE, stated so it is checkable: the additive channel
#: rides the STATE-INDEPENDENT member of the same length composition the
#: e-linear channel rides.  l_d's RANS input is
#: l_eps_rans = min(l_B, l_eps_BL89); of that pair only l_B carries no e
#: (BL89 displacement lengths solve an energy integral and scale as
#: sqrt(e), exactly like l_s, so a channel divided by them is e-linear
#: again and breaks NO homogeneity -- measured, the S3-12 docstring
#: section).  Dropping the state-dependent member is therefore not a
#: convenience: it is the entire content of the fix.
#:
#: CONSEQUENCE, registered: l_eps_rans <= l_B and l_d <= the blend, so
#: l_d/l_ref <= 1 always and the effective coefficient is bounded by
#: C_E + C_ED = 1.44 -- it can never exceed Deardorff's own neutral
#: total scaled onto this module's log-law-anchored C_E.

#: against 0.1f) -- so the SASE drag row can never divide by a
#: vanishing surface wind.  S3-9c clarification (adversarial review,
#: IMPORTANT-1): sfclay's own floor lives on its gust-ENHANCED wspd,
#: which enters this module as the S3-9c correction-factor
#: denominator (``wspd_sfc``); this constant regularizes the resolved
#: |V1| in the linearization only (YSU regularizes its wspd1 with
#: +1e-9 instead -- the registered deviation, module docstring, S3-9c

    the variable-spacing clamped stencil (a periodic vertical is

    One segment of the BL89 displacement integral (all FP64, vectorized

    piecewise-linear theta_v runs from theta_a (at the parcel-side end)
    to theta_b, the integrand against a parcel of potential temperature
    theta_p is beta*(theta(s) - theta_p) = (c1 + 2*c2*s) with

        c2 = beta*(theta_b - theta_a)/(2*h),

        I(s) = integral_0^s (c1 + 2*c2*sigma) d sigma = c1*s + c2*s^2

    -- quadratic in s, which is why the discrete integral is exact for
    every piecewise-linear theta_v profile (the quadratic-exactness
    class pinned by the analytic fixtures).  The parcel stops at the
    FIRST s where I(s) equals the remaining budget rem (>= 0): the
    smallest root of c2*s^2 + c1*s - rem = 0 inside [0, h].  Root
    finding is the numerically stable q-form (q = -(c1 +
    sign(c1)*sqrt(disc))/2, roots q/c2 and -rem/q), which degrades
    gracefully to the linear root rem/c1 as c2 -> 0; the exact c2 == 0
    branch is handled explicitly.  No root in [0, h] (including a
    negative discriminant) means the parcel traverses the whole

    (l_up <= htop - z_k); ``l_down(k)`` is the mirror image downward,
    integrand beta*(theta_v(z_k) - theta_v(z')), bounded by the surface
    (l_down <= z_k).  Unstable stretches contribute NEGATIVELY (the

    inversion's INTEGRATED buoyancy regardless of the local N^2 --
    information the local l_s = LS_COEF*sqrt(e)/N cannot carry.

    taken linear between adjacent layer centers, held constant from the
    lowest center to the surface (z' in [0, z_0]) and from the highest
    center to the top interface -- the sub-half-layer profile is
    unresolved, so constant extension is the accurate discrete choice.
    Each full segment then contributes its exact quadrature
    (c1 + c2*h)*h and the fractional last segment solves the quadratic
    I(s) = rem exactly (:func:`_bl89_first_crossing` has the
    derivation), so the only approximation in the whole construction
    is the piecewise-linear profile representation itself.

    (DK82 saturated N^2_m in saturated cells, condensate loading
    included; the dry field elsewhere); ``l_down(k)`` is the mirror
    image downward (R(z') = integral_{z'}^{z_k} N^2_eff ds), bounded
    by the column top interface and the surface exactly as the dry
    lengths are.  DERIVATION OF THE FAMILY IDENTITY: in the dry
    machinery the integrand is beta*(theta_v(z') - theta_v(z_k)) with
    beta = g/theta_v(z_k), which IS R(z') for the parcel-frozen-beta
    stratification measure N^2_beta = beta*d(theta_v)/dz -- so this
    function is the SAME accumulate-until-exceed excursion integral
    with the M1 buoyancy substituted as the stratification measure,
    exactly the spec's "excursion integrand is the M1 buoyancy".
    Moist-UNSTABLE stretches (N^2_m < 0) contribute negatively (the
    saturated parcel re-accelerates), so a moist-unstable deck spends
    nothing until the moist-stable lid: l_up = distance-to-lid plus a
    finite penetration -- the geometry the dry-theta lengths cannot
    see (they read the deck's DRY stability and stop parcels inside
    it, hiding the lid, while the free Blackadar l_B fallback caps the
    master length at the wrong scale entirely; the G-M3 defect).

    DISCRETE FORM (exact for piecewise-constant N^2_eff): the M1
    buoyancy exists as a FIELD at layer centers (s^-2), not as a
    potential like theta, so within the segment between adjacent
    centers the stratification measure is held CONSTANT at the
    arithmetic face mean 0.5*(n2_eff[j] + n2_eff[j+1]) -- the module's
    face convention (:func:`_face_average`) -- making R(z') piecewise
    LINEAR and continuous (R accumulated across segments as
    c1_next = c1 + N^2_seg*h) and the outer integral exactly quadratic
    per segment: :func:`_bl89_first_crossing` solves the fractional
    last segment with c1 = R at the segment start and c2 = N^2_seg/2,
    identically the dry quadrature class.  End segments (surface to
    the lowest center, highest center to the top interface) carry
    slope 0 -- the constant-extension convention of the dry lengths.
    LEVEL BRACKETING (pinned by the deck-under-lid fixture): n2_eff
    rides the centered clamped stencil, so a lid at interface z_L is
    felt by the segment BELOW the lid-adjacent center -- excursions
    terminate within one cell of the geometric distance-to-lid,
    (z_L - z_k) - dz <= l_up <= (z_invtop - z_k) on the fixture.
    ``e`` is floored at E_MIN (module idiom); with rem > 0 and the
    strictly positive geometric bounds (z_k >= thick_0/2), both
    lengths are strictly positive.  Zero new constants: E_MIN, the
    face mean, and the crossing solver are all pre-existing machinery.

    never be slacker than the tightest excursion direction (a lid
    60 m above must bound the master length at the 60 m class no
    matter how far the parcel could fall).  Unsubstituted cells keep
    their bits VERBATIM (np.where copies the FALSE branch), an empty

      the neutral log-layer constant exactly (in a neutral column the
      BL89 lengths are pure geometry, l_down = z >= l_B and
      l_up = htop - z, so the min leaves l_B bitwise everywhere except
      within ~l_B of the model top), and aloft it retains the audited
      Blackadar asymptote;
    * the l_s min on the MIXING length is the registered retention
      decision (BL89_LS_DECISION, adjudicated at the uniform-
      stratification fixture) -- applied here through the frozen

    Monkeypatching THIS function to return

    exact: the sum is still of the form -K*e^{3/2}, so
    e = e*/(1 + K*sqrt(e*)*dt/2)^2 holds with no new integrator.

    Four properties, each pinned, each essential:

    * NOWHERE WEAKER.  Every factor of the added term is non-negative
      and l_d/l_ref is finite, so C_eps >= c_base POINTWISE and the
      dissipation rate is nowhere below HEAD's.  This is the property
      LD_STABILITY_LIMIT_REJECTED lacked -- removing a min can only
      lengthen l_d, and this term cannot shorten it.
    * NEUTRAL/UNSTABLE BITWISE, BY SELECTION.  At n2 <= 0 or
      ``n2 is None`` the SELECTED ``c_base`` is returned, exactly the
      S3-6k gate (``if (has_ced && ls_v > 0.0f)`` on the device), not an
      arithmetic cancellation: c_base + 0.0*x is c_base bitwise only
      because the multiply is selected away, and the np.where IS the
      selection.  The neutral log layer, the C_KV**3 = C_E identity and
      every M1-substituted cell are therefore untouched.
    * LES LIMB BITWISE.  The (1 - f) factor makes the change RANS-only:
      at f = 1 the added term is exactly 0.0 for ANY stratification, so
      every LES fixture is inert with the switch on.  This is not only
      the S3-6i/S3-6k pattern -- it is required, because at f = 1
      c_base = C_E = 0.93 already EXCEEDS Deardorff's own neutral total
      c_eps,1 + c_eps,2 = 0.70, so the LES limb is not the limb the
      published coefficient is missing from.
    * STABILITY-GATED.  w = rho**CKS_BLEND_EXP is 1.0 exactly where l_s
      binds l_d (:func:`dissipation_length` ends with the same
      ``np.minimum(l, ls)``, so l_d == l_s bitwise and rho == 1.0) and
      falls off quadratically as the stability limit goes slack.  A
      neutral RANS column has l_d == l_ref and would otherwise take the
      full C_E + C_ED = 1.44, a 55% dissipation increase that moves the
      log-law slope by ~10% -- outside the log-layer fixture's 2% band.
      The gate is what keeps the wall calibration.

    ``l_d`` is the DISSIPATION length -- the length the coefficient
    multiplies; ``l_ref`` the state-independent reference of
    :func:`neutral_dissipation_length`; ``e`` the SAME field
    :func:`dissipation_length` consumed.  ``c_base`` is the coefficient
    this channel is added TO (C_E on the default path; the S3-6k

    from the unsaturated first guess T0 = Pi*theta_l.  f' >= 1 always

    iteration count (``iters`` = VENT_SAT_ADJUST_ITERS = 12, registered

    deposit/ledger/rate-cap contract, and the measured specimen
    numbers live in the module docstring (SASE-M2 section).  Summary
    of the algorithm (all FP64, vectorized over trailing dims):

    1. MASK/MEMBERSHIP: the lowest contiguous run (>=
       VENT_MIN_RUN_CELLS cells) of MEMBER cells -- inside
       ``n2m_mask`` (the M1 saturation/substitution mask, which is
       never re-derived here and can only VETO) AND saturated on the
       registered VENT_K_LID_MEMBERSHIP total-water test
       qt = qv + qc >= qs -- that is moist-unstable under the
       registered VENT_MASK theta_es reading; no qualifying run
       -> bitwise +0.0.  The run's base (k_base) and top (k_top) are
       retained; k_top feeds the entrainment-zone cell and the
       inversion-base diagnostic step 4 uses.
    1a. SURFACE-BASED STAND-DOWN (VENT_ANCHOR_RULE): a qualifying run
       based in the LOWEST MODEL LEVEL (k_base = 0) -> bitwise +0.0.
       There is no cloud base distinct from the ground for the step-5
       shape to normalize on (z_f[0] = 0 identically), and fog /
       surface-based stratus is ED-limb business.  The FOURTH
       registered stand-down condition.
    1b. ROOT: k_r = the highest interior theta_es maximum at or below
       k_base and at or above the structural depth floor
       k_base - (k_top - k_base) - 1 -- the theta_es-decrease base /
       most-unstable level of the spec's Root clause, bounded so the
       source layer is never deeper below the saturated run's base
       than that run's own depth (round-5 amendment, clause 1) --
       falling back to k_base when theta_es never increases with
       height below it.  theta_es is a function of (theta, p) only, so
       the root has no condensate dependence.
    2. AMPLITUDE, anchored at CLOUD BASE (round-5 amendment,
       clause 2): M_base = VENT_MB_COEF*rho1*sqrt(VENT_SIGW_SHARE*
       ebar), ebar the thickness-weighted mean e_sgs from the
       saturated-layer base to the entrainment-zone cell,
       k_base <= k <= k_top + 1;
       M_used = (1 - f_blend)*M_base (the FP-exact two-product blend:
       f = 1 -> bitwise zeros).  Root depth does not enter the
       amplitude at all.
    3. ASCENT from the run-base root: entraining (theta_l, q_t)
       parcel, eps = VENT_ENT_COEF/z, segment-exact update against
       face-mean environments; :func:`_vent_saturation_adjust`
       recovers (theta, qv, qc); loaded-theta_v buoyancy B.
    4. TERMINATION: LFC = first B > 0 center above the root and BELOW
       the inversion base k_lid = k_top + 2 -- the entrainment-zone
       cell (k_top + 1) and then that cell's own TOP face index
       (INVERSION BASE in the module docstring; this line read
       "k_top + 1", the entrainment-zone CELL rather than the lid index
       the code computes -- corrected, spec-sweep ruling 12);
       NB = first B <= 0 center
       above the LFC, at/below k_lid -- if the parcel is still buoyant
       when the search reaches k_lid, k_lid itself is the NB (S4-4
       review Important-2: termination never crosses into the capping
       layer above the mask's own run).  Stand down (bitwise zeros)
       without an LFC below k_lid, or if k_lid itself is beyond
       VENT_DEPTH_CAP of the root, or if k_lid is past the column top.
       Faces at/above NB carry exactly +0.0.
    5. SHAPE: M_hat grows as (z_f[j]/z_f[max(k_base, 1)])**
       VENT_ENT_COEF up to the buoyancy-peak face -- normalized on the
       cloud-base face, so M_hat = 1 there (round-5 amendment,
       clause 2; the max() is the structural statement that face 0
       (z_f[0] = 0) is never a normalization face, and since step 1a
       it can no longer BIND on an active column) -- then detrains on
       the remaining-buoyancy weight
       (exactly zero at the NB face).
    6. FLUX: F_phi[j] = M_used*M_hat[j]*facemean(phi_p - phi_env)_j
       for phi in (theta, qv, qc) -- dynamic units (F_theta
       [K kg m^-2 s^-1]; F_qv/F_qc [kg m^-2 s^-1]); the S4-5 deposit
       is phi_k += (F[k] - F[k+1])*dt/(rho1*thick_k).

    Inputs follow the module layout conventions (``(nz, ny, nx)`` with
    any trailing shape; ``dz_col`` per :func:`_column_geometry`);
    inputs are never mutated; ``rho1`` must be strictly positive (the
    S3-11a idiom) and ``f_blend`` in [0, 1].

    The reference implementation of the enforcement the S4-5 driver seam
    performs (module docstring, SASE-M2 RATE CAP -- previously specified
    in prose only, which an S4-5 review flagged as a prose-only parity
    target for the device mirror; this closes it).  Takes the three
    face-registered flux profiles :func:`plume_vent_flux` returns and
    returns ``(d_theta, d_qv, d_qc, scale)`` -- the CAPPED per-level
    explicit deposits and the per-column rescale factor:

        d_phi_k = (Fs[k] - Fs[k+1]) * dt / (rho1 * thick_k),
        Fs      = s * F,
        s       = min(1, VENT_THETA_STEP_CAP / |d_theta|_max,
                         VENT_QT_STEP_CAP    / |d_qv|_max,
                         VENT_QT_STEP_CAP    / |d_qc|_max),

    each quotient over the column's OWN max of the UNSCALED deposit (not
    over the qv+qc sum, whose cancellation on a pure-phase-conversion
    column makes a sum-only bound vacuous -- module docstring).  The
    rescale is UNIFORM across all three rows and the whole column, which
    is what preserves the three structural properties a per-level clip
    destroys: the interior faces still telescope, both end faces stay
    exactly +0.0, and the qv/qc partition is unchanged.  MEASURED
    (module docstring): a naive per-level clip of one row drove
    sum thick*dtheta to -3.74 where the uniform rescale keeps it at 0.0.

    ``s`` is applied to the FLUXES and the deposits recomputed from the
    scaled fluxes (``Fs``), NOT formed as ``s*d_phi`` -- the two differ in
    the last ulp and the module docstring's registered wording is
    ``F_phi *= s``.

    DIVIDE GUARD (module docstring): an inactive column has every
    ``|d|_max`` exactly +0.0, so each quotient is +inf and ``min`` still
    correctly yields 1.0 -- but the bare division emits a numpy
    RuntimeWarning, which this suite's ``-W error::RuntimeWarning``
    policy treats as a failure.  The quotient is therefore formed under
    an explicit ``where`` on a guarded denominator.

    LEDGER (module docstring, S3-11a scalar ledger extended): with
    ``F[0] = F[nz] = +0.0`` from the interface contract,

        sum_k thick_k*d_phi_k = (dt/rho1) * sum_k (Fs[k] - Fs[k+1])
                              = (dt/rho1) * (Fs[0] - Fs[nz]) = 0

    exactly in exact arithmetic (at machine precision in FP64), for any
    ``s`` -- the uniform factor cancels out of the telescoping.  The
    surface flux is owned by the S3-11a deposit, so ``F[0] = 0`` here is
    the no-double-counting contract, not an approximation.

    Inputs: the three ``(nz+1,) + trail`` face profiles, the step ``dt``,
    the per-column lowest-level moist density ``rho1`` (the S3-11a
    convention, strictly positive), and the layer thicknesses through the
    :func:`_column_geometry` contract.  Inputs are never mutated.

       docstring, S3-6j section): with ``ust`` given ((ny, nx) or
       scalar friction velocity), the u and v solves carry the
       IMPLICIT surface-stress bottom BC -- drag conductance
       c = u*^2/max(|V1^n|, SFC_WSPD_FLOOR) folded into the Thomas
       bottom diagonal (``implicit_vertical_diffusion`` drag_bottom;
       the YSU linearization).  S3-9c (module docstring, S3-9c
       section): with ``wspd_sfc`` ALSO given (sfclay's
       gust-enhanced speed, (ny, nx) or scalar), c gains the audited
       YSU gustiness factor (spd1/max(wspd_sfc, 1e-9))^2
       (npref.py:6495-6496); ``wspd_sfc=None`` forms no factor
       (S3-6j arithmetic bitwise), and ``wspd_sfc`` without ``ust``
       raises.  w, e-transport, and the scalar
       channel stay zero-flux (scope rationale at the docstring);
       the drag applies at ALL f (the lane's one intentional
       cross-limb change);
    6. explicit e sources: buoyancy -(g/theta)*(K_v/Pr_t(f))*ddz(theta)
       (the vertical-channel K_h at the S3-6g blended Prandtl number
       of step 1), horizontal e-transport
       ddx(2K_m ddx e) + ddy(2K_m ddy e) with K_m = the governed nu
       FIELD of step 3 (S3-6e harmonization -- one horizontal
       diffusivity serves stress, e-transport, and scalars), and the
       blended l_d (:func:`dissipation_length` with lb = the S3-6h
       RANS dissipation composition min(l_B, l_eps_BL89) and the live
       f) evaluated at e^n -- dissipation is NOT an explicit source
       any more (S3-6d);
    7. e update (S3-6d substep order, S3-6e taper): with the damping
       weight g (:func:`damp_taper_weights` when ``zdamp`` is given,
       else the FP-exact scalar 1.0), x = P_h,e + P_v, src = g*x,
       gb = g*buoyancy: e* = e + dt*((src + gb) + T_h) -- the withheld
       production (x - src) redirects to heat; ANALYTIC dissipation
       substep
       e* -> e*/(1 + b*dt)^2 with b = C_E*sqrt(max(e*, E_MIN))/(2*l_d)
       -- the exact solution of de/dt = -C_E*e^{3/2}/l_d over dt from
       initial value e* (module docstring; l_d frozen at its step-6
       e^n evaluation), unconditionally stable and positivity-
       preserving where forward Euler overshoots once
       dt*C_E*sqrt(e)/l_d > O(1); clip to E_MIN (clip_gain -> heat
       channel; the floor now engages only where the SOURCES drive e*
       below the floor); then implicit vertical e-transport with
       2*K_v faces (an M-matrix solve preserves the floor up to
       roundoff; a final floor folds any roundoff dip into the
       measured transport channel);
    8. heat = D - clip_gain + dt*(P_h,heat + (x - src)) with D =
       e* - e*/(1 + b*dt)^2 the EXACT per-substep decay decrement, the
       smag bypass, and the taper redirect (S3-6e; heat is no longer
       pointwise sign-definite -- module docstring); ledger with the
       split dKE pairing (explicit channel at u^n, implicit channel at
       u^{n+1}) plus the informational dKE_expl/dKE_impl breakdown;
       the measured buoyancy channel is the tapered gb.  S3-6j: with
       ``ust`` given the ledger carries the boundary channels --
       dKE_sfc (measured drag work at the solved level-1 winds),
       dE_sfc_src (the modeled u*^3 deposit), sfc_conv_resid (their
       diagnosed mismatch) -- and ``residual`` is the
       BOUNDARY-CONSISTENT dKE + dE + dHeat - dKE_sfc (module
       docstring, S3-6j section); all 0.0 with ``ust=None``.

    Scalars (theta, qv, qc, qi) are NOT advanced here -- their vertical
    channel is :func:`implicit_vertical_diffusion` with K_v/Pr_t(f)
    faces and their horizontal channel stays the explicit K_h machinery
    (km_h/Pr_t(f) since S3-6e/6g); the driver wiring is S3-6c scope.
    ``theta`` is read-only (buoyancy).

    SASE-M1 seam (module docstring, SASE-M1 section): ``n2_moist`` is
    the :func:`moist_n2` effective-stability field.  ``None`` (the
    default) is BITWISE the pre-M1 step; given (requires ``n2`` --
    the substitution mask and the w-sensor screen both need the dry
    field), it substitutes at EXACTLY the three spec points: n2_eff =
    n2_moist rides every l_s evaluation and the K_v/K_h stability
    suppression (steps 2b and 6's l_d -- points 1 and 3, coefficients
    only), and the step-6 buoyancy becomes -(K_v/Pr_t)*n2_moist WHERE
    n2_moist != n2 (point 2; elsewhere the literal dry expression
    stands bitwise -- moist_n2 constructs unsaturated cells bitwise-
    dry, so the inequality is exactly the cells where the moist
    closure claimed authority).  The step-1b w-sensor screen keeps
    the DRY n2 (not a substitution point).  The ledger theorem holds
    verbatim (points 1/3 are coefficients; point 2 is the PE-exchange
    channel the dE definition excludes -- C4/C5).  SASE-M1b (module
    docstring, SASE-M1b section): with the seam engaged, the step-2b
    RANS-limb lengths are additionally min-bounded by the moist
    excursion length in the substituted cells (the ``n2_dry`` seam of
    :func:`bl89_rans_lengths`); n2_moist=None remains bitwise the
    pre-M1 step and f = 1 remains bitwise the pre-limb path.

    S3-6k seam (module docstring, S3-6k section):
    ``stable_dissipation=False`` (the default) evaluates the LITERAL
    ``C_E*np.sqrt(...)`` decay coefficient of step 7 and forms no
    coefficient array at all -- bitwise the pre-S3-6k step by
    construction, not by cancellation.  True replaces that scalar with
    the per-cell :func:`stable_dissipation_coefficient` evaluated on the
    SAME (l_d, e, n2_eff, f) the step already holds, so where l_s binds
    l_d the limb dissipates at C_ES*e*N/LS_COEF instead of
    C_E*e*N/LS_COEF.  NOTHING else moves: not l_d, not K_v, not l_s, not
    the M1 seam, not the ledger's own channel definitions (a
    coefficient change inside the analytic decay substep is measured by
    D = e* - e_dec exactly as before, so the theorem holds verbatim).

    S3-12 seam (module docstring, S3-12 section):
    ``additive_dissipation=False`` (the default) leaves the line above
    untouched, so HEAD is bitwise the pre-S3-12 step by construction.
    True ADDS Deardorff's second, grid-scale dissipation channel to
    whichever base coefficient the S3-6k line selected --
    :func:`additive_dissipation_coefficient` on the SAME (l_d, e,
    n2_eff, f) plus the state-independent
    :func:`neutral_dissipation_length` -- so the decay coefficient is
    NOWHERE below the one this step would otherwise use and the
    stable limb gains a dissipation term that is genuinely e^{3/2}.
    The two switches COMPOSE (S3-6k selects the base, S3-12 adds to
    it); each is registered independently in the config ID.  Nothing
    else moves -- not l_d, not K_v, not l_s, not the M1 seam, not the
    ledger's channel definitions: the sum is still of the form
    -K*e^{3/2}, so the analytic decay substep and the theorem's
    D = e* - e_dec both hold verbatim.

    On the uniform-dz horizontally periodic box the returned ledger
    closes to relative roundoff (theorem, pinned < 1e-11); variable
    ``dz_col`` columns are diagnostic-only exactly as in v0.

    """Neutral constant-stress column: the log-layer fixture engine.

    A 1-D column driven toward the neutral constant-flux equilibrium of
    the amended vertical channel: a prescribed momentum flux u*^2
    enters through the top face and exits through the surface (explicit
    end-face sources; the interior faces are the zero-flux Thomas
    solve), so the steady state carries flux u*^2 through every
    interior face and the profile shape satisfies K_v*du/dz = u*^2.
    The e budget runs P_v (implicit-flux pairing), dissipation over
    the RANS dissipation length, implicit 2*K_v e-transport, and the
    model's named surface e source (the shear term of
    ``physics.sase_surface_e_source``, u*^3/(k*0.5*dz)): the discrete
    face production only sees shear at z >= dz, so the source stands in
    for the sub-half-cell surface-layer production u*^3/(k*z) exactly
    as it does in the driver -- without it the surface cell's e (and
    hence K_v) sits ~50% low, which is the model-configuration defect
    the source exists to fix.  S3-6h: the engine runs the COMPOSED
    RANS-limb lengths (:func:`bl89_rans_lengths` at the f = 0 blend
    limit, uniform theta) instead of the bare l_B, so the fixture
    witnesses the live formulation's kappa-z match (the hard
    constraint).  In a neutral column the BL89 lengths are pure
    geometry (l_down = z >= l_B, l_up = htop - z; zero integrand means
    no crossing can occur and l_les = l_B exactly with n2 absent), so
    they are CONSTANT in time and hoisted out of the loop; the min
    leaves l_B bitwise below ~htop - l_B and only the top few cells
    shorten.  The neutral fixed point is unchanged where mixing and
    dissipation ride the same length (production = dissipation gives
    e = C_E^{-2/3}*u*^2 independent of l -- the C_KV derivation);
    measured window shifts vs the pre-S3-6h engine: K_v < 0.8%

    the jet and lake fixtures run REAL frames, which pin what this

    itself.  The forcing is deliberately spelled as arguments -- the
    benchmark's own numbers live with the benchmark
    (:mod:`woof.verify.cases.gabls1`), never here.

    THE COLUMN.  An f-plane with a prescribed constant geostrophic wind
    (``geo_u``, ``geo_v``), the same simultaneous explicit forcing
    ``column_ekman_balance`` uses,

        du += dt*fcor*(v - geo_v),   dv += -dt*fcor*(u - geo_u),

    [K s^-1].  Surface momentum and heat both come from the SAME
    Monin-Obukhov solve (:func:`_mo_surface_stable`) on the stable
    Businger-Dyer limb, so the surface layer is the benchmark's, not
    this closure's: the momentum row enters the implicit solve as the

    bottom boundary condition) and the heat row as the explicit
    bottom-cell deposit dt*u**theta*/thick_0 (SFC_SCALAR_FLUX, the

               two switches select, exactly as sase_split_step forms it

    with e advanced by shear production on the solved faces, buoyancy
    destruction -K_h*N^2, the analytic decay, and the implicit 2*K_v
    e-transport -- the split step's own order of operations, minus the
    horizontal channel a single column does not have.  ``delta`` is
    irrelevant at f = 0 (the geometric blend returns l_eps_rans
    FP-exactly) and the additive channel's reference length is
    l_B(z + z0) there, likewise independent of it.

    surface potential temperature and the kinematic heat flux per
    step), which is what a benchmark scores.  The boundary-layer depth
    is NOT computed here: its definition belongs to the benchmark
    (there are several, and they disagree), so the caller gets the
    stress profile and applies its own.

      The step map is u^{n+1} = M^{-1}(u^n + dt*f*(v^n - vg)) with
      M = I - dt*D_v + dt*(c/thick_0)*P_0; at a fixed point,

      -- integrated PGF equals surface stress componentwise, to FP
      tolerance limited only by residual spin-up transients.

      drag law (kappa*G/u*)^2 = (ln(u*/(f*z0)) - A)^2 + B^2 with the

      places the level-1 (z1 = dz/2) wind; the fixture's GREEN band
      widens that point for closure spread (band derivation at the
      test).
    * CROSS-ISOBAR ANGLE -- the surface wind turns toward low
      pressure (+v for geo = (G, 0)); observed/theoretical neutral
      barotropic range ~10-35 degrees (Ekman 45 deg is the constant-K
      idealization; similarity layers sit shallower).

    RED limb (drag=False): from rest the column stays HORIZONTALLY
    uniform (the PGF tendency is z-independent and D_v of a uniform
    profile is zero), so the trajectory is the exact discrete inertial
    spiral Z^{n+1} = (1 - i*fcor*dt)*Z^n, Z = (u - ug) + i*(v - vg),

    and the forward-Euler factor |1 - i*f*dt| > 1 amplifies secularly
    -- NO equilibrium exists without the drag term.  That unbounded
    drift is the regression tripwire for the missing-force class.

    Starts from REST (u = v = 0, e = E_MIN).  Returns the final
