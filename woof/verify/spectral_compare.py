"""Scale-resolved model-to-reference comparison for limited-area fields.

This module is deliberately additive to :mod:`woof.verify.spectral`.
The existing ``gpuwm.spectral-pins/v1`` metric is a frozen chaos-envelope
class for column-maximum W and reflectivity.  It must not be widened or
re-pinned to serve a different question.  This module answers the broader
model-verification question instead:

* how much variance/kinetic energy each run carries in physical wavelength
  bands;
* whether the amplitudes agree;
* whether the structures are in phase/in the same places;
* how much error remains after amplitude mismatch is removed; and
* for horizontal wind, whether that energy is rotational or divergent.

The transform is a two-dimensional Fourier analysis of a detrended,
unit-mean-square Hann-windowed regional plane.  Only the circular disk through
the smaller axis Nyquist is admitted, so every retained radial wavenumber has
complete directional support.  The DC mode is excluded.  All reductions and
sums are float64.

No empirical pass threshold lives here.  A campaign pre-registers wavelength
bands and any gates in a receipt registration; this module only supplies the
pinned arithmetic.

# Calibrated constants.  Each was MEASURED before it was written down, and

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: How many ulp of slack a declared band edge gets before the inclusive/
#: exclusive rule is applied.  A retained mode's wavelength is recovered as
#: ``1/|k|``, and that round trip is not exact: measured over 110 grids
#: (n 64..600, dx 250..12000 m) the recovered wavelength differs from the
#: double-rounded exact wavelength by at most 3 ulp.  Eight is the allowance
#: :func:`mode_geometry` already applies at the Nyquist edge, so the module
#: carries one constant rather than two, and it clears the measurement by
#: 2.7x.  It cannot merge two physically distinct modes: adjacent radial
#: modes are at least ``2/n`` apart in relative wavelength -- 3.3e-3 at
#: n=600 -- against 8 ulp = 1.8e-15.
BAND_EDGE_ULP_ALLOWANCE = 8

#: Band power, as a fraction of the plane's own mean square, below which the
#: band carries no resolvable variance and is reported ``unresolved`` rather
#: than scored.  MEASURED 2026-08-20, both ends of the gap this divides:
#:
#: * constant planes (84 cases, n=8..512, 12 physically plausible constants
#:   including 273.15, 1013.25, 101325.0): the detrend leaves float
#:   cancellation residue, and the retained-disk power over the plane's mean
#:   square peaked at 2.784e-31 -- an amplitude of 2.4 eps;
#: * real structure at the float32 storage quantization limit, which is the
#:   finest structure a history file can carry at all: 1.24e-14.
#:
#: 1e-22 sits 8.6 decades above the noise ceiling and 8.1 decades below the
#: signal floor, near the geometric centre of a gap 16.6 decades wide.
VARIANCE_FLOOR_RELATIVE_POWER = 1e-22

#: The tolerance under which two boxes scoring the same input bytes with the
#: same code agree.  MEASURED 2026-08-20 on sha256-identical input and module
#: bytes: the Windows desktop (Python 3.13.7, numpy 2.2.6, UCRT) against
#: a development machine (Python 3.14.4, numpy 2.3.5, glibc 2.43), over two
#: independent pairs -- a 192x192 scalar+vector probe with displaced and
#: rescaled fields, and a 128x128 pair scored through the real
#: ``woof spectral run`` door with the candidate a PURE rescaling of the
#: reference, which drives every phase metric to analytic zero.
#:
#: 489 metric values compared, 169 bit-identical.  Worst disagreement by
#: class: 1.1102e-14 bounded (phase_location_fraction_of_error), 7.7498e-15
#: unbounded ratio (normalized_error_power), 7.7304e-16 of the band's
#: reference power (error_power), and ZERO in the exact class -- band
#: membership and mode counts agreed everywhere.  Repeating a run on either
#: box reproduced it to the bit, so the spread is the boxes, not the run.
#:
#: 1e-12 clears the measured worst case by 90x and the ``sqrt(N_modes)*eps``
#: accumulation bound for the larger plane (4.26e-14) by 23x.  That bound
#: reaches the tolerance near a 4500x4500 plane; a campaign scoring a larger
#: one remeasures.  Any real arithmetic defect -- a wrong band, window, or
#: normalization -- moves a metric by O(1e-3), nine decades clear of this.
CROSS_BOX_TOLERANCE = 1e-12

#: How much of a pure Helmholtz mode the taper moves into the other
#: partition, as a fraction of that mode's energy, when the mode fits
#: ``m`` times across the scored window: ``leakage ~= 0.34 / m**2``.
#:
#: A nonperiodic regional field needs a window, and multiplying by one
#: convolves the mode with the window's own spectrum, so neighbouring modes
#: with a different k direction pick up amplitude and the rotational/
#: divergent projection puts some of the energy on the wrong side.  This is
#: a property of the analysis, not of the wind.
#:
#: MEASURED 2026-08-20 over 38 cases, n=64..256, 2..32 wavelengths across
#: the window, crop 0 and 8: with no crop the fitted coefficient rises from
#: 0.314 at m=2 to 0.340 at m=32, and divergent and rotational leak by the
#: same amount to every digit printed.  0.34 is the asymptote, so the
#: estimate does not under-report at any measured m.  It is meaningful only
#: for m >= 1: a band whose wavelength is longer than the scored window has
#: no partition to trust in the first place.
#:
#: What it costs a campaign: a band at 2 wavelengths across the window
#: carries about 8% leakage, at 6 about 1%, and at 18 about 0.1%.  A
#: divergent-fraction difference smaller than the leakage at that band's
#: scale is the window talking, not the model.
HELMHOLTZ_LEAKAGE_COEFFICIENT = 0.34

#: Metrics that carry the dimensions of band power.  Several of them are
#: analytically zero (the imaginary cross-spectrum of two real fields cancels

#: relative comparison against it is meaningless.  They are compared against
#: the band's reference power instead.

#: Metrics with a fixed range, and that range's magnitude.  Same problem as

#: door on two REAL receipts, where the candidate was a pure rescaling of the

#: out as 2.4e-14 degrees on one box against 2.5e-14 on the other -- a 3.6%
#: relative difference between two numbers that are both zero.  A bounded
#: metric is compared against what it can be, not against what it happens to
#: be: 2.5e-14 of 180 degrees is 1.4e-16, which is the truth.
#:
#: Unbounded ratios are absent on purpose.  ``power_ratio`` and its family
#: can only collapse toward zero when a band's power does, and the variance
