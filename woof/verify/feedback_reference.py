"""Two-way-nesting (feedback) certification against a stock-WRF A/B pair.

Stock WRF emits no parent->child or child->parent coupling field: nest
coupling is an in-memory operation, no ``auxhist`` stream carries it, and
a ``feedback = 1`` run's history file carries the identical variable set
to a ``feedback = 0`` one.  The tendency-field form of a vs-WRF nest
comparison therefore cannot be archived, and this module does not pretend
otherwise -- :func:`build_feedback_ab_tier` carries the tendency form as
an explicit ``not_available`` entry with its evidence.

What stock WRF does permit is an A/B *state* difference: two runs whose
only difference is ``domains.feedback``, so every non-zero difference in
the parent's state is attributable to the feedback operator and nothing
else.  This module scores that difference:

* the pair's layout is read from its own ``provenance.json`` rather than
  from a path convention, and the single-variable guarantee
  (identical inputs, one namelist difference, pristine build) is
  CHECKED -- :func:`load_reference_pair_layout` refuses a pair that does
  not carry it, because a difference measured across two variables is
  not evidence about either one;
* each field is routed to its feedback operator class by the shipped
  operator map's ``op``/``xstag``/``ystag`` triple, never by field name.
  Name routing is the failure this map exists to prevent: the 10 m wind
  diagnostics are carried at mass points and take the cell-average
  operator, while the prognostic winds take the face average, so a
  name-based router assigns two of the most-inspected fields to the
  wrong operator and does so silently;
* the parent region each class is written over is DERIVED from the
  nest geometry and the class's staggering, then checked against the
  zones the pair itself shipped.

Scope.  This module scores the nest-coupling (feedback) tier only.  The
acoustic and gravity-wave conservation receipts are deferred, not
computed here and not computed anywhere in this release; the deferral is
recorded in the receipt itself through
:func:`woof.verify.conservation_closure.deferred_tier` so a reader of a
receipt sees the absence rather than inferring a silent pass.
