# woof/verify/draw_spread.py
"""Realisation spread of receipt statistics across independent draws.

The engine side of the difference-sigma protocol.  Two runs of one case at
two seeds are two draws from one distribution and nothing else; this
aggregates their committed receipts and reports, per metric: n, mean,
sample standard deviation (ddof = 1), min, max, and coefficient of
variation.

**It computes no band, no threshold and no verdict.**  It is arithmetic
over committed numbers.  Bands are cut by the registered method in
``docs/superpowers/receipts/les/P1-MOIST-COMPARISON-EXPECTATION.md`` §4
from the spreads this produces, in a step that cites that document's
registration sha; nothing here can gate anything.

``sd`` is ``None`` for n < 2 rather than 0.0, because one draw has no
spread and reporting one is the same error class as an absent denominator
reading 1.000 -- the failure the dry lane's ``resolved_fraction_ml``
carrier guard exists to prevent.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN A PATCH TO THE ORACLE'S AGGREGATOR
------------------------------------------------------------------------
``tools/wrf_em_les_oracle/moist_spread.py`` aggregates the WRF side and
indexes ``wrfout_sha256`` unconditionally, which no engine receipt has or
should have.  Editing the oracle's instrument so it can also score the
engine it exists to check is precisely what
``tools/wrf_em_les_oracle/INSTRUMENT-HISTORY.md`` forbids, and it would
put both sides' numbers behind one mutable artifact.  So the oracle's file
is untouched and this is a second, independent reduction.

Two independent reductions can drift apart, which would be worse than one
shared one -- so they are pinned together:
``tests/test_les_draw_spread.py`` runs THIS module over the oracle's own
committed multi-draw receipts, with the oracle's own metric and identity
lists, and requires it to reproduce the oracle's published aggregate JSON
exactly.  The equivalence is measured on real committed output, not
asserted from the source.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOTTED PATHS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Metric, identity and flag names are dotted paths into the receipt
(``config.km_opt``, ``saturated_branch.engaged_somewhere``), so one
mechanism covers both sides' receipt shapes: the oracle's are mostly flat
with one nested engagement block, the engine's nest their configuration.
A missing path yields ``None``, which the statistics drop -- an absent
metric reports ``n = 0`` and is never silently counted as a zero.
