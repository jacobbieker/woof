"""Reusable real-weather verification metrics and map primitives.

Phase 5, Task 7 extracts these operations from the frozen
reference-case d01 case.  The arithmetic, operation order, dtypes and masks
are intentionally unchanged.  Case modules provide policy through the
frozen map-spec records below; this module owns only reusable readers,
scorers, diagnostics, and the seam that drives the renderer.

MAP LAYOUT, LABELS AND FILENAMES ARE NO LONGER THIS MODULE'S.  Every
panel here is a weather field, the project render law (
2026-08-06) reserves those for the production Rust renderer
``rw_wrfbatch`` driven through :mod:`woof.rustwx`, and until the
2026-08-18 hidden-scope audit they were drawn with
``matplotlib.pcolormesh``/``contour``/``quiver`` right here, on the bare
default of ``woof verify`` (audit F6).  They come from the renderer
now, filed under the same ``<out>/<domain>/<product>/<valid-day>/``
layout as every other render, and a run with no usable renderer emits
NO weather-field imagery and says so rather than substituting an engine
the law does not allow.
