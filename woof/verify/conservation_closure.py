"""Conservation-closure receipt: schema, three-term budget, atomic writer.

The receipt is the durable form of the mapped column-mass budget the
dycore observers measure.  Three things it deliberately does NOT do:

1. It does not report a single "closure" number.  A forced domain gains
   mass through the lateral-boundary forcing (``rmu_t``) and through the
   specified-zone overwrite as well as through the telescoped lateral
   flux, so the three terms are SEPARATE required keys and the residual
   is what is left after all three.  A flux-only closure on a forced
   domain would be a false receipt, which is why
   :func:`mass_budget_residual` refuses a budget whose forcing terms were
   never supplied rather than defaulting them to zero.
2. It does not decide which residuals are gates.  Every residual is
   carried as a measured value with its own ``tier``; promotion of the
   water and moist-static-energy residuals from observability to gate is
   an owner decision (D-15) and no bound is written here.
3. It does not fabricate the vs-WRF tier.  The nest half of that tier is
   scored from a stock-WRF feedback A/B pair by
   :mod:`woof.verify.feedback_reference`; a receipt built without one
   keeps the schema-reserved shape with null values and a reason rather
   than omitting the tier.

Two absences are recorded as first-class receipt content rather than as
missing keys.  The acoustic and gravity-wave receipts are deferred for
this release and appear as an explicit deferred tier, so a reader sees
the deferral instead of inferring a silent pass.  The guard inventory
enumerates every clamping site the model has, including the ones nothing
counts, each carrying the reason it is uncounted.

Every value in a receipt is measured by the caller.  This module supplies
the shape, the completeness checks, and an atomic ``allow_nan=False``
writer, so a NaN or a missing term fails at write time instead of being
published.
