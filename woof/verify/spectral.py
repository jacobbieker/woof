"""Radially-averaged 2-D power spectra, and the distance between two of them.

The other metric classes ask whether two runs hold the same values in the same
places.  This one asks something the others cannot: whether they hold their
variance at the same *scales*.  Two forecasts can carry equal domain RMSE while
one of them has moved its energy from 10 km features to 2 km noise, and only a
spectrum says so.

Everything a spectrum can be argued about after the fact is pinned here as
data, in :data:`PINS`, and hashed into :data:`PINS_SHA256`: which fields are
scored, how each 3-D field becomes the 2-D plane whose spectrum is taken, the
detrend, the window, the periodogram normalization, the radial bin width and
assignment, which bins are retained, the floor under the logarithm, and the
distance.  The hash is committed against a literal in the test suite, so a pin
edited after a receipt exists changes the hash and fails a test rather than
quietly re-defining what an already-published number measured.

The distance is an integrated log-spectral difference: the integral over the
retained radial band of ``|log10 P_left - log10 P_right|`` in ``dk``, divided
by the width of that band.  It is read in decades.  Logarithms rather than
differences of power because a spectrum spans orders of magnitude across the
band and a linear difference would be a statement about the largest scales
alone; an integral rather than a peak because a spectral defect is usually a
tilt over a range of scales rather than one bad wavenumber.

Three properties this module exists to keep accurate:

* **Zero means identical, and nothing else does.**  The distance between a
  field and itself is exactly ``0.0``, and any bin-wise difference is strictly
  positive.  A distance that could not tell two analytically different spectra
  apart would pass a recovery test and still measure nothing, which is why the
  monotonicity control -- not the recovery test -- is this module's failure
  control.
* **The DC bin is not scored.**  A plane's mean is removed by the detrend
  before the transform, so the zero-wavenumber bin carries only the residue of
  that removal.  Scoring it would report the detrend's rounding as physics.
* **The band stops at the isotropic Nyquist.**  Beyond ``1/(2 dx)`` the
  Fourier grid covers only the corners of k-space, so a radial average there
  is an average over the diagonal directions alone and is not isotropic.

Nothing here is a campaign artifact.  These pins are the general case, taken
by whatever pair of like-configured runs the caller points them at, with the
grid spacing an argument.  The frozen N5S campaign pins in
:mod:`woof.verify.n5s_metrics` are a separate, closed record of one campaign
and are deliberately not parameterized to reach this module: a gate record
that was measured under those pins keeps the numbers it was measured with, and
the general case is carried here.
