"""Float32 CPU reference for WRF v4.6.1 ``CUP_gf`` -- the Grell-Freitas deep
cloud model, ``module_cu_gf_deep.F:39-1868`` plus the 15 procedures it calls.

Stage 1 of the port (``gf_ref.gf_driver_prep``) is GFDRV's column preparation.
This module is stage 2 onward: everything from ``cup_env`` to
``cup_output_ens_3d``, graded stage by stage against
``woof/data/gf/oracle/gf-deep-levels.csv`` and ``gf-deep-surface.csv``, which
``tools/gf_wrf461_oracle/run_gf_stages.F90`` writes out of a replication of
``CUP_gf`` that reproduces the module's own ``cup_gf`` bitwise on all 216
columns.

Only the arm WRF can reach is implemented.  ``module_cu_gf_wrfdrv.F:68-74``
fixes ``imid_gf = 0``, ``ichoice_s = 0``, ``dicycle = 1`` and ``ideep = 1`` as
``parameter``s, and ``module_cu_gf_deep.F`` fixes ``irainevap = 0``,
``autoconv = 1``, ``aeroevap = 1``, ``use_excess = 1`` and ``iversion = 1``
the same way.  The mid-level arm, the Berry autoconversion arm, the aerosol
precipitation-efficiency arm, the SAS rain-evaporation block and the
"real cloud-work function" version of the diurnal closure are therefore dead
code in WRF's GF as shipped, and are named here rather than implemented.
``gfinit`` and ``DERIV3`` are dead too -- ``DERIV3`` completely: nothing in
any of the three GF modules calls it.

Precision
---------
Everything is float32, one rounding per operation, in WRF's association
order.  The cloud model does NOT share the driver's GFS constants: it
declares its own ``g = 9.81``, ``cp = 1004.``, ``xlv = 2.5e6``,
``r_v = 461.`` as plain real(4) parameters, and ``cup_env``/``cup_env_clev``
additionally spell 9.81/1004./2.5e6 as bare literals rather than using the
parameters.  Both constant sets are live in one call; nothing here
harmonises them, and ``tests/test_gf_wrf461_parity.py`` fails if a tidy-up
ever does.

libm, per ``gf-pow-probe.txt`` on the oracle's own toolchain (gfortran
13.3.0, glibc 2.39, -O0):

* ``x**2`` and ``x**3`` with *integer* literal exponents fold bitwise to
  multiply chains on all 24 probes, so ``VSHEAR**2``, ``VSHEAR**3``,
  ``US**2`` and ``(1.-frh)**2`` are spelled as multiplies.  ``kratio**(alpha
  -1.0)`` and ``(1.-kratio)**(beta-1.0)`` are *not*: those exponents are
  runtime values and stay ``powf``.
* ``x**.3333`` is a literal power, not a cube root: ``.3333`` is
  ``0x3EAAA64C`` against ``1./3.``'s ``0x3EAAAAAB``, and they disagree on 10
  of 12 probed x.
* ``expf``, ``logf`` and ``powf`` are modelled as **correctly rounded** --
  float64 with a :mod:`decimal` refinement near the float32 rounding
  boundary, not the float64-round-once surrogate the Shin-Hong port used.
  The surrogate double-rounds, and an 8640-lane fixture finds it: it misses
  ``powf(0x3F0D923B, 0x3E999998)`` by 1 ULP where the 26-form Shin-Hong probe
  never did.

Two things this reference does NOT reproduce bitwise.  Both are measured,
both are glibc rather than WRF, and neither is absorbed into a tolerance.

**``powf`` is not correctly rounded either.**  glibc computes it as a
double-precision ``exp2(y*log2(x))`` with about 0.82 ULP of worst-case error,
so on an argument whose true value sits a whisker from a rounding boundary it
can land on the far side.  The fixture contains exactly one such argument:
``powf(0x3F0D923B, 0x3E999998)``, whose true value to 80 digits is
0.83718320727036911868... against a midpoint of 0.83718320727348327636... --
correctly rounded ``0x3F5651A3``, and it wins by 5.2e-5 of a ULP.  glibc
returns ``0x3F5651A4`` (``ppowhard`` in ``gf-pow-probe.txt``, evaluated
through variables so gfortran cannot fold it).  This port computes the
correctly rounded value, which is the *defined* answer, and the consequence
is bounded: 10 lanes of ``zu`` out of 8640, all on ``ierr == 6`` columns WRF
rejects before they produce a tendency.  Every output field is bitwise.

**``tgammaf`` is not modelled at all, and that one is expensive.**
``get_zu_zd_pdf_fim`` normalises its beta-function mass-flux shape with
``fzu = gamma(alpha+beta)/(gamma(alpha)*gamma(beta))``.  glibc's float32
``tgammaf`` is 1-2 ULP off correctly rounded on 31 of the 51 arguments the
scheme reaches -- ``tgammaf(4.0)`` is ``0x40C00001``, a full ULP above 6 --
and three candidate models were measured against it and all three failed:
``float32(tgamma_float64(x))`` misses 31, ``expf(lgammaf(x))`` misses 39, and
the exp-lgamma-times-product-recurrence shape glibc's own ``e_gammaf_r.c``
uses misses 32 (``plgamma`` in ``gf-pow-probe.txt`` prints the decomposition).
Nothing short of glibc's own algorithm closes it, and WOOF does not
reproduce it.

That gap is NOT a rounding footnote, because **GF amplifies it by five orders
of magnitude**.  Perturb ``fzu`` by one ULP and re-run a converged column and
``xmb`` moves by up to **7.3 per cent** (median 1.9).  ``cup_forcing_ens_3d``
builds every stability closure as ``-xff/xk`` with ``xk = (xaa0-aa1)/mbdt``,
a difference of two cloud work functions that agree to several digits; a
last-bit change in the mass-flux shape walks into the vertical integral
``aa1`` (450 ULP) and the cancellation does the rest.

So :func:`get_zu_zd_pdf_fim` takes an ``fzu`` override.  The parity gate runs
the whole chain twice -- once with :func:`tgammaf` and once with the oracle's
captured ``fzu`` -- and the second run is bitwise on every field, which is
what attributes the residual to ``tgammaf`` alone.  A caller who needs WRF's
answer must supply ``fzu``; a caller who does not gets a per-cent-level
answer and this docstring.

Indexing
--------
Arrays are 1-based to match the Fortran: a per-level array has length
``nz + 1`` and slot 0 is unused.  This is not decoration -- ``cup_kbcon``,
``cup_minimi``, ``get_cloud_bc`` and ``get_zu_zd_pdf_fim`` all do index
arithmetic that is a rich source of off-by-one in a 0-based transcription.

One deliberate divergence, per the project's standing rule that where WRF is
undefined the port implements the defined behaviour and records the gap:
:func:`get_inversion_layers` reads ``t_cup(kend+8)``, and both live call
sites pass ``kend = kstabi``, which ``cup_minimi`` bounds only by ``ktf-1``.
At ``kte = 40`` any column with ``kstabi > 32`` reads off the end of the
array.  This port clamps the loop instead.  The oracle capture clamps the
same way and counts the clamps; the count is 0 on the present fixture, so
the divergence is documented and not exercised.

    ``SH2`` is the shallow scheme's shape and is NOT a re-parameterised
    ``UP``.  Three differences, all live: the tunning clamp is 0.8 rather than
    0.9 and takes ``p(kpbli)`` directly instead of blending it toward
    ``p(kt)`` through ``lev_start``; ``beta`` is 2.5 rather than 1.3; and the

    branch neither raises ``kb_adj`` to 2 nor zeroes ``zu`` below it.  On
    ``SH2`` the base of the profile is therefore left wherever the beta
    function put it, and ``CUP_gf_sh:462-468`` does the zeroing itself.
