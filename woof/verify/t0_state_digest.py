"""Full-state t=0 parity digest over a matched candidate/reference pair.

The published matched-run comparator scores eight surface-and-column
diagnostics per frame.  That is enough to describe a forecast, and it is
not enough to say the initial states agree: a t=0 claim built on it infers
the whole prognostic state from a handful of carriers.  This module scores
the state itself -- every registered carrier group that both frames carry,
on every domain that both directories carry, plus the lateral-boundary
tables when both sides retained them.

Three properties are structural rather than incidental:

* **The ceilings are not this module's to choose.**  ``max``, ``p99`` and
  ``mean signed`` all come from :mod:`woof.verify.nest_gates`, imported by
  name.  Those constants were pinned before any frame scored here existed,
  so a receipt cannot calibrate the gate it is judged by, and this module
  holds no numeric ceiling of its own for anyone to nudge.

* **The ULP is the comparator's.**  Every number in the receipt comes from
  :func:`woof.verify.state_equiv.fp32_signed_ulp`, the one certified
  definition, so the digest and the N2 peer-state gate cannot disagree
  about what a ULP is.

* **Nothing about the case is compiled in.**  Domains, valid times,
  grid spacings and boundary-table names are all discovered from the
  staged directories.  The registration fixes which *variables* belong to
  which carrier group -- physics, not case -- and a two-domain pair scores
  exactly as a four-domain pair does.

The registration is a pre-registration: :func:`make_t0_registration`
returns the whole scoring contract, :func:`registration_sha256` hashes it,
and the receipt embeds both, so a later reader can prove the contract was
not edited to suit the numbers.
