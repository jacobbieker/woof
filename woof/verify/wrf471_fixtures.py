"""Where the compiled WRF v4.7.1 dycore oracle fixtures live.

The advection, small-step and big-step oracle fixtures are test data kept in
a source checkout under ``tests/data`` (``wrf471_advect``,
``wrf471_smallstep``, ``wrf471_bigstep``), beside the diffusion oracle's
``tests/data/wrf471_diffusion``.  They are not package data: under
``woof/data`` they made the 2.8.2 pure wheel 184 MB, over the
100,000,000-byte per-file distribution limit, and no runtime code reads them.

An installed woof therefore carries these harness modules without their
fixtures, and :func:`require_fixture_dir` is the refusal for that case.
