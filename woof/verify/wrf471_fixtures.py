"""Where the compiled WRF v4.7.1 dycore oracle fixtures live.

The advection, small-step and big-step oracle fixtures are test data kept in
a source checkout under ``tests/data`` (``wrf471_advect``,
``wrf471_smallstep``, ``wrf471_bigstep``), beside the diffusion oracle's
``tests/data/wrf471_diffusion``.  They are not package data: under
``woof/data`` they made the 2.8.2 pure wheel 184 MB, over the
100,000,000-byte per-file distribution limit, and no runtime code reads them.

The physics oracle fixtures under ``tests/data/oracles`` (``gf``,
``ntiedtke``, ``urban``, ``uh``, ``noah_mosaic``) followed in 2.8.6 for the
same limit: under ``woof/data`` they were 16.7 MB of compressed wheel, and
the 2.8.6 platform wheels measured 114,055,460 B (manylinux) and
105,828,076 B (win_amd64).  Only the ``woof.verify`` oracle readers and
the tests read them.

An installed woof therefore carries these harness modules without their
fixtures, and :func:`require_fixture_dir` is the refusal for that case.
