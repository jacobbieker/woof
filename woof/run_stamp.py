"""One run, one folder -- the level above the render layout.

The defect this closes was reported by a collaborator running his own
pipeline: he runs the same configuration repeatedly, and every run wrote
into the same directory as the last one.  Renders were the visible half
(a second render drops its PNGs among the first's, and the only way to
tell them apart is a file mtime), but the run artifacts were the
dangerous half -- ``wrfout``, ``report.json``, ``progress.jsonl``, the
stage receipts.  Two runs interleaved in one tree publish receipts that
describe neither, and the create-only refusals that stand in front of
that turn "run it again" into "invent a new directory name, by hand,
every time".

So a run-stamped level is inserted at the CASE ROOT, above everything a
run writes::

    <out>/<run-stamp>/<domain>/<product>/<valid-day>/<file>.png
    <out>/<run-stamp>/run/wrfout/...
    <out>/<run-stamp>/run/report.json
    <out>/<run-stamp>/prepared/, authority/

It EXTENDS WOOF's 2026-08-06 render ruling rather than replacing any
part of it: ``<domain>/<product>/<valid-day>`` survives byte for byte
underneath, in the same order, spelled by the same module
(:mod:`woof.render_layout`).  Nothing here inverts that tree back to
flat and nothing here reorders it.

**The stamp, exactly.**

::

    run-<YYYYMMDD>-<HHMMSS>Z[_i<YYYYMMDD><HHMM>Z][-<NN>]
        \\_______ launch _______/  \\____ init ____/  \\ordinal/

``launch``
    The wall-clock instant the front door was invoked, in UTC.  It leads
    because it is the field that makes two runs of ONE configuration
    different, and putting it first makes a plain directory listing sort
    into run order.  Seconds, not minutes: two back-to-back runs of a
    short configuration land inside the same minute, which is exactly
    the case this exists for.

``init``
    The model's initialisation time -- the cycle a forecast is launched
    from -- in UTC, to the minute.  It is what a forecaster looking at
    two folders actually wants to know, and it is the field that keeps
    two DIFFERENT cycles apart in the listing even when they were
    launched a second apart.

    It is present when the front door holds that fact and ABSENT when it
    does not.  ``woof go`` reads it from the config's ``[fetch] cycle``;
    ``woof sim`` reads it from the prepared bundle's own document;
    ``woof render`` reads ``SIMULATION_START_DATE`` out of the first
    wrfout that carries it.  A door that can read none of those omits
    the component rather than stamping a guess -- a wrong init time in a
    folder name is worse than a missing one, because a reader believes
    it.

``ordinal``
    ``-02``, ``-03`` ... appended ONLY when the directory the first two
    fields name already exists.  Two runs launched inside one second
    would otherwise share a stamp, and the whole point is that they
    cannot share a tree.  The allocation is a create-exclusive
    ``mkdir``, so two processes racing for the same second get different
    folders rather than one folder and a corrupted pair of receipts.

Everything but the ordinal is a pure function of ``(launch, init)``, so
a caller that knows both can compute the folder name before the run
starts -- the same predictability contract the render layout keeps.

**What is NOT stamped.**  The download directory.  ``woof go`` puts it
at ``<out>/data`` and leaves it there across runs on purpose: it holds
INPUTS, it is meant to be reused, and stamping it would re-download
gigabytes of identical GRIB on every re-run.  Artifacts are stamped,
inputs are cached.

**It is the default.**  ``--run-stamp off`` restores the unstamped tree
for a consumer written against it; that is a documented workaround, not
a supported alternative, and each front door says so in ``--help``.

**A path that is already INSIDE a run folder is honoured verbatim.**
Point ``--out``/``--outdir`` at an existing ``run-...`` directory, or at
anything beneath one, and no second stamp level is inserted -- that
path already belongs to a run, and the run owns exactly one folder.
The ancestor half of that is not a nicety: ``woof go`` claims
``<case>/run-.../`` and then hands its render stage
``<case>/run-.../png``, so a render door that asked only "is my own
name a stamp?" allocated a SECOND stamp inside the first, and the two
renders of one run -- the early one on the first committed frame and
the finalize one at the end -- landed in two different ``run-...``
folders minutes apart.  A run folder is the run's identity, never the
calling stage's clock.  What happens next is each door's own business
and each one states it: ``woof go`` and ``woof sim`` REFUSE when the
folder already holds a run, because their stages are create-only and
merging two runs into one tree publishes receipts describing neither;
``woof render`` RESUMES, drawing into the tree that is there, because
rendering more products into an existing run's folder is a workflow and
rendering is idempotent per filename.
