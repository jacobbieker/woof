"""Reaching ``rw_mpas_static``: the static a generated grid needs to run.

A grid file alone reaches no dycore.  It carries a mesh on a unit sphere
with no terrain, no land use and no soil, and the mesh registry that
admits a mesh to a run pins BOTH files by byte count and sha256.  Until
this bridge existed, ``woof mesh`` produced half of a runnable pair and
said so in its own receipt.

The shape is the one every bridge in this package uses: an environment
override, a deterministic candidate list, a two-question probe
(``--version`` separates a runnable executable from a truncated or
wrong-platform file; ``--abi`` catches a build that launches but speaks a
different argument vector), and a runner that streams the engine's
progress grammar.
