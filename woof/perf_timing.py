"""Env-gated wall-clock instrumentation for the un-timed subsystems.

``woof/obs/``, ``woof/verify/`` and ``woof/io/`` carried no wall-clock
timing at all, so every cost attributed to them was reconstructed from
committed counts crossed with a throughput measured somewhere else.  That is
enough to rank a candidate and not enough to start a port.  This module is the
missing instrument, and it is deliberately the cheapest thing that can answer
"which stage, how long, how many bytes".

It is off unless ``WOOF_PERF_TIMING`` is set to something other than an empty
string or ``0``.  While off, :func:`stage` hands back a shared do-nothing
object, so an annotated hot loop pays one module-global read and two method
calls per stage -- tens of nanoseconds against stages that are milliseconds at
their smallest.  Nothing here changes a number the model computes: the
instrument only reads the clock.

Reading the results:

* ``seconds`` is inclusive -- a stage's own work plus everything nested inside
  it.
* ``self_seconds`` subtracts the nested stages, which is what a ranking wants:
  it says where the wall clock actually sat.
* ``counters`` sum whatever the call site passed (``bytes=``, ``gates=``,
  ``sweeps=``), so a rate falls out of the receipt without a second run.

``WOOF_PERF_TIMING_OUT=<path>`` writes the receipt at interpreter exit, which
is how a subprocess stage reports without its parent having to cooperate.
