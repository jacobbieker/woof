"""``render-georef.json``: one record per picture, in the folder the pictures are in.

``rw_wrfbatch`` writes ``<out-dir>/render-georef.json`` and merges each
launch's pictures into what the folder already holds, keyed by the flat
name it drew each picture under.  The caller then does two things the
engine knows nothing about: it launches the engine again (once per grid,
per history file, and while a forecast runs, once per committed frame),
and it moves and renames every picture into
``<domain>/<product>/<valid-day>/``.  So the record the engine leaves
names files that are about to move.

WHAT BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS (gate law): a map that reads the manifest to
place a picture found no entry for any picture of an earlier batch or of
another grid.  The engine drops an entry whose file has left its folder,
and the placement step had just moved every earlier batch's pictures out
of the flat folder, so on the next launch they were all dropped: three
d02 frames rendered through ``woof.render`` delivered 6 pictures and
listed 2.

This module does the caller's half, and the delivered folder's record is
the one it writes.  The pictures of one launch are MOVED while holding
the same ``render-georef.json.lock`` the engine takes (created
exclusively, removed on release), and in that same hold their entries
are re-keyed to where each picture was filed.  No engine launch can merge
in between, so no launch ever sees a flat entry whose picture is
mid-move.  An entry for a picture drawn again replaces the old one, every
other entry is kept while its picture is on disk, and the file is
replaced through a temporary, so a reader never sees half a manifest.

Best effort, like every receipt: a manifest that cannot be merged is
reported on stderr and never fails a render that drew its pictures.
