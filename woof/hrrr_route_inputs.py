"""Author every input file the nested HRRR route needs, from one experiment.

The HRRR domain-tree route takes five documents, and until now the
product emitted exactly one of them.  ``woof domain --source hrrr``
wrote an experiment TOML and a ``namelist.wps`` that was missing
``&share/interval_seconds`` -- the one key that route's own raw-WPS
contract gate demands -- and nothing at all for
``--root-domain-spec``, ``--namelist-input`` or
``--stock-wrf-namelist-input``.  So wizard output could not drive the
route it was sized for, and the gate that proved the route ran at all
had to borrow a separate proof harness to author the missing files.

This module is that authoring, in the product, derived from ONE source
of truth: the :class:`~woof.experiment.ExperimentConfig` the wizard
already emitted.  Every geometry number, every physics switch, every
clock key here is read off that experiment rather than restated, and
:func:`write_hrrr_route_inputs` re-imports what it wrote through the
REAL importer and refuses if the round trip does not reproduce the
experiment it started from.  A set of files that disagrees with the
TOML beside them is exactly the failure this replaces; it cannot be
written and then discovered three stages downstream.

What the route requires of these files is not restated here as prose --
it is enforced by the gates in :mod:`woof.hrrr_hierarchy_direct`,
which the tests run over these exact bytes.

#: forecast cannot be written into the files that route runs from.  A

    """Every file a candidate configuration must carry beside it.

    ONE answer for every door that publishes a configuration -- the
    domain editor, the forcing editor, the schedule editor, the
    saved-setup start, ``woof domain-fit``, ``woof domain-tiles`` and
    the following-nest authoring door -- because the question belongs to
    the ROUTE that configuration will run on, not to the edit, the refit
    or the authoring that produced it.  Answered per door it was
    answered wrong: the domain editor wrote the configuration and its
    WPS namelist and nothing else, so EVERY edit it made to a
    native-route configuration -- any action, any grid -- produced a
    candidate without the namelists the route runs from.  The fit and
    tile doors published the same short set for the same reason.  A run
    of an incomplete set no longer stops for it
    (:func:`run_route_inputs` writes the set into the run folder), but
    the set a door writes is still the one a user sees and edits beside
    the configuration, and a complete set is the one the route reads.

    ``source`` is the candidate's own ``[fetch].source`` -- the very key
    the dispatcher reads to choose the chain -- or ``None`` when it has
    none.  Not "``None`` when the configuration carries ``[case_data]``":
    a configuration with both would then be given a short copy and still
    routed to the regional chain.  The chain is resolved through
    :func:`woof.source_drivability.candidate_route_chain`, which is
    where that one branch lives so that a preprocessing install carrying
    this module without the forecast dispatcher can still ask it;
    :mod:`woof.runplan` keeps the name as a re-export, so a reader of
    the dispatcher still finds it.  One branch, so the set of files
    written here and the set the run reads cannot be decided
    differently.

    Returns ``[(destination, text), ...]`` with the WPS namelist first.
    Text rather than written files, because every one of these doors
    publishes its whole set through one create-only helper that owns
    rollback, and a file written here would sit outside it.  The route's
    own writer still runs, into a staging directory, so what comes back
    has been through :func:`verify_round_trip` against the real importer
    -- the nest cadence an edit just set is read back out of the bytes
    that carry it rather than assumed into them.
