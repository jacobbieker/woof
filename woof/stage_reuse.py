"""Whether a chain stage's existing output can be reused, and why.

A run plan that failed at a late stage leaves every earlier stage's
output on disk, verified.  Re-running the same plan into the same
``output_root`` is the cheapest recovery there is -- the forcing is
already fetched and hash-verified, and the prepared bundle beside it
either still describes this run or does not.  Nothing here decides
that by looking at a model's name: the decision is read off artifacts
a stage published, in the vocabulary those artifacts already use, so a
source added to the fetch tables gets the same behaviour with no code
here to edit.

Three rules, and they are different rules for a reason.

**Fetch reuses by itself.**  ``woof fetch`` already verifies an
existing payload's request identity, envelope, record count and
recorded digest before skipping it, and refuses a directory it cannot
tie to this request.  Nothing in this module touches that; the chain
only has to relay what the fetch receipt says it did.

**Preparation reuses when its identity still holds.**  The question is
"would this run hand the preparer the same instructions, over the same
input bytes, from the same engine?", and all three halves are answered
from artifacts:

* the published prepared-cache identity
  (:func:`woof.ingest.prepared_cache.prepared_cache_identity`) carries
  the source-manifest digest, the namelist digest and the DATA-source
  identity of the bundle -- adapter, input-manifest digest, decoder
  digest -- and that identity is the very thing the forecast runner
  re-derives and compares before it will read a cache at all, so asking
  it before spending the preparation asks exactly the right question.
  What no adapter writes into it is the identity of the CODE, which is
  why the engine is recorded beside the bundle by :func:`write_binding`
  rather than read out of a block that never carried it;
* the binding receipt this module writes beside a finished preparation
  records the preparer's own arguments with every path-valued one
  reduced to the digest of the file it named, so a changed cycle, run
  length, cadence, physics profile, domain spec or namelist all move it
  and a relocated run directory does not.

The source identity pins the engine's own git state, so an engine that
has advanced invalidates every bundle it prepared.  That is not a
defect and it is not expensive -- a rebuild costs the same tens of
seconds the first preparation cost, against a fetch measured in
minutes and gigabytes.  It is also the only answer that stays true:
reusing a bundle across an engine change would hand the forecast a
cache the runner would then refuse, turning a cheap rebuild into a
confusing late refusal.

**A forecast's output directory is not reused by a NEW run.**  Its
receipt has to describe one run -- ``claim_output_directory`` in the
prepared runners says so. A previous attempt's output stays at its
original address; the retry receives a separate generation for its
forecast and pictures, preserving every earlier receipt's frame paths.

**A RESUME owns a new output generation inside the previous run.**
An older checkpoint can replay times already published by the previous
attempt. :func:`claim_run_output` gives that resumed attempt a fresh
``segment-NNN`` directory, leaving the earlier frames, input records and
receipts together and unchanged. The checkpoint continues to refer to
its original location. A run with no checkpoint uses the shared claim's
existing rule for new output.

Nothing here ever deletes.  Superseded output is renamed beside
itself, the same contract ``woof fetch --force-refetch`` offers for a
data directory, and the byte count is reported so a caller can say what
reclaiming it would return.
