"""Typed multi-domain experiment schema and TOML loader (Phase 5, lane L1).

Implements section A of the RATIFIED Phase-5 nesting architecture
(docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-phase5-nesting-architecture.md): frozen
:class:`DomainConfig`/:class:`ExperimentConfig` dataclasses over the
existing :class:`woof.config.RunConfig`, the ``[experiment]`` /
``[shared]`` / ``[[domain]]`` / ``[projection]`` TOML shape, and every
load-time validation rule of the ratified design -- all fail-loud.

Clock fields (architecture section C): the ROOT domain carries WRF's
exact integer-rational model step -- ``time_step`` (integer seconds) plus
the optional ``time_step_fract_num``/``time_step_fract_den`` correction,
mirroring WRF v4.6.1 Registry.EM_COMMON:2245-2246::

    rconfig   integer time_step           namelist,domains  1   -1  ih ...
    rconfig   integer time_step_fract_num namelist,domains  1    0  ih ...
    rconfig   integer time_step_fract_den namelist,domains  1    1  ih ...

Child ``dt`` and ``dx`` are NEVER hand-typed: ``dt_child = dt_parent /
parent_time_step_ratio`` and ``dx_child = dx_parent / parent_grid_ratio``
as exact rationals -- WRF divides the parent's rational time interval by
``parent_time_step_ratio`` EXACTLY (share/set_timekeeping.F:366-368,
``stepTime = domain_get_time_step(parents(1)) / parent_time_step_ratio``).
Explicitly supplied child values are cross-checked and a mismatch is a
hard error: the namelist chain is authoritative (the bundle's d04 runs at
exactly 1000/3 m and 5/3 s -- never a hand-typed "500 m", never 1.6667).

The legacy single-domain path is untouched: ``load_config()`` and the
``[grid]``/``[dynamics]``/``[run]`` tables resolve byte-identically
(pinned by tests/test_config_freeze.py); frozen verify cases construct
``RunConfig`` directly and never migrate.

#: Per-domain RunConfig scalars a [[domain]] table may override

#: namelist, radt 12/3/1/1, bldt, epssm's Registry-default tail, and
#: diff_6th_factor 0.12/0.10/0.08/0.06).  The turbulence row (km_opt
#: through tke_drag_coefficient) is the per-domain closure selection the
#: design doc reserved ("turbulence treatment stays configurable per
#: domain"): a PBL parent may carry a PBL-off Smagorinsky child.  Every
#: per-domain RunConfig still passes the full validate_run_config battery,
#: so cross-key refusals (PBL requires a surface layer, km_opt=3/4
#: excludes khdif/kvdif, isfflx=0/2 need their consumer) apply per domain
#: with the same messages as a single-domain config.  Per-domain LES
#: selection is a configuration capability, implemented-unverified for
#: nested LES children: no evidence covers a nested, specified-boundary,
#: moist, or terrain-following LES domain.
#: One entry here is a woof capability WRF cannot express, and it is
#: called out rather than left to be rediscovered: ``isfflx`` is
#: ``nentries=1`` in WRF (Registry.EM_COMMON:2644) -- a SCALAR namelist
#: rconfig, where ``km_opt`` (:2993) and ``bl_pbl_physics`` (:2617) are
#: ``max_domains`` columns.  ``isfflx = 1, 1, 0`` is therefore not a WRF
#: namelist at all: a Fortran namelist read of a list into a scalar is an
#: error, not a per-domain selection.  Admitting it per domain HERE is a
#: deliberate gpuwm-over-WRF extension of the TOML schema, and it is
#: reachable only by writing the TOML directly -- ``woof.namelist_import``
#: reads ``isfflx`` as the scalar WRF spells (commit a0ef9d29 reverted the
#: column reader for inventing a spelling WRF does not have), and
#: ``hrrr_hierarchy_direct``'s certified raw runtime contract pins
#: ``("physics", "isfflx")`` to the scalar ``[1]`` and refuses a column.
#: So no namelist-driven route can produce a per-domain isfflx, and none
#: should: a config that uses it has left WRF-expressible territory and
#: cannot be round-tripped back to a namelist.

    ``vertical``/``projection`` are the F1-amendment value objects:
    frozen/hashable, serialized verbatim in the resolved-TOML round trip,
    and inside the section-B experiment fingerprint -- two experiments
    differing in any eta level or projection parameter compare (and
    hash) distinct.  ``projection`` is required for real TOMLs (shared
    ``map_proj`` nonzero, WRF convention 1=lambert/2=polar/3=mercator);
    ``None`` is reserved for wrapped idealized configs
    (:func:`experiment_from_run_config`).

    TIMING AUTHORITY (F14 amendment): ``run_seconds`` /
    ``restart_interval_s`` here and each domain's ``history_interval_s``
    are the ONLY authoritative timing values; the embedded per-domain
    RunConfig copies are derived and asserted equal at load.

    ``blend_width`` defaults to 5 per Registry.EM_COMMON:2324 (``rconfig
    integer blend_width ... 5 "width of cg fg terrain blended zone"``).
    ``feedback`` is a tree-wide switch: 0 is the production one-way path
    and 1 enables the experimental child-to-parent restriction path.
    ``smooth_option`` selects WRF's post-feedback parent smoother
    (interp_fcn.F:3794-4014): 0 none, 1 ``sm121``, 2 ``smdsm`` (WRF's
    Registry default).  It is read only when feedback = 1, exactly as

    """A track stream that cannot produce accurate records refuses AT LOAD.

    Two ways to configure one that cannot, each refused by name here
    rather than discovered as an empty file after a twelve-hour run:

    **An interval that can never fire.**  The runner only acts at
    complete cycle boundaries, so an interval that is not a whole number
    of root steps rounds to whichever boundary happens to follow it.
    Same contract ``cadence_seconds`` holds, same refusal.

    **A finer interval on a stash-backed field THE ROW READS.**  ``uh``
    and ``reflectivity`` are not reduced on demand: they are planes
    somebody else folded into a scratch slot on somebody else's rhythm,
    and asking for one between those instants gets an answer that does
    not mean what the tracker's answer means.

    That argument only bites if the row is derived from the plane, and
    for those two fields it no longer is: a rotation or echo tracker
    writes POSITION ONLY -- the mover's own centre, off the mover's own
    grid, exact at every cycle boundary -- so the runner skips locating
    on a track-only boundary and there is nothing stale to read.  The
    refusal is kept, expressed as the fields that are stash-backed AND
    not position-only, so it comes back on its own if either set ever
    changes; today that difference is empty.

    ``refl_10cm`` is stashed by the microphysics inside its
    ``refl_10cm_due`` branch, which follows the HISTORY cadence -- so a
    track emission off that cadence reads a plane from some earlier
    instant, or none at all, and issue #111's refusal
    (:func:`_refuse_unservable_follow_cadence`) is the same contract one
    step further out.  The UH follow window is reset once per relocation
    cadence by the runner, so a read between resets sees a PARTIAL
    accumulation: the track row would report a centre derived from two
    minutes of rotation while the nest was steered by six, and the file
    would disagree with the model it claims to describe.  "Two formats,
    one fix" is the whole design, and a partial window breaks it.

    Note what this refusal is NOT: reading a stash does not perturb the
    forecast.  The reset belongs to the mover's consultation and stays
    there, so a track stream cannot move the nest however often it
    looks.  This is about the accuracy of the record, not its safety.

    A ``pressure`` tracker reduces from the live prognostic column, which
    is valid at every cycle boundary, so it is exempt -- the same line
    :data:`woof.core.storm_tracking.STASH_BACKED_FIELDS` already draws
    for the follow cadence.

    THE 10-M WIND REFUSAL IS SCOPED THE SAME WAY, and for the same
    reason: it exists because ``vmax`` would be written as a plausible
    0.00 m/s under ``sf_sfclay_physics = 0``, and a position-only row has
    no ``vmax`` column to be wrong about.  Note this is a refusal on
    :data:`woof.core.storm_tracking.STASH_BACKED_FIELDS`' cousin
    question, not on the tracker itself:
    :func:`_refuse_unservable_follow_cadence` still applies in full,
    because the NEST is steered by the plane whatever the file says.

    The tracker's composite-reflectivity plane is not a diagnostic it can
    ask for on demand: ``refl_10cm`` is stashed by the microphysics
    drivers inside their ``refl_10cm_due`` branch, which follows the
    HISTORY cadence.  So an evaluation cadence that is not a whole
    multiple of the watched domain's ``history_interval_s`` asks for a
    plane at instants where it does not exist, and the run discovers
    that mid-flight as a ``TrackerRefusal`` -- at the first cadence where
    UH is under threshold and the echo fallback is consulted, which may
    be hours in and is exactly the moment a storm-following nest is
    supposed to be working.

    This is issue #111, and the contract is not new: the shipped
    ``moving_nest_20110427_follow_2km.toml`` states it in a comment above
    ``cadence_seconds`` and nothing enforced it.  Refused here, at
    admission, naming both knobs and the multiple that would work.

    It applies to ``field = "uh"`` as much as to ``field =
    "reflectivity"``: the echo handoff is automatic, not opt-in, so a
    UH-primary tracker whose cadence the stash cannot serve is a run that
    refuses the first time rotation is absent.

    ``table`` and ``follow_table`` name the tables the knobs actually
    live in, because this refusal serves two shapes of configuration: a
    whole-run ``[relocation]`` and a per-domain ``[[domain]].follow``.
    Naming the wrong one sends the reader to a table their configuration
    does not have, and since the per-domain followers are refused at load
    this is the message most readers meet.

    The watched domain is the PARENT of ``grid_id``.  ``grid_id`` names
    the child that MOVES; ``RelocationRunner`` hands the provider
    ``node.parent.state``, so the stash whose cadence matters belongs to
    the parent.

    This is the only place both halves of the question are known -- the
    shared vertical coordinate owns the layer depths, each domain owns
    its horizontal spacing and its mixing selectors -- so it is where the
    layer depths meet the selectors.  It computes no verdict: callers
    hand the result to :func:`woof.config.anisotropic_w_mixing_advice`,
    which owns the criterion and the wording.

    A COORDINATE WITH NO EXPLICIT ETA INTERFACES IS RESOLVED, NOT
    SKIPPED.  Skipping it was a hole: ``km_opt = 3`` with
    ``mix_isotropic = 0`` at ``dx = 100`` m and no ``eta_levels`` is the
    exact configuration the criterion exists for, and until 2026-08-09 it
    came back empty and every door went quiet -- silence read as a pass
    by anything downstream, which is the opposite of what the absence of
    a number means.  When the ladder is not written down it is rebuilt
    the way the model rebuilds it: the uniform interfaces
    :func:`woof.core.grid.make_vertical_coord` produces from ``nz``
    (every idealized/legacy route in the tree calls it with no
    ``stretch``), with the model top expressed as a pressure by
    :func:`woof.core.grid.analytic_base_pressure`, whose base state is
    the one :func:`~woof.core.grid.base_layer_depths` already inverts --
    so the resolved column spans exactly ``[0, ztop]``.

    ``nz``/``ztop`` come off the first domain because they cannot differ
    across domains: they are in ``_DOMAIN_VERTICAL_KEYS``, so a
    per-domain spelling is a load error and the vertical grid is shared
    by construction.

    ``dz_max = inf`` when even that fails (a model top above the analytic
    base state's ~24.6 km ceiling).  Infinity is a SENTINEL, not a large
    depth: no ratio is computed from it -- ``anisotropic_w_mixing_ratio``
    returns ``None`` for a non-finite depth, because there is no number
    and inventing one would put a fictitious depth into a stability
    criterion.  What it does instead is select a different sentence:
    :func:`woof.config.anisotropic_w_mixing_advice` recognises the
    non-finite depth on an otherwise-exposed domain and advises that the
    criterion CANNOT BE EVALUATED here, quoting ``ladder`` for the reason.
    That advisory reaches the same three doors the numeric one does --
    the load-time warning, ``woof check``, and the repository screen in
    ``tests/test_shipped_configs_mixing_stability.py``, which reports the
    domain with an infinite ratio exactly as its legacy branch does.

    Until 2026-08-09 that sentinel went nowhere: the ``None`` it produced
    was the same ``None`` a config OFF the exposed path produces, so all
    three doors read it as "not applicable" and went quiet.  Anything
    here that consumes the ratio alone must not read its absence as a
    pass -- ask for the advice.
