"""The speedrun: one named course, run end to end, sealed into one capsule.

THE CLOCK STARTS WHEN THE BYTES ARE STAGED.  Fetching is not part of a
run -- nobody benchmarks their ISP -- so a course names the staged inputs
it consumes by digest and the measured thing is staged-inputs to
finished-products: preparation, forecast, render.

Everything here exists because a benchmark that can be gamed is not an
instrument.  Four specific ways a weather-model time can lie, and the
answer this module gives to each:

**Comparing runs of different work.**  A record is comparable to another
record only when the course id, the resolved course row, the product set
and the compile mode all match.  Those four are hashed into one
``comparability.key``, the key is inside the sealed body, and every
comparison door in this module calls :func:`assert_comparable` first.
Editing a capsule to force a match breaks the seal, so the two halves
close each other: an accurate capsule refuses the comparison by name, and a
doctored one refuses to be read at all.  That is the difference between
discouraging an incomparable comparison and preventing it.

**A fast run that did no work.**  A NaN-filled sprint to a blank PNG is
the fastest possible forecast.  :func:`evidence_verdict` demands positive
evidence instead of absence of error: frames actually written, every
product the course declares actually rendered, every product file
non-empty with a real digest, and the run's own forecast-validity verdict
PASS.  A record that cannot show all four is VOID and cannot be compared.

**The invisible minute.**  The first GPU run on a machine pays roughly a
minute of NVRTC kernel compilation (see
:mod:`woof.kernel_compile_notice`).  Including it silently makes a warm
box look fast; excluding it silently makes the number a user will never
see.  So: the compile is ALWAYS inside the clock, the capsule says so in
``compile.included_in_clock``, the seconds are broken out as their own
named stage from the run's own ``progress.jsonl``, and ``compile.mode``
is part of the comparability key -- a cold record and a warm record are
different records and this module will not compare them.  The door
measures the cache state before the clock starts and refuses a mismatch
against what the course declared.

**A determinism claim nobody screened.**  These cards have no ECC, so
"deterministic" is a measurement, not a property.  A capsule's
``determinism`` block starts at ``not_screened`` with a ``null`` claim,
and only :func:`determinism_screen` -- given the second arm of a real
dual run -- may set it.  A capsule that claims determinism without the
screen is VOID.

Courses are TABLE DATA (``woof/speedrun_courses.json`` plus assets under
``configs/speedrun/``).  Adding one is a row and two files; there is no
per-course code path here and the test suite fails if one appears.
