"""Run a standalone CUDA child from archived woof/WRF parent history.

This is woof's native offline-nest driver.  It consumes ordinary parent
history plus authoritative source-physics evidence, performs SINT cold-start

advances only the requested child on the GPU.  It never invokes WPS,

    """The capsule a reader is handed when a child stops being finite.

    WHAT BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS (gate law).  "offline child became
    non-finite at step 6624" was the whole of what a blown-up child said,
    and it is the one sentence that sends a reader back to re-run the
    thing to learn anything at all: it names no field, no place in the
    grid, no model time, and none of the trend the health record was
    already holding.  On the run this was built from, that record held
    six checks of w_max climbing 10.73, 13.22, 15.77, 18.12, 21.05,
    22.97 m/s over the five minutes before the end, with the CFL never
    leaving the 0.19-0.21 band -- a reading that says plainly the time
    step was not what ran out -- and every one of those numbers was
    dropped at the moment it mattered.

    WHAT THE SENTENCE CLAIMS, and no more.  The fields found non-finite
    at the health check after step N, the box they fall inside with its
    cell count, and whether that box touches a lateral edge.  It used to
    name "the cell W went non-finite at", which was the lowest
    memory-order index of the whole non-finite set: always that set's
    lowest level and southmost row, so a block that had spread down to
    the ground read as a blow-up at k=0 on its south edge, and W, which
    is simply first in the survey's list, read as the field that failed
    first.  A single cell is named only when the set is one cell.  The
    last measured |w| maximum's place, which the trend rows carry, is
    the nearest thing to an origin the record holds, and the message
    says it as that.

    Returns the capsule as a document: ``summary`` is the one sentence
    the run-plan ``failed`` event carries and a run view shows first,
    ``message`` is the whole refusal, and the rest are the same facts as
    fields, so the sentence and ``report.json`` cannot disagree.

    THE CARRYING SHAPE, which this document is written under and which
    :func:`child_health_log_fields` produces: every ``trend`` row holds
    ``w_max`` and ``cfl`` as a number or ``null``, with ``w_max_state``
    and ``cfl_state`` beside them spelling ``"measured"``,
    ``"non-finite"`` or ``"not computed"``.  A row handed in any other
    shape is normalised to it here (:func:`_health_row`), so no reading
    this capsule carries can reach a serializer as a non-finite float --
    which is what lets ``report.json`` and the ``child_step`` line be
    written with ``allow_nan=False``, the receipt convention of the rest
    of this tree, on precisely the outcome whose readings went.

    exit 2, with the command that draws the finished frames by hand, and
    a ``products`` block in the report so the two documents agree.
