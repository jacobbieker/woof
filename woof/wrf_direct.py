"""Direct woof prepared-cache -> WRF ``wrfinput``/``wrfbdy`` export.

This module is intentionally independent of WPS and WRF executables.  It
consumes the launch-ready native woof preparation cache, the matching native
static cache, and a small geometry receipt.  A frozen WRF-v4.6.1 declaration
contract supplies only NetCDF metadata; all gridded state is derived from the
native inputs.

Who writes the bytes: WOOF's Rust.  The DEFAULT engine is the classic
writer at ``tools/rustwx/crates/netcdf-writer``, driven through
:mod:`woof.io.nc_writer_bridge` and the shared
:class:`woof.io.classic_tape.ClassicTape` facade -- the same seam the
wrfout history tape writes through.  The export's closing verification
runs there too: the ``rw_netcdf`` reader for the header (attributes,
inventory, dimensions) and the writer crate's own read-back sweep for
the finiteness check over every float variable.  ``netCDF4`` survives in
this module for exactly one thing, the ``WOOF_WRFINPUT_WRITER=python``
workaround engine, which is announced as a workaround and never selected
silently.

The supported slice is a single specified projected domain
(lambert/mercator/polar; MAP_PROJ and MAP_PROJ_CHAR derive from the
geometry receipt) with an explicit validated hybrid eta coordinate and a
registry-resolved fixed physics profile.  Stock-WRF acceptance is proven for
Lambert; mercator/polar exports are oracle-gated but not yet stock-WRF-gated.
Unsupported cache/configuration combinations fail closed.
