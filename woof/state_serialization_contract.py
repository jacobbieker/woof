#: It lives HERE rather than beside the restart reader because both sides
#: of the tolerance need it and only one of them is a forecast module:
#: ``woof.io.restart`` REFUSES a mid-trajectory GF checkpoint that lacks
#: the pair, and ``woof.ingest.prepared_cache`` TOLERATES a prepared
#: cache that lacks it -- a cache is the t=0 state, where the pair is
#: identically zero.  prepared_cache is preprocessing and ships in the
#: standalone RW-WPS wheel, which stages no restart reader at all, so
#: reading the table out of ``woof.io.restart`` put a staged module in
#: that wheel reaching for a deliberately absent one and
#: ``tools/build_rw_wps_release.py`` refused to stage.  A name table is
#: data; this module is where this package's serialization data lives.
ADVECTIVE_FORCING_STATE = ("rthften", "rqvften")

#: Arrays a CHECKPOINT must carry that are NOT part of the state
#: identity.  The distinction is the whole point of this tuple.
#:
#: ``STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS`` is not merely "what a checkpoint holds": it
#: is what :func:`woof.ensemble.state_sha.live_state_sha256` hashes, and
#: therefore what ``relocate_child`` compares to assert a parent is never
#: written across a move, and what the ensemble and streaming digests
#: attest.  Anything in there is a claim about the domain's physical
#: state.
#:
#: ``ww_pp`` -- the acoustic perturbation eta mass flux Omega'' -- has to
#: survive a restart. ``small_step_init`` does not seed it, and
#: ``advance_mu_th`` leaves the forced outer column untouched before WRF
#: ``sumflux`` reads it. It therefore owns per-domain storage, even in a
#: tree with a shared dycore workspace. Sharing it formerly let child
#: work overwrite the parent's retained boundary flux and checkpoint.
#:
#: The existing ``acoustic/`` namespace and exclusion from physical-state
#: digests are preserved for checkpoint and relocation identity compatibility.
#: This is independent of allocation ownership: the field is now retained by
#: the domain, never admitted to the step-local rebuilt workspace.
