"""``woof fetch-tables``: stage externalized physics table assets.

Most packaged lookup tables ship inside the wheel and the repository.
The exceptions are the *externalized* assets named here: files whose
size exceeds distribution-channel limits, published as versioned GitHub
release assets and staged into the resolved table root on demand.
Currently that is the two largest classic Thompson coefficient tables:

- ``freezeH2O.dat`` (243 MiB): over GitHub's 100 MiB blob limit, so it
  is absent from both the repository and the wheel/sdist -- every
  install fetches it once.
- ``qr_acr_qg_V4.dat`` (71 MiB): fits in the repository (git-clone
  installs already have it; fetch-tables verifies and moves on) but
  would push the wheel and sdist over PyPI's 100 MB per-file cap, so
  wheel installs fetch it.

The staging contract is the model's own: every byte that lands in the
table root is verified against the exact size and SHA-256 pins in
:data:`woof.core.thompson_contract.CLASSIC_TABLE_ASSETS` -- the same
pins every ``mp_physics=8`` run enforces at load -- *before* the file is
atomically moved into place.  A mismatched download is deleted and
refused, never installed; an existing file with wrong bytes is refused,
never overwritten (delete it yourself and re-run).  The command is
idempotent: with all assets present and byte-valid it verifies and
exits 0 without touching the network.

``--from DIR`` stages from a local directory (offline/air-gapped
installs) under the same verification.  ``WOOF_TABLE_ASSET_URL_BASE``
overrides the download base URL (mirrors); the asset filename is
appended to it either way.

``--wif`` adds ONE more externalized asset to the same transaction: the
225 MB ``QNWFA_QNIFA_SIGMA_MONTHLY.dat`` global monthly aerosol
climatology the mp=28 WIF ingest reads
(:mod:`woof.ingest.wif_dataset` holds its pin and its acquisition
route).  It is opt-in rather than default because it is an INPUT
DATASET, not a coefficient table: no scheme selection makes it
mandatory, only ``aer_init_opt=1`` with ``wif_input_opt=1`` does, and a
default install must not be asked for a quarter-gigabyte it will never
open.  It stages into ``~/.woof/wif`` -- its own root, because a table
root is validated as a complete set and a WPS intermediate file inside
one would make "complete" unanswerable -- under the identical
verify-then-atomically-install contract, since the reason both files
are externalized is one reason: the release checklist's size gates.

WHERE the bytes land moved once, deliberately.  This command used to
stage into whatever ``thompson_table_root()`` resolved to, which on a
wheel install is *inside site-packages* -- so the 315 MiB a user had
just paid for was deleted by the next ``pip install --upgrade`` or venv
rebuild, silently, and the failure surfaced as a bare
``FileNotFoundError`` traceback in the middle of a forecast that had
already paid for fetch and preprocessing.  Staging now targets
``~/.woof/tables/thompson`` (:func:`woof.physics_compat
.user_thompson_table_root`), beside ``~/.woof/bridges``, and the
staged root is made *complete*: the assets that do ship in the package
are copied in beside the downloaded ones, because a root is validated
as a whole set and a half-staged directory would resolve to nothing.
An install whose packaged root is already complete -- every git clone,
and every wheel that staged into site-packages before this change --
is left exactly where it is.
