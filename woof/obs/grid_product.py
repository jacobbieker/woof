"""Which library writes the gridded observation products.

``gpuwm-obs.radar-grid.v1`` and ``gpuwm-obs.goes-grid.v1`` are the two files
the DA lanes read and nothing upstream of them.  Both are written here, and
both are written by the SAME engine decision, because a cycle whose radar
product is classic and whose satellite product is HDF5 -- because the
environment moved between two calls of one door -- is a file set nobody
declared.

``rust`` is the DEFAULT and needs no flag: the schema goes through
:class:`woof.io.classic_product.ClassicProduct` onto the dependency-free
classic writer at ``tools/rustwx/crates/netcdf-writer``.  ``python`` reaches
the netCDF4/HDF5 writer these products used through 2.4, and is an ANNOUNCED
WORKAROUND: it is selected only by naming :data:`OBS_GRID_WRITER_ENV`, never
on its own and never as a fallback.

The read halves are unaffected and were already Rust: both products decode
their observation arrays through :mod:`woof.netcdf_bridge`.
