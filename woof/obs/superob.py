"""Gate-to-cell superobbing: many range gates in, one observation per cell out.

Two moments, two very different reductions, for physical reasons rather
than stylistic ones.

**Reflectivity** is averaged in *linear* Z and reported back in dBZ, because
dBZ is a logarithm and the mean of logarithms is not the logarithm of the
mean: averaging dBZ directly biases a cell containing one strong core and
several weak gates low by many dB.  The in-cell maximum is carried beside
the mean because convective assimilation usually wants the core, and a
consumer that has to reconstruct one from the other cannot.

**Radial velocity** is averaged per contributing radar and never across
radars: two radars looking at the same cell measure different projections of
the same wind, and their mean is a number with no observation operator.  The
beam unit vector is averaged with the velocities and renormalized, so every
retained velocity ships the look direction that turns it into an
observation.

**Clear air is an observation, and it is built from measurements only.**
A cell is reported clear when enough gates were *measured* inside it and
all of them came back below the significant-echo floor, and no radar saw
echo there.  The gates that support that claim are finite decoded values;
a missing gate never contributes.

Which gates can support that claim depends on what the pack it came from
was able to tell us, and there are two regimes.

**The measurement-only regime** (:data:`CLEAR_AIR_SOURCE`, the default).
A ``gpuwm-obs.radar-sweeps.v1`` pack carries one plane per moment, in which
every unusable gate is the same NaN.  Three quite different things produce
that NaN: raw gate code 0 (*below threshold* -- the radar looked and
detected nothing, which is precisely the clear-air observation), raw code 1
(*range folded* -- an ambiguous second-trip return that may be a storm),
and a radial that never carried the moment at all.  Downstream they are
indistinguishable, so NaN cannot be evidence of clear air without
fabricating observations wholesale: on a real KDMX volume that is about
9.7 million ambiguous gates against 1.1e4 unambiguous ones.  This regime
therefore uses only the unambiguous remainder -- gates that decoded to a
real number below ``min_reflectivity_dbz`` -- and accepts a thin product.

**The censored regime** (:data:`CLEAR_AIR_SOURCE_CENSOR`), available when
the pack is a ``gpuwm-obs.radar-sweeps.v2`` written by
``rw_nexrad decode --censor-flags``.  There the decoder's own reason for
each NaN rides beside it as a :class:`~woof.obs.sweeps.Censor` code, so
"below threshold" is separable from "range folded" and from "never
collected", and the first of those becomes what it always was in the
signal: a measurement of nothing.  Pass ``clear_air_from_censor=True`` to
:func:`superob_volume` to use it.

**The ODIM regime** (:data:`CLEAR_AIR_SOURCE_ODIM`), the same flag over a
``gpuwm-obs.radar-sweeps.v3`` pack written by ``rw_odim pack``.  ODIM
reserves ``undetect`` for "looked, found nothing" and it arrives as the same
code 1, so the admission test does not change; what changes is the *name*
written into the product, because the claim behind it was made by a European
national processor and not by an RDA, and a consumer reading
``clear_air_source`` is entitled to know which.  ODIM also mints two states
NEXRAD has no word for, and the regime's substance is that neither is
admitted: ``NODATA`` is the radar reporting it did not look, and
``SENTINEL_AMBIGUOUS`` is a file that gave both sentinels the same raw value
so the gate may be either.  Both are counted and refused.

**Range-folded gates are never clear air, in either regime.**  Raw code 1
means the radar cannot say which trip the return came from, and the answer
may be a storm.  It is admitted by no configuration of this module: the
censored regime tests for equality with one code
(:data:`~woof.obs.sweeps.Censor.BELOW_THRESHOLD`) rather than for
"non-echo", and the measurement-only regime never sees a non-finite gate at
all.  ``clear_air_source`` in the written file records which regime
produced the zeroes, so a consumer always knows which coverage and which
error model it is holding.

**Aliasing is masked by default, and corrected on request.**  With
``SuperobParams.dealias`` left at its default ``None`` nothing in this
module has changed: the four fail-closed masks below are the whole of the
alias defense, no velocity is ever modified, and the observation files this
stage produces are byte-for-byte the ones it has always produced.  Setting
that field to a :class:`woof.obs.dealias.DealiasParams` turns on
region-based unfolding -- see :mod:`woof.obs.dealias` for the algorithm and
its abstention rule -- which runs per sweep *before* everything below, so
the masks then see velocities whose fold state is known rather than
suspected.  Two things change when it is on and nothing else does:

* a gate the unfolder could not resolve is dropped and counted, whatever its
  magnitude, because "I cannot tell" is not an observation;
* a gate the unfolder *did* resolve is no longer bounded by
  ``nyquist_reject_fraction`` of Nyquist but by an absolute physical speed,
  because that fraction exists to drop gates that might be folded and this
  one's fold state is known.  This is the entire recovery: at a Nyquist of
  25.51 m/s the 0.8 rule caps the assimilable wind at 20.4 m/s, and a
  mesocyclone's couplet lives above that.

**Aliasing is masked, not corrected** (the default path).  Four structural
defenses run, and it matters exactly what each of them can and cannot see:

1. a gate whose speed exceeds a configurable fraction of the sweep's Nyquist
   velocity is dropped and counted;
2. a sweep reporting no Nyquist velocity, or one outside the plausible band,
   has *every* velocity gate dropped and counted;
3. a cell whose retained gates disagree by more than a configurable fraction
   of Nyquist (a fold caught inside one cell) is dropped whole and counted;
4. a **gate-to-gate radial shear scan** along each radial, on the raw gates
   before any magnitude mask, flags range-adjacent pairs whose difference
   exceeds a fraction of the full Nyquist *interval* ``2 * Vn``.  A fold
   between neighbours produces a jump of very nearly ``2 * Vn``; the two
   gates flanking such a jump are dropped and counted, and per-sweep
   boundary counts go into provenance whether or not anything was dropped.

**What rule 4 can catch:** the *edge* of a folded region, where an unfolded
gate sits beside a folded one.  Both gates in such a pair are necessarily
near opposite Nyquist limits, which is the least trustworthy data in the
sweep, so the loss is narrow and lands where it should.

**What no rule here can catch:** a spatially coherent fold covering a whole
region.  At Nyquist 32 m/s a true +69 m/s folds to +5 m/s; a patch of gates
that all fold together has a present and plausible Nyquist, passes the
0.8 magnitude test, has zero in-cell spread, and has no gate-to-gate jump
anywhere in its interior.  It is a smooth, plausible, wrong wind field, and
it is assimilable.  Nothing short of true dealiasing, unwrapping the region
against a global reference rather than testing neighbours, excludes it.
The counters exist so that a region whose *boundary* was flagged is visible
in provenance even when its interior survived; they are evidence, not a
guarantee, and this module does not claim otherwise.

**A fifth mask is opt-in and dual-pol:** correlation-coefficient QC
(:mod:`woof.obs.cc_qc`), enabled by setting ``SuperobParams.cc_qc``.
It runs at the sweep level and *before* the gate-to-gate shear scan,
because non-meteorological echo corrupts fold-state evidence exactly the
way it corrupts everything else.

One ordering caveat, stated because it is a real divergence rather than a
detail.  QC upstream of *all* alias reasoning is the operational order,
and this mask does not achieve it when the region dealiaser is also on:
the unfolder runs once per sweep, above the block loop this mask lives
in, so it reasons about folds on a velocity plane these gates have not
yet been removed from.  What the mask drops is unaffected -- but not for
the reason first recorded here.  The drop decision *does* read velocity:
the debris-fringe exemption's couplet detector is handed a velocity
plane.  What makes the ordering harmless is WHERE the plans carrying
that detector are built -- once, above the block loop, over the volume's
RAW sweeps -- so the dropped set and every counter below are identical
either way.  It is the unfolder's evidence, not the mask's, that is not
the evidence this docstring would prefer it had.

RULING (2026-08-12, the 2.1 assembly): the ordering as assembled is
ACCEPTED for 2.1.  Masking the raw planes before the unfolder is called
is a change to this stage's shape, so it is to be settled by an A/B --
the couplet instrument plus a control region -- before any restructure,
never adopted on the strength of the operational order alone.

Its rule is per moment.  In
*reflectivity* it is compound (low RhoHV AND low reflectivity), never
RhoHV alone -- hail cores, the melting layer and the tornadic debris
signature legitimately depress RhoHV, and a bare threshold deletes
precisely the echo this pipeline exists to observe.  In *velocity*
there is no reflectivity shield: a low-RhoHV gate loses its velocity
however bright it is, debris core included, because a scatterer that
does not move with the air does not carry a wind observation.  One
band is exempted from that, on by default: the debris-signature
*fringe* -- 30 to 35 dBZ, RhoHV between the debris floor and the
velocity threshold, and beside a clustered velocity couplet in the
same sweep -- keeps its velocity, because that band is where a weak or
distant tornado's rotation lives and low RhoHV alone is not evidence
of debris.  Every exempted gate is counted.  Both the asymmetry and
the exemption are owner rulings and their reasoning is recorded in
:mod:`woof.obs.cc_qc`.  Where the
volume carries no RhoHV -- pre-2013 archives, cuts without a usable
dual-pol source, gates beyond the RHO extent -- the mask does nothing
and counts the absence; absent data never fabricates a pass or a fail.

    Accumulators only: the dBZ/velocity/error reduction happens once, in

    product go through exactly the same arithmetic.

    ``clear_air_from_censor`` selects the censored regime described in the
    module docstring.  It is off by default and the default path is
    unchanged, arithmetic included.  Asking for it against a pack that has
    no censor planes is a hard error rather than a silent downgrade: the
    caller asked for a coverage this volume cannot supply, and quietly
    returning the thin product under the wrong ``clear_air_source`` is the
    one outcome that would mislead the DA side.

    It is a keyword rather than a :class:`SuperobParams` field on purpose.
    ``SuperobParams.to_payload`` is serialized verbatim into every
    observation file's ``superob_params`` attribute, so a new field there
    would change the bytes of files that are otherwise identical -- and the
    regime is already recorded, exactly once and where a consumer looks for
    it, as ``clear_air_source``.

    ``velocity_reference`` is an optional
    :class:`woof.obs.dealias.WindProfile` -- the model background wind --
    used only when ``params.dealias`` is set, and used only to *supplement*
    the volume's own VAD: it seeds the harmonic fit and fills the range
    bands the fit could not qualify.  It is never allowed to override a
    band the volume itself resolved, because the volume measured the wind
    and the background guessed it.

    It belongs to the ``vad-region`` engine alone.  The region-global
    engine has no environmental reference in it, so supplying one beside
    that engine is refused rather than ignored: a caller who handed a
    background wind to a solver that never read it would get a run whose
    provenance says a treatment was applied and whose velocities were
    produced without it.

    #
    # Two conditions, and the second is the one that keeps this accurate.
    #
    # ``z0_count >= clear_air_min_gates`` says enough gates independently
    # measured this cell and found nothing.  ``~has_z`` says *no* radar saw
    # echo here.  The second is a veto, not a tiebreak: reflectivity is
    # summed across radars above, so ``has_z`` is true if ANY contributing
    # radar found echo in the cell, and a cell one radar calls clear while
    # another sees a storm in it is not clear.  The nearer radar is usually
    # the one seeing the storm -- the other is looking through it, over it,
    # or at a range where its beam has broadened past the cell -- so
    # deferring to the echo is also the physically right call, not merely
    # the conservative one.
    #
    # What this cannot see, and what therefore belongs in ``z0_err`` rather
    # than in this mask:
    #
    # * ATTENUATION.  A cell behind a heavy core can measure genuinely
    #   below-floor because the signal never got back, not because the sky
    #   is empty.  No attenuation correction exists in this lane
    #   (``woof.da.obsop`` states the same for the forward operator), so
    #   this is real, unmodelled, and one-sided towards false clear air.
    # * PARTIAL BEAM FILLING.  At range the sampling volume is much larger
    #   than a model cell; "clear where the beam looked" and "clear
    #   throughout the cell" diverge with distance.
    # * BEAM BLOCKAGE.  A blocked ray returns clutter (counted as echo, so
    #   harmless here) or nothing (NaN, so never counted at all) -- but a
    #   *partially* blocked ray returns a weakened real echo that can fall
    #   below the floor.
    #
    # None of the three can be detected from the gridded product alone.
    # They are the reason ``clear_air_error_dbz`` is a separate, larger
    # sigma_o rather than an inherited one.
