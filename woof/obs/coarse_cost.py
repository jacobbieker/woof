"""Native wrapped-cost surfaces for the dealiaser's coarse VAD search.

:func:`woof.obs.dealias.vad_reference` seeds its fold-aware harmonic fit
from an exhaustive search over a ``speed x direction`` grid of environmental
winds.  That search is the dominant cost of the whole observation front door
-- 1.13 million cosines per range band, twelve hundred bands in a volume --
and it is the one part of the dealiaser with no sequential dependence: every
band's search stands alone, so the whole sweep's worth can go to the parallel
Rust CPU backend in one call.

This module is the thin ctypes seam onto ``gpuwm_dealias_coarse_cost_f64``.
It deliberately reuses :func:`woof.ingest.cpu_backend.resolve_cpu_bridge`
rather than growing a second search order: there is one native preprocessing
library and it is found one way.

What the seam promises, and what it does not
--------------------------------------------
It returns a cost surface accurate to about 1e-11 absolute, not one that is
bit-identical to NumPy's.  The kernel rides a rotation recurrence along the
speed axis, which is a different summation of a different set of roundings.
So the caller must not rank candidates with these numbers alone -- and
:mod:`woof.obs.dealias` does not.  It shortlists with them, proves the
shortlist is sufficient, and ranks the shortlist with the same NumPy
expression the pure-Python path uses.  See ``_coarse_shortlisted`` there.

``WOOF_DEALIAS_NATIVE=0`` forces the pure NumPy path.  That is a diagnostic
and a workaround, not a supported mode: the native path is the default
wherever the library is present, and the parity test drives both.
