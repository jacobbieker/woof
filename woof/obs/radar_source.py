"""Which radar feed serves this observation, and what that cost in lag.

Two routes reach the same decoder.  The **archive** route lists
``{YYYY}/{MM}/{DD}/{SITE}/`` and downloads one Archive-II file per finished
volume; a volume file only exists once the volume has *ended*, so at a
random poll the newest one is on average half a volume period old and at
worst a whole one -- 3.4 to 6.8 minutes at a site running a 410 s VCP.  The
**live** route lists the real-time chunk feed and concatenates the chunks
published so far into the same Archive-II bytes; measured on 2026-08-05 the
newest chunk was 0-4 s old on every poll.

This module is the selector between them and nothing else.  It owns no
decode, no grid, no policy about what a good observation is: it returns a
file on disk plus a receipt saying which feed produced it, which objects it
is made of, whether the scan had finished, and the measured lag.  Everything
below it -- ``run_decode``, ``read_sweep_pack``, superob, the radar grid --
takes a path and never asks where it came from.

Three modes:

``archive``
    The route that exists today: nearest volume to ``valid_time``, refused
    when it is further away than ``max_offset_seconds``.

``live``
    The chunk feed, or a refusal.  Never silently falls back: a caller who
    asked for the live feed and got the archive would read a receipt saying
    "live" was requested and be told nothing about why it was not served.

``auto``
    Prefer live; fall back to the archive when the live feed cannot cover
    the request.  Every attempt, and why it was declined, lands in the
    receipt's ``attempts`` list -- so a fallback is a recorded event and not
    an absence.

**Partial volumes.**  A live assembly that stops mid-scan is a real product:
it ends on an LDM block boundary, the decoder reads the radials that
arrived, and that is what puts the lag under the scan time itself.  It is
also *never* the default.  ``allow_partial`` must be asked for, the receipt
records ``partial`` and the chunk count either way, and the file is named
``..._P{NNN}``, which the archive key parser refuses -- so a partial cannot
be mistaken for a finished volume by a name.

No case names belong here; sites and buckets are arguments.
