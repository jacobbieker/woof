"""Which radars can see this domain, computed rather than named.

One radar measures the wind component along its own beam and nothing else.
Two radars whose coverage overlaps measure two projections of the same wind,
and the pair constrains what neither can: that overlap is the single largest
information increment available from Level-II, and it is only reachable if
the pipeline can be told "cover this domain" instead of "use this site".

So this module answers one question -- *which sites cover this grid* -- from
the front door's own vendored NEXRAD site table (``rw_nexrad sites``,
schema ``gpuwm-obs.nexrad-sites.v1``) and the caller's own
:class:`~woof.obs.target_grid.TargetGrid`.  **No site id appears anywhere
in this file.**  Ids are results here, never inputs and never defaults.

**Coverage is a measured fraction, not a yes/no.**  A site whose disc clips
one corner of the domain and a site sitting over its centre are both "in
range", and treating them the same is how an analysis ends up dominated by
a radar that saw almost none of it.  :func:`sites_covering` returns, for
every candidate, the fraction of the domain's own mass points that fall
inside the site's usable range -- the same ``max_range_km`` the superobber
will apply -- so a caller can set a floor and the receipt can say what each
radar was actually asked to contribute.

**The table's altitudes are not used here and must not be.**  130 of the
table's 141 entries carry an unset elevation placeholder, which the decoder
refuses for exactly the right reason: the antenna height is the ray origin.
Discovery needs horizontal position only, and every volume that reaches the
superobber places its own antenna from its Message-31 VOL block.  Nothing
in this module feeds a gate height.

**Range is a planning radius, not a claim about what the beam did.**  The
disc this computes ignores terrain blockage, beam broadening and the cone
of silence.  It is the right tool for deciding which volumes to fetch and
the wrong one for deciding what an observation is worth; the superobber and
the per-radar counts in the receipt are where the second question gets
answered, on the data that actually arrived.
