"""Every radar that can see the domain, ingested as one observation set.

The single-site path (``tools/obs_radar_grid_build.py``) answers "what did
this antenna see?".  This module answers the question an analysis actually
asks: "what did every antenna that can see this domain see?" -- discover
the sites whose coverage intersects a domain, fetch and decode their
volumes concurrently, superob each onto the analysis grid, and merge.

Three properties this module exists to guarantee, none of which the
single-site path needed:

**Discovery is by coverage, not by name.**  A site belongs to a cycle when
some fraction of the analysis domain lies inside its usable range, and
that fraction is computed against the georeference the observations will
land on -- not against a bounding box, and never from a hardcoded roster.
No case names live here; sites are a *result*, and the catalogue is the
Rust site table read through ``rw_nexrad sites``.

**One site's bad night is not the cycle's bad night.**  A radar down for
maintenance, a mirror that 403s, a volume that fails its pack verify: each
is recorded against that site and the cycle continues with the rest.  The
one thing never permitted is a silent drop -- every discovered site
appears in the receipt with an outcome, and the number that actually
contributed is a field, so a cycle that quietly ran on two radars instead
of twenty cannot look like a cycle that ran on twenty.

**Concurrency is in the fetch, because that is where the time goes.**
Measured from Seoul against the Unidata mirror, a single stream pulls
about 2 MB/s while sixty-four concurrent streams pull about 37 MB/s: the
per-request latency, not the bandwidth, is what one-site-at-a-time spends
its night paying.  Decode and superob release the GIL (subprocess and
numpy respectively), so the same pool covers all three stages.

    many requests outstanding, and ``workers`` should be far larger than

    hops pools at the superob step, so a fast site's arithmetic overlaps a
    slow site's fetch rather than waiting for the whole roster to land.
