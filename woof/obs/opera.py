"""Drive the European radar-composite front door (``rw_opera``).

The wrapper is deliberately thin, because the shape it needs already exists:
:class:`woof.obs.frontdoor.FrontDoor` owns the resolution ladder, the
``--abi`` probe and the schema-checked JSON record, and this module supplies
the names and the six subcommand signatures. Nothing here decodes anything.

**What this route is, and what it is not.** ``rw_opera`` serves the EUMETNET
OPERA *composite*: one 1 km column-maximum reflectivity grid over Europe,
the direct counterpart of the MRMS composite this pipeline already scores
against, and the reason a European case can be graded at all. It is not a
polar volume: there is no radial velocity in it, no elevation geometry, and
therefore no path from it into the superob layer. That gap is real, it is
upstream, and :func:`polar_volume_support` states it in one place so a caller
asking for velocity is told why rather than handed reflectivity.

**Two sentinels.** The archive marks *no radar coverage* and *no echo* with
different values, and they are opposite claims: the first is unobserved, the
second is the network reporting that it looked and found nothing. The second
is the most common true observation on any frame and every correct negative a
skill score is built on. The front door separates them and counts both; this
module's contribution is to pin that in the ABI marker, so a binary that
stopped separating them cannot be probed as if it still did.
