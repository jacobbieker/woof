"""The region-global dealiasing engine: WOOF's Rust crate behind the seam.

:mod:`woof.obs.dealias` said it in its own docstring -- ``dealias_sweep``
was written against exactly what crosses the ingest seam "so that when the
plumbing exists it is replaced by a call, not by a rewrite."  This module is
that call.

What it drives
--------------
``region-global-dealias`` (`FahrenheitResearch/region-global-dealias
<https://github.com/FahrenheitResearch/region-global-dealias>`_) is WOOF's
Rust port of Py-ART's ``dealias_region_based`` (Helmus & Collis 2016), which
is itself the Jing & Wiener (1993) region method with a dynamic network
reduction over the region graph.  The crate is vendored verbatim under
:data:`CRATE_RELATIVE` at the upstream commit recorded in
:data:`UPSTREAM_COMMIT`; nothing in this tree modifies the solver, and the
vendor directory carries the BSD-3-Clause notice that travels with the
Py-ART derivation.

Why a shared library and not a binary
-------------------------------------
The house has both shapes.  ``tools/grib1_bridge`` builds executables that
speak a tabular contract over stdout (:mod:`woof.bridges`), and it builds
one **cdylib** driven through :mod:`ctypes` (:mod:`woof.ingest.cpu_backend`).
The rule that picks between them is what crosses the seam: a bridge that
moves *files* is a process, and a bridge that moves *arrays* is a library.

This one moves arrays.  A velocity sweep is ``rows * gates`` floats -- 3.4 MB
for a NEXRAD super-resolution cut -- and there are fourteen of them per
volume, on a path that runs per assimilation cycle.  Routing that through a
process would mean writing 48 MB to disk and reading it back per volume to
avoid a data copy the library route does not make at all.  The crate already
exports the C ABI this needs (``region_global_dealias.h``, ``bw_dealias`` and
``bw_dealias_rift_v1``), so the library route is also the one that requires
no wrapper crate around WOOF's code: woof calls his exported symbols
directly.

The ABI handshake is :func:`bw_abi_version`, checked against
:data:`REGION_DEALIAS_ABI` before any solve, exactly as
:class:`woof.ingest.cpu_backend.CpuPreprocessBackend` checks its own.  The
refinement path is versioned separately upstream and is checked separately
here: a library that predates it fails the RIFT probe instead of failing
inside a solve.

What this engine decides, and what it does not
----------------------------------------------
The two engines answer different questions and their gate decisions are
*expected* to differ:

* :mod:`woof.obs.dealias` (``vad-region``) anchors regions to an
  environmental VAD reference and **abstains** -- a region it cannot justify
  is rejected, and a gate that departs too far from the reference is
  rejected.  It is built for a filter that believes what it is handed.
* This engine (``region-global``) unfolds the whole region network jointly
  and **assigns a fold to every region it resolved**.  It carries no
  environmental reference, so it has nothing to abstain against: the
  solver itself refuses nothing, and every finite gate comes back from it
  either unchanged or unfolded.

That difference is the reason ``engine`` is a recorded parameter rather
than an implementation detail.  The three-state contract is preserved
exactly -- :data:`~woof.obs.dealias.STATE_REJECTED` is reachable for a
non-finite gate, for a sweep whose Nyquist cannot be believed, and for a
gate the physical bound below refuses -- so a consumer that reads
``state`` reads the same field whichever engine ran.

The physical bound
------------------
A solver that never abstains needs one check that does, or a region
resolved onto the wrong branch reaches the filter as a confident wind of
80-115 m/s.  :func:`~woof.obs.dealias.speed_bounded` is that check, and
it is the same one, by the same function and the same reason name, that
the VAD engine has always applied: a gate whose unfolded speed exceeds
:attr:`~woof.obs.dealias.DealiasParams.max_speed_ms` (75 m/s by default)
is REJECTED and counted under ``speed_out_of_range``.  Never clamped --
a clamped gate is a fabricated observation the filter cannot tell from a
measurement -- and never passed.

    Returns ``(believable_row, distinct)`` -- a boolean per radial and the

    **Why this engine refuses a nonuniform cut instead of serving it.**
    The native solver takes a per-ray Nyquist pointer, which reads as
    though it solves per ray.  It does not.  ``region_folds``
    (``solver.rs``) reduces the array with ``sweep_nyquist`` -- *the first
    usable element*, not the median and not the minimum -- and every
    cross-ray fold decision divides by that one interval, while
    ``apply_folds`` then applies the chosen integer at each ray's *own*
    interval.  On a cut split between 25.51 m/s and 32.0 m/s that decide/
    apply mismatch puts every corrected gate on the 32.0 m/s half 12.98 m/s
    out per fold, and multi-fold seams pick the wrong integer outright
    (a true 2-fold step reads as 2.509 and rounds to 3).  The error is
    finite, smooth, inside ``max_speed_ms``, and reported as a clean
    integer fold, so nothing downstream can see it.  Worse, because the
    scalar is the *first* usable element, rotating the same sweep changes
    the answer.

    So: this engine runs a uniform sweep, and a nonuniform sweep is the
    VAD-referenced engine's, which carries the array into its own
    arithmetic.  A radial with no believable value is a narrower case and
    is refused radial by radial rather than costing the sweep -- the
    remaining radials still share one interval, which is the only thing
    this solver needed.
