"""GOES cloud water path, from two packs to one gridded observation set.

This is the consumer the bridge's separate-pack ruling names.  ``rw_goes``
emits the 2 km CWP pack and the 10 km cloud-top pack and **never regrids**
between them, on the grounds that a resample buried in an ingest tool is
an interpolation no science reviewed.  This module is where that
interpolation happens, where it is chosen by name, and where it is written
into a receipt: :func:`join_cloud_top` states its method, its coverage,
and what it refused.

Three separate things happen here, and they are separate on purpose.

**The join** (:func:`join_cloud_top`) puts the 10 km cloud-top height onto
the 2 km CWP grid.  Default ``nearest``, in the geostationary fixed-grid
scan-angle space both packs carry -- not because nearest is more accurate
than bilinear in general, but because cloud-top height is *discontinuous
at a cloud edge* and a bilinear blend across that edge invents a height no
pixel observed.  ``bilinear`` is available and is recorded when used.

**The QC** (:func:`grid_cwp`) is three gates in series.  The bridge's DQF
gate already ran: condemned pixels arrive as ``NaN`` and this module
honours that by construction, carrying the rule and condemn mask into its
own receipt so the screening can be read downstream.  Then a *derivation
cross-check*: CWP is re-derived here from the pack's own ``cod``/``cps``/
``phase`` planes using the pack's own declared coefficients, and a pack
whose ``cwp`` plane does not reproduce is refused.  Then the superob
gates: minimum valid pixels, minimum valid fraction, and phase-class
uniformity.

**The error model** (:class:`CwpErrorModel`) requires explicit constants.
The automatic window caller supplies documented provisional values;
explicit pack gridding can supply another policy. Every value used is
written into the product's receipt and labelled UNCALIBRATED.

Units are g m-2 throughout, the pack's own unit and the unit
:func:`woof.da.obsop_cwp.simulated_cloud_water_path` returns.

    through lat/lon, and no assumption that the two grids' rows line up.

    ``method`` is ``"nearest"`` (the default) or ``"bilinear"``.  Nearest
    is the default because cloud-top height is discontinuous at a cloud
    edge: bilinear across that edge returns a height that lies between
    "cloud at 12 km" and "no cloud", which no pixel observed and which
    would place a CWP observation in clear air.

    ``coverage_slack`` is how far outside the cloud-top grid, in multiples
    of that grid's own spacing, a CWP pixel may sit and still be served.
    Beyond it the pixel gets ``NaN`` and is counted: the 10 km pack is a
    coarser sampling of the same sector, not a smaller one, so this should
    catch mismatched windows rather than edges.

    Returns ``(height_m_on_cwp_grid, receipt)``.  The receipt is the record
    the coordinator's ruling demands: it names the method, both grids, the
    pairing proof, and the counts.

    known is moved to the ground beneath that top
    (:func:`parallax_displacement`), a clear pixel stays where the ground
    is, and a cloudy pixel with no retrieved top stays at the ground and is
    counted in the receipt rather than moved by a height nobody measured.

    **On vertical placement.**  CWP is a column integral: it has no
    height, and the ``obs_level`` this returns is not a claim that it
    does.  The LETKF
    localises in metres about an observation's gridpoint, so a column
    observation has to be *centred* somewhere, and the centre chosen here
    is the retrieved cloud top where the join supplied one and
    ``fallback_placement_agl_m`` above the terrain where it did not.  The
    reach around that centre is the caller's vertical localisation radius,
    and for a column integral it must be set to span the column -- a
    4 km radius on a column observation is a 4 km-tall observation, which
    is not what was observed.  :mod:`woof.da.obs_goes` states this again
    at the point where the radius is applied.

    The mask carries exactly one observation per column.  A CWP value
    repeated down a column would be the same measurement counted ``nz``
    times, and the filter has no way to know it.
