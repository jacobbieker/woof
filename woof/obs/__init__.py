"""Observations for WOOF: acquisition, geometry, superobbing, and the
``gpuwm-obs.radar-grid`` contract the DA lanes consume.

The pipeline is four stages with a provable artifact between each pair:

``rw_nexrad fetch``   S3 -> Level-II volume on disk (+ sha256)
``rw_nexrad decode``  volume -> ``gpuwm-obs.radar-sweeps.v1`` pack
:mod:`woof.obs.superob`   pack + :class:`~woof.obs.target_grid.TargetGrid`
                           -> gridded accumulators
:mod:`woof.obs.radar_grid` -> ``gpuwm-obs.radar-grid`` NetCDF (v2 when
                           the set is windowed, v1 when it is not)

Nothing in here names a case, a campaign, or a particular radar: site ids,
bucket names and time windows are data that arrive through arguments.
