"""Locate and drive the vendored NEXRAD front door (``rw_nexrad``).

Same shape as :mod:`woof.rustwx_fetch`: the Rust bin moves bytes and
reports facts, Python decides what they mean, and the binary is *pointed
at* rather than built, through the resolution ladder
:mod:`woof.bridges` defines:

1. the ``WOOF_RW_NEXRAD`` environment variable naming the built file
   (a missing file it names is a hard error, never silently skipped);
2. a source checkout's ``tools/rustwx/target/{release,debug}``;
3. ``<root>/libexec/bridges`` beside the package;
4. ``~/.woof/bridges``.

Nothing here runs cargo.  Resolution has one side effect and one
only: an artifact found in ``~/.woof/bridges`` that is not the one this
release pinned is re-fetched before it is handed to a door
(:func:`woof.bridges.require_release_pin`).  ``woof doctor`` resolves
inside :func:`woof.bridges.inspection_only`, where there is no side
effect at all, so the report still says what the estate IS.
