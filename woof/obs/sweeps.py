"""Reader for the ``gpuwm-obs.radar-sweeps.v1`` pack that ``rw_nexrad`` writes.

The pack is a 64-byte little-endian header, a JSON metadata block, and one
contiguous payload of ``<f4`` arrays: the ``.rwg`` layout from ``rw-store``.
Reading it needs :mod:`json` and :func:`numpy.frombuffer` and nothing else,
which is the whole point: the Rust side owns bytes-to-numbers, the Python
side owns numbers-to-observations, and the seam between them is a file
format either can prove.

Every self-describing field the writer promised is checked before a caller
sees an array: magic, version, declared lengths, schema string, payload
digest, and that each array's declared shape accounts for exactly its
declared bytes inside the payload it indexes.  A pack that fails any of
those raises :class:`RadarSweepPackError`; nothing is returned partially.
