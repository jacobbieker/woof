"""``gpuwm-obs.radar-grid``: gridded radar observations, the DA front door.

This is the cross-lane contract: the DA lanes read this file and nothing
upstream of it.  Everything a data assimilation step needs to use an
observation is in here, and everything it must not have to guess is
refused rather than defaulted.

Dimensions
----------
``level``, ``south_north``, ``west_east``
    The target model grid, exactly.  A reader that disagrees on any of the
    three, or on ``grid_identity_sha256``, must stop.
``radar``
    Contributing radars, in the order they were merged.
``nchar``, ``ntime``
    Fixed widths for the radar id and ISO8601 timestamp strings.

Variables
---------
``z_obs`` [dBZ], ``z_mask``, ``z_err``
    Reflectivity, merged across radars.  ``z_max`` and ``z_mean`` ship
    beside ``z_obs`` because the choice between them is the consumer's, and
    neither is recoverable from the other.  ``z_mean`` is the linear-Z mean
    expressed in dBZ.
``vr_obs`` [m/s], ``vr_mask``, ``vr_err``
    Radial velocity, with a leading ``radar`` axis.  **This is a deliberate
    widening of the nominal ``(level, south_north, west_east)`` shape and
    the one place this writer adds a dimension rather than collapsing
    one.**  Two radars looking at one cell measure two different
    projections of the same wind; merging them produces a number with no
    observation operator, and dropping one throws away half the
    information.  The trailing three axes are still the target grid, so a
    consumer that wants a single radar indexes ``vr_obs[r]`` and is back on
    the nominal shape.
``vr_beam_east|north|up``
    The unit look vector per retained cell: ``Vr = u*east + v*north +
    w*up``.  A radial velocity without its look direction is not an
    observation, so the operator ships with the value.

Masks are ``int8``: ``1`` where a usable observation exists, ``0``
everywhere else.  There is no "maybe".  ``vr_rejected`` counts the gates
that were dropped for aliasing risk, so a zero mask over a storm reads as
"masked, and here is how many" rather than "no data".

**Dealiasing is off unless asked for.**  With ``SuperobParams.dealias``
unset -- the default -- see :mod:`woof.obs.superob` for the fail-closed
rules that mask aliasing rather than correct it, and this file is written
exactly as it always has been.  With it set, :mod:`woof.obs.dealias` has
unfolded the velocities and ``provenance.dealias`` carries the three-state
account of every gate it resolved, left alone, or refused.  The
``dealiasing`` attribute states which of the two this file is, and is the
first thing a consumer should read.

Which library moves the bytes
-----------------------------
Both halves are WOOF's Rust on the bare default.  The file is WRITTEN by the
classic writer at ``tools/rustwx/crates/netcdf-writer`` through
:mod:`woof.obs.grid_product`, in the CDF-5 container;
``WOOF_OBS_GRID_WRITER=python`` reaches the netCDF4/HDF5 writer this schema
used through 2.4 and is an announced workaround, never a fallback.  Every
OBSERVATION is READ back through :mod:`woof.netcdf_bridge`.

The file's METADATA -- its global attributes and the two fixed-width
character variables ``radar_id`` and ``radar_valid_time`` -- comes off one
netCDF4 open, the only netCDF4 read left in this module.  That is the split
``woof.downscale._parent_geometry`` already draws, and here it is forced:
the vendored netcrust reader exposes no character read at all, and it cannot
see an HDF5 attribute that landed in an object-header continuation block --
it returns ``None`` for one rather than failing.  A two-radar product's
``provenance`` is past that point, and every radar-grid file written before
this release is HDF5, so reading the metadata on the bridge turned "this
build cannot read the attribute" into "the file does not carry one" for the
whole assimilation record.  Values stay on the bridge; metadata does not.

#: They do not find aliasing.  A region of gates that folds *together* has
#: a present and plausible Nyquist, speeds well inside the 0.8 threshold,
#: no in-cell spread, and no gate-to-gate jump in its interior: a smooth,
#: plausible, wrong wind field that every rule here passes.  The
#: ``fold_suspicion`` block in provenance carries what the shear scan did
#: see, per sweep, including the sweeps where it saw nothing.
_DEALIASING_STATEMENT = (
    "none. Velocities are masked on four risk signatures -- speed above "
    "nyquist_reject_fraction of the sweep Nyquist, a missing or "
    "implausible Nyquist, in-cell spread above nyquist_spread_fraction, "
    "and gates flanking a gate-to-gate jump above shear_fold_fraction of "
    "the full Nyquist interval -- and every rejection is counted into "
    "vr_rejected and provenance.counts. These are signatures of risk, not "
    "detections of aliasing: a spatially coherent fold covering a whole "
    "region passes all four, because its interior is smooth and its speeds "
    "are small. Excluding that case requires true dealiasing, which is "
    "region-global unwrapping and is not implemented here. See "
    "provenance.fold_suspicion for the per-sweep shear-scan record."
)

#: What this file's velocities have been through when dealiasing DID run.
#:
#: The statement above is not merely reworded here, it is *retired* for this
#: file: its central claim -- "excluding that case requires true dealiasing,
#: which is region-global unwrapping and is not implemented here" -- stops
#: being true the moment the unfolder runs, and a provenance string that
#: understates what happened is as much a lie as one that overstates it.  A
#: consumer distinguishes the two files by this attribute and by the
#: presence of ``provenance.dealias``; neither can be forged by a rebuild,
#: because both are written from the same parameter object that produced the
#: velocities.
_DEALIASED_STATEMENT = (
    "region-based unfolding (woof.obs.dealias). Each sweep is segmented "
    "into regions whose adjacent gates differ by less than "
    "region_join_fraction of Nyquist, so no fold lies inside a region; "
    "regions are anchored to an absolute fold by a fold-aware VAD (Browning "
    "& Wexler 1968) fitted per range band and cross-checked against a wind "
    "profile pooled from every cut in the volume, which is believed at a "
    "height only where two or more different elevations reached it. A region "
    "may anchor only where it still looks environmental after unfolding, so "
    "a rotational couplet is never flattened onto the background wind. "
    "Remaining regions resolve across their strongest confident "
    "inter-region boundary. EVERY velocity gate ends in exactly "
    "one of three states -- confidently unfolded, confidently unchanged, or "
    "REJECTED with a recorded reason -- and all three are counted in "
    "provenance.dealias, whose totals are asserted to balance against the "
    "gates offered. Where the evidence is ambiguous the gate is rejected, "
    "not guessed: a region that is never anchored and never linked, a region "
    "on a contradicted boundary, a fold beyond max_fold, a speed beyond "
    "max_speed_ms, or a departure from the reference beyond "
    "max_reference_departure_ms. Because a resolved gate's fold state is "
    "KNOWN, it is "
    "bounded by max_speed_ms rather than by nyquist_reject_fraction of "
    "Nyquist; that fraction still governs every gate on a sweep the unfolder "
    "declined. See provenance.dealias.sweeps for the per-sweep account and "
    "provenance.fold_suspicion for the shear scan, which now runs on the "
    "UNFOLDED field and so measures what the unfolder missed."

#: What this file's velocities have been through when the REGION-GLOBAL
#: engine ran.
#:
#: A third statement rather than a footnote on the second, for the reason
#: the second is not a footnote on the first: the claim that separates them
#: is essential.  ``_DEALIASED_STATEMENT`` promises that every gate is
#: confidently unfolded, confidently unchanged, or REJECTED, and that where
#: the evidence is ambiguous the gate is rejected rather than guessed.
#: This engine makes no such promise -- it has no environmental reference
#: to be ambiguous against, and it assigns a fold to every region it
#: resolved.  A consumer reading a file made by this engine must not be
#: told it was made by an abstaining one.
_DEALIASED_STATEMENT_REGION_GLOBAL = (
    "region-global unfolding (woof.obs.dealias_region, driving the "
    "vendored region-global-dealias crate at tools/region_global_dealias -- "
    "a Rust port of Py-ART's dealias_region_based, Helmus & Collis 2016, "
    "verified fold-for-fold identical to Py-ART 2.2.5 on this pipeline's "
    "own decoded sweeps). Each sweep is segmented into regions that are "
    "internally fold-free, and the whole region network is unfolded "
    "JOINTLY: the strongest region pair merges first and every remaining "
    "connection is re-weighted with what that merge established, rather "
    "than each boundary being committed from local information alone. "
    "Regions separated by up to 100 gates of no-data are linked. THIS "
    "ENGINE DOES NOT ABSTAIN: it carries no environmental reference, and "
    "every region it resolved is assigned a fold, so provenance.dealias "
    "records gates as unchanged or unfolded and rejects only gates that "
    "were not numbers to begin with and gates on a sweep whose Nyquist "
    "could not be believed. It publishes no region-graph counts across its "
    "ABI, so provenance.dealias.totals reports those as null rather than "
    "as zero. Velocities are exact: a gate the solver did not move is "
    "returned bit-identically, and a gate it moved differs by a whole "
    "number of Nyquist intervals and nothing else. Because a resolved "
    "gate's fold state is known, it is bounded by max_speed_ms rather than "
    "by nyquist_reject_fraction of Nyquist. See provenance.dealias.sweeps "

    grid: pass the identity of the grid it intends to assimilate into, and a
    file written for any other grid raises instead of being silently
    regridded.

    ``expected_grid`` is how it fails closed on the grid *itself*, and it is
    what the DA read path always passes -- see
    :func:`woof.da.obs_radar.read_document`, which requires it.  The
    identity attribute is a claim the file makes about arrays it does not
    all contain: it is computed over the projection's definition, ``z_w``
    and terrain at float64, and the file stores only the coordinates and
    terrain, at float32.  A reader alone therefore cannot recompute it, so
    an attribute relabelled to name a different grid is consistent with
    everything a reader can check by itself.  Passing the consumer's own
    :class:`TargetGrid` re-derives the whole digest chain from arrays in
    hand and compares it to what the file recorded, which is the only check
    that reaches ``z_w``.  It implies ``expected_grid_identity``.

    Whatever the caller demands, the structural contract is always checked:
    every canonical variable present, with its exact dimension **tuple**,
    storage type and units, and every stored coordinate array hashing to
    the digest the writer bound to the identity.  A file that carries the
    right identity string over transposed or staggered variables is a
    refusal, not a regrid.

    ``mean_i(b_i . x) = (mean_i b_i) . x`` holds for any x, and only for the
    unnormalized mean.  So the stored vector is deliberately NOT unit
    length: its norm is the cell's beam coherence, in ``(0, 1]``, and it is
    1 exactly when the contributing beams were parallel.

    This check was written when the merge stored a renormalized vector and
    it required unit length.  That requirement died with the renormalization
    -- which inflated every modelled radial velocity by 1/c, 15.5% for beams
    60 degrees apart -- so what is checked here is the invariant the mean
    actually has, which still catches the breakage the unit check was for.
    A beam scaled by a regrid, by a "normalisation" against a different
    norm, or by a lossy storage step leaves this band, and every H(x) it
    touches is wrong by that factor while the innovations stay finite and
    plausible.

    The floor is the merge's own :data:`~woof.obs.superob.MIN_BEAM_COHERENCE`:
    below it the merge masks the cell off, so a true mask over a beam below
    the floor is a file whose mask and beams disagree about which cells are
    observations.

    NOTE for a later lane: the merge computes the coherence exactly and
    ``GriddedObservations`` carries it, but no schema variable stores it, so
