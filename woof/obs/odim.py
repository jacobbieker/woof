"""Drive the European polar-volume front door (``rw_odim``).

This is the other half of :mod:`woof.obs.opera`. That module serves the
EUMETNET OPERA *composite*: one 1 km column-maximum reflectivity grid over
Europe, which is a grader and not an assimilable observation, because a
composite has no radial velocity, no elevation geometry and no path into the
superob layer. This module serves the **per-site polar volume**, which has
all three.

The wrapper is thin for the same reason ``opera.py`` is:
:class:`woof.obs.frontdoor.FrontDoor` owns the resolution ladder, the
``--abi`` probe and the schema-checked JSON record, and this module supplies
the names and the three subcommand signatures. Nothing here decodes anything.

**What the pack it writes joins.** ``rw_odim pack`` writes
``gpuwm-obs.radar-sweeps.v3``, the same container ``rw_nexrad decode``
writes, read by the same :func:`woof.obs.sweeps.read_sweep_pack`. Everything
below that seam -- dealias, superob, ``radar_grid``, ``da.obs_radar``, LETKF
-- is not American and needs no European variant. That is the whole design:
one new pack writer, so that a European radial velocity is assimilated by
exactly the code that assimilates an American one.

**Two shapes of volume, and they are not interchangeable.** The Netherlands
and Romania publish one ``PVOL`` file per volume. Germany publishes one
``SCAN`` file per (elevation, quantity) pair, so a ten-elevation volume
carrying ``DBZH`` and ``VRADH`` arrives as twenty files that mean nothing
apart. :func:`run_pack` reads the first shape and :func:`run_pack_dir` the
second; :func:`run_volumes` says which shape a directory holds, and is what a
caller runs before deciding. A directory holding two nominal times is refused
rather than resolved by recency, because a volume glued out of two scans has
a wind field from the wrong minute in some of its columns and nothing
downstream can see it.

**Antenna altitude comes from the file.** ``/where/height`` is in every ODIM
volume, so the pack answers site altitude without consulting
``radar_sites_odim.json`` and :func:`woof.obs.radar_sites.require_assimilable`
never has to guess one.
