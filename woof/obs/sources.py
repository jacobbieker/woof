"""Observation sources: what the scorer asks of an archive, answered.

These are the ingest lane's side of the seam declared in
``woof.verify.obs.contracts``. Each class satisfies one of that module's
protocols over packs and records the Rust front doors wrote:

* :class:`MrmsCompositeSource`, ``GriddedObsSource`` for composite
  reflectivity in dBZ;
* :class:`OperaCompositeSource`, the same quantity from the European
  network, for domains MRMS does not cover;
* :class:`Stage4PrecipSource`, ``GriddedObsSource`` for one accumulation
  window of precipitation in mm;
* :class:`AsosSurfaceSource`: ``StationObsSource`` for surface reports in
  SI.

The contracts module is imported lazily, and deliberately. The scorer lane
and this lane land in separate integration waves; a module-level import
would make every ingest test depend on the other lane's tree being present,
which is exactly the coupling the seam exists to avoid. Constructing a
source without the contracts module raises and says so.

**Frame selection.** A source answers a valid time with the nearest frame
inside its registered matching window. Under a registered coverage floor
(``minimum_observed_fraction``, registration v2.1) it answers with the
nearest frame that *meets* the floor, walking outward inside the same
window; the window never widens. When the window holds frames but none of
them clears the floor, the source raises the seam's
``ObservedFractionBelowFloor`` so the scorer can record that lead as
missing-obs by name -- an upstream ingest outage should not be scored as if
it were weather, and it should not kill a case either.

**Re-hashing.** Every source exposes ``verify(provenance)``, which re-reads
the archive object the provenance names and compares its digest to the one
taken at fetch. The promotion rule's integrity clause requires that round
trip on every scored input, and an unperformed check counts as a failed one:
a missing artifact raises (that is a wiring fault) and a changed one returns
False (that is the corruption this exists to catch).

        The front doors record an absolute path, so the common case needs
