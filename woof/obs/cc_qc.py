"""Correlation-coefficient (RhoHV) quality control for radar superobbing.

Dual-pol RhoHV separates meteorological from non-meteorological echo:
rain and snow return 0.97-0.99+ (Kumjian 2013, J. Operational Meteor.;
Ryzhkov & Zrnic 2019), while biota, chaff and ground clutter return
0.3-0.8 and almost never exceed 0.9 (Zrnic & Ryzhkov 1998, BAMS; Park
et al. 2009, WAF).  A bird layer that survives into the superob grid is
assimilated as a storm, and a bird layer in the velocity field corrupts
every wind it touches.  This mask exists to remove that echo before it
becomes an observation.

**The rule is per moment, and the two moments are not symmetric.**
Severe weather legitimately depresses RhoHV: hail cores run 0.85-0.95
and giant hail lower (Balakrishnan & Zrnic 1990; Kumjian 2013), the
melting layer dips to 0.90-0.97 (Giangrande et al. 2008, JAMC), and the
tornadic debris signature falls below 0.8 -- often below 0.7 -- exactly
at the mesocyclone couplet (Ryzhkov et al. 2005, JAM; Bodine et al.
2013, WAF).  All three are *genuine echo*: hail, melting ice and lofted
debris really are up there, and deleting them from the reflectivity
field would be deleting the storm.  Whether their motion is an
observation of the *wind* is a separate question with a separate
answer, so this mask answers it separately.

**Reflectivity is shielded.**  A reflectivity gate is dropped only when
its RhoHV is low **and** its co-located reflectivity is below
``ref_shield_dbz``.  That is operational practice: MRMS drops low-RhoHV
echo only where the compound evidence says non-precipitation (Tang et
al. 2014, WAF 29, 1106-1119), and the WSR-88D ORPG classifies with
fuzzy logic (Park et al. 2009) rather than a bare threshold.  Hail
cores, debris signatures and the bright-band peak all carry
reflectivity above any plausible shield, so they survive in this moment
by construction, and the tests that prove it live in
``tests/test_cc_qc.py``.

**Velocity carries no reflectivity shield.**  A velocity gate whose
RhoHV is low is dropped whatever its reflectivity -- including,
deliberately and explicitly, the velocity at the 45 dBZ core of a
tornadic debris signature.  This is an owner ruling (2026-08-05,
relayed from consulting meteorologists) and it withdraws the
reflectivity shield from this moment entirely.  The reason is physical
rather than procedural: a Doppler velocity is an observation of the
*air* only if the scatterer moves with the air, and debris does not.
Lofted boards, soil and vegetation are large, irregular, non-Rayleigh
scatterers centrifuged outward by the vortex, so their radial velocity
carries a systematic outward bias and an enormous spectrum width --
Ryzhkov et al. (2005) and Bodine et al. (2013) identify the TDS by
exactly that non-meteorological scattering, and the property that makes
the signature diagnostic is the property that makes its velocity wrong.
Assimilated, it would place a confidently mis-specified wind at the one
point in the domain where the analysis matters most.  A missing
observation beats a confidently wrong one, so the debris core is left
to the surrounding meteorological gates instead of being filled in with
debris motion.  The same argument covers hail cores and the melting
layer: their reflectivity is kept because the ice is real, their
velocity is dropped because tumbling, fast-falling and mixed-phase
scatterers are not tracers of the wind.  The cost is counted rather
than hidden -- ``gates_dropped_shielded_z`` records, per sweep and per
moment, exactly how many velocity gates the reflectivity shield would
have kept -- and ``rho_min_velocity`` is the one knob that would
revisit the ruling wholesale without a code change.

**One narrow band is exempted from that rule, by name and by
measurement: the debris-signature fringe.**  Owner ruling 2026-08-12,
closing the seam the 2026-08-05 verification found.  A TDS is admitted
in the literature down to about 30 dBZ (Ryzhkov et al. 2005; Bodine et
al. 2013), so the weak or distant signature -- the one a forecaster
most needs a wind analysis to see -- lives in the 30-35 dBZ band, below
the reflectivity shield.  Under the unshielded velocity rule that whole
band lost its velocity, and with it the rotational couplet of every
tornado too far away or too weak to paint a 35 dBZ debris core.  The
exemption keeps those velocities, and it is deliberately conjunctive:
**low RhoHV alone is never enough.**  A gate is exempted only when all
five of these hold, each with a stated threshold and a receipt counter
for the gates it turns away:

1. the strict rule would drop it (RhoHV below the velocity threshold);
2. RhoHV is at or above ``tds_rho_floor`` (0.50) -- a debris floor.
   Measured TDS RhoHV runs 0.5-0.8; below 0.5 the return is
   receiver-noise or thin biota, and no amount of surrounding rotation
   makes noise into a wind observation;
3. reflectivity is at or above ``tds_ref_min_dbz`` (30.0) -- the
   literature's TDS admission threshold, and above the 25-30 dBZ band
   where roosting-bird echo peaks;
4. reflectivity is *below* ``ref_shield_dbz`` (35.0).  The exemption is
   a band, not a new shield: at and above 35 dBZ the 2026-08-05 ruling
   stands untouched, because the debris core is exactly where the
   centrifuging bias is largest and where the surrounding
   meteorological gates are densest;
5. the gate sits inside the rotation neighbourhood of an accepted
   **velocity-couplet seed** in the same sweep (see below).

Criterion 5 is what separates a debris fringe from a field of birds
that happen to return 32 dBZ.  Debris is lofted *by a vortex*; if there
is no vortex signature in the velocity field beside the gate, whatever
depressed its RhoHV was not a tornado.  ``tds_fringe_exempt`` is on by
default because a correctness remedy that has to be switched on is a
workaround.  Setting it False restores the 2026-08-05 verdict on every
gate -- the couplet scan does not even run -- and the receipt says
which ruling was in force.  The observation arrays are then identical
to a pre-ruling build; the receipt is not, because it gains this
paragraph's counters reading zero, which is the difference between a
mask that did nothing and a mask that was not there.

**The couplet instrument, and what it cannot do.**  Seeds are found on
the sweep's own raw velocity plane, the same signature the dealiasing
work uses to locate couplets: an azimuthally adjacent radial pair, at
the same gate and within ``tds_couplet_max_azimuth_gap_deg`` of each
other, whose velocities have opposite sign, whose magnitudes both reach
``tds_couplet_lobe_ms``, and whose difference reaches
``tds_couplet_delta_v_ms`` -- 30 m/s across one beam pair, the
operational gate-to-gate delta-V band for a tornadic vortex signature.
A lone pair is noise, so a seed only counts inside a cluster of at
least ``tds_couplet_min_seeds`` within a
``tds_couplet_cluster_radius``-gate box, and the exemption region is
that cluster grown by ``tds_rotation_radius_radials`` radials and
``tds_rotation_radius_gates`` gates -- roughly 3 degrees by 3 km on a
super-res cut, the scale over which a debris fringe surrounds its
couplet.

This runs *before* dealiasing, on raw folded velocities, and that is a
real limit rather than an oversight: a Nyquist-crossing straight-line
jet also produces adjacent opposite-signed gates, so the instrument
cannot in principle distinguish a compact couplet from a compact fold
seam.  What bounds the damage is the conjunction -- such a seam must
*also* sit in the 30-35 dBZ band with RhoHV between 0.50 and the
velocity threshold before a single gate is exempted -- and the count:
``gates_exempt_tds_fringe`` is the exact number of velocity gates this
rule kept that the 2026-08-05 ruling would have deleted, per sweep and
per moment, so the exemption is auditable as a number rather than
argued as a policy.

**Split cuts are paired, because the real volumes force it.**  On a
2026 WSR-88D volume (measured, KDMX VCP with SAILS revisits) the
split-cut tilts publish dual-pol moments on the surveillance (CS) half
only: CS cuts carry REF+RHO and no VEL, the adjacent Doppler (CD) cuts
carry REF+VEL and no RHO.  A same-sweep-only mask would therefore never
QC velocity at the lowest tilts -- the tilts where both the biota and
the couplet live -- and would leave the CD half's reflectivity
uncleaned beside the cleaned CS half, so the cell-level maximum kept
the bird echo anyway.  The ORPG's own split-cut recombination pairs
exactly these adjacent cuts (WSR-88D ICD 2620002; the halves are
seconds apart), and this module does the same: a sweep without RHO
borrows its immediate neighbour's, preceding sweep first (in every
WSR-88D VCP the CS half precedes its CD half), guarded by an elevation
tolerance that keeps a distinctly different tilt from qualifying, and
matched radial-by-radial by nearest azimuth.  The ICD's stated
effective azimuthal resolution of the dual-pol variables is 1.0 degree
even on 0.5-degree radials, which is where the azimuth tolerance
default comes from.

**Absent data never fabricates a verdict.**  Dual-pol absence is
legitimate at three granularities -- whole volume (the fleet retrofit
completed mid-2013; earlier archives have no RHO at all), whole sweep
(a cut with no usable RHO source), and gate (RHO censored at the
receiver, or a reflectivity gate beyond RHO's extent).  In every case
the gate passes through exactly as it would have in 2012, and the
absence is counted in provenance.  An absent RhoHV is not a failed
test: the gate's velocity is precisely as trustworthy as it was before
the radar grew a second polarization.  (Contrast the Nyquist mask in
:mod:`woof.obs.superob`, which fails closed -- a velocity without an
alias test is untrustworthy in itself.  A velocity without a RhoHV is
not.)

**Known limits, stated rather than hidden.**  The RhoHV estimator is
biased low at low SNR (Melnikov & Zrnic 2007, JTECH), and the pack
carries no SNR plane, so weak far-range precipitation shows depressed,
noisy CC.  In reflectivity the shield is the mitigation and the
residual risk sits at stratiform bright-band edges near 25-30 dBZ,
below any shield that still catches heavy biota.  In velocity there is
no mitigation and the cost is larger by construction: far-range weak
precipitation with a noisy low CC loses its velocity outright.  That is
the price of the purity ruling, it is paid where the observations are
weakest rather than where they are best, and ``rho_min_velocity`` is
the knob that buys some of it back.  ``rho_floor`` -- an unconditional
drop below a second, lower threshold -- survives as a tunable but is
now effectively a *reflectivity* knob, because velocity already drops
unconditionally below its own threshold; it defaults **off** because
the debris and hail reflectivity it would delete is exactly what the
shield exists to keep.

Two smaller qualifications, since a docstring that overstates is worse than
one that omits.  Companion pairing is guarded by an elevation
tolerance, but adjacency alone does not make a different tilt
impossible: a Doppler cut whose preceding neighbour lacks RhoHV can
borrow a *following* cut within the tolerance.  No real WSR-88D VCP
orders its cuts that way -- every pairing on the six measured volumes
is a true CS/CD half -- but the guard is a tolerance, not a proof.  And
the thresholds are compared in float64 against values that arrive as
float32, so a stored CC of exactly ``rho_min`` reads a hair below it
and dies; real Level-II RhoHV is quantized in ~1/300 steps, so the
coincidence is not reachable in practice, but the comparison is not
exact and does not pretend to be.
