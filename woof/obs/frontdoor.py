"""Locate and drive one of the vendored observation front doors.

:mod:`woof.obs.nexrad` established the shape: resolution ladder, ``--abi``
probe, JSON record with a checked schema, for one binary. The battery adds
four more (``rw_mrms``, ``rw_stage4``, ``rw_asos``, ``rw_goes``), and four
more copies of that shape is four places for the ladder to drift. So the
shape lives here once and each instrument module supplies its own names.

``woof obs`` (:mod:`woof.obs.cli`) is the product door onto these.
Until it existed this module resolved four binaries and refused for
four, and a whole-tree search for its own name returned no importers:
it shipped, it resolved, it refused, and nobody could invoke it.

The ladder, unchanged:

1. the instrument's environment variable naming the built file (a missing
   file it names is a hard error, never silently skipped);
2. a source checkout's ``tools/rustwx/target/{release,debug}``;
3. ``<root>/libexec/bridges`` beside the package;
4. ``~/.woof/bridges``.

Nothing here runs cargo.  Resolution has one side effect and one
only: an artifact found in ``~/.woof/bridges`` that is not the one this
release pinned is re-fetched before it is handed to a door
(:func:`woof.bridges.require_release_pin`).  ``woof doctor`` resolves
inside :func:`woof.bridges.inspection_only`, where there is no side
effect at all, so the report still says what the estate IS.

#: coordinates, so the georeference has an oracle inside it, and the front
#: door proves itself against that oracle on every decode. A build without
#: that check is a different instrument and must not answer to this name.
#:
#: ``no_coverage`` and ``no_echo`` are in it for the same reason: the archive
#: marks *unobserved* and *observed empty* with different sentinels, and a
#: build that collapsed them would delete every correct negative a skill
#: score is built on while still printing a plausible record.

#:
#: The composite's counterpart and not a variant of it: ``rw_opera`` serves a
#: 2-D reflectivity grid that can grade a forecast, and ``rw_odim`` serves the
#: per-site polar scan that can be *assimilated*, because it carries radial
#: velocity and the elevation geometry an observation operator needs.
#:
#: Four things are in the marker because a build that dropped any of them
#: would still print a plausible record:
#:
#: ``undetect``/``nodata`` -- ODIM reserves two sentinels per moment and they
#: are opposite claims. ``undetect`` is the radar reporting it looked and
#: found nothing, which is a clear-air observation and the most common true
#: one on any scan; ``nodata`` is the radar reporting it did not look. A build
#: that collapsed them would delete every correct negative while still
#: decoding.
#:
#: ``sentinel_ambiguous`` -- Finnish ``VRADH`` declares both sentinels as the
#: same raw value, so some gates are genuinely undecidable. They get their own
#: code and are reported as not observed. Measured at 721,898 gates in one
#: volume, so this is not a corner case.
#:
#: ``nyquist_granularity`` -- ODIM has one ``NI`` per cut and no per-ray
#: Nyquist. The pack says so rather than broadcasting one number across the
#: radials, which is what lets the dealiaser tell "this format never had
#: per-radial originals" from "they were dropped".
#:
#: ``assembled``/``manifest_sha256`` -- some national feeds publish one file
#: per elevation and quantity, and a pack built from many files cannot quote a
#: file digest. A build without the assembly leg cannot serve Germany at all.

#:
#: ``goes`` is the satellite twin of ``nexrad``: it writes the ``.goespack``

#:
#: ``opera`` is the composite-reflectivity grader for domains MRMS does not
#: cover. It serves the same quantity in the same units through the same pack
#: schema, so a consumer picks a grader by region rather than by code path.
#:
#: ``odim`` is the assimilable European route and pairs with ``nexrad`` in the
#: same way: both write ``gpuwm-obs.radar-sweeps`` packs that the one sweeps
#: reader accepts, so a superob picks a decoder by which network covers the
