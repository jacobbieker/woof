"""EXPERIMENTAL: the real-radar ``assimilate()`` for the cycle driver.

Every piece of a real radar analysis already ships -- the NEXRAD front
door and superob writer produce ``gpuwm-obs.radar-grid.v1`` files, the
:mod:`woof.da.obs_radar` adapter turns one into filter batches, the
LETKF returns increments, and :mod:`woof.ensemble.cycle` owns the seam
those increments go through.  What did not ship is the callable the seam
takes: something that reads REAL member checkpoints, evaluates H(x) on
them, and hands the driver increments in the checkpoint's own field
vocabulary.  The synthetic gate (:mod:`woof.da.synthetic_cycle`) is not
that callable -- its members are mass-point dicts a stand-in dycore wrote,
while a real ``gpuwmrst`` checkpoint carries ARW-staggered winds -- and
the one real-data LETKF cycle run to date had to be assembled by hand on
the node because of exactly that gap.  This module is the missing brain.

Three decisions here shape the module:

**The filter analyses mass-point, grid-relative winds; the checkpoint
receives face-point increments.**  The LETKF requires every analysis
field on one ``(R, nz, ny, nx)`` grid, and a checkpoint's ``u`` is
``(nz, ny, nx+1)``.  So winds are destaggered to mass points for the
prior, and the returned wind increments are linearly interpolated back
onto the faces (interior face = mean of its two mass neighbours, rim
face = its one neighbour -- constant fields survive the round trip
exactly).  The analysed pair stays GRID-relative: the filter relates
state to observations only through ensemble covariances with H(x), so
the frame of the analysed field is free, and choosing the state's own
frame means the increments add to ``state/u`` and ``state/v`` with no
rotation on the way back.  The rotation lives inside H(x), where the
beam is.

**H(x) uses the grid's own rotation, not the checkpoint's.**
``SINALPHA``/``COSALPHA`` are setup arrays and a restart deliberately
does not carry them.  The observation file is bound to the caller's
:class:`~woof.obs.target_grid.TargetGrid`, whose projection is verified
against the wrfout's own XLAT/XLONG -- so ``grid.projection.rotation``
is the same authority the observations were placed with, and the one
this module uses to rotate member winds into the beam's earth frame.

**Radial velocity projects onto the file's beam vectors.**  Straight
from :mod:`woof.da.obs_radar`: the superob writer shipped the
normalised per-cell beam direction precisely so the assimilating side
does not re-derive geometry.  The vertical component is ``w - vt`` when
a reflectivity provider is configured (Sun and Crook fall speed from the
scheme's own dBZ, surface pressure taken as the lowest mass level's full
pressure -- within the bottom half-layer of the true surface value,
versus the +4-15% systematic error of the ``P0`` substitution the
operator refuses), and plain ``w`` under the explicit
``fall_speed="none"`` simplification.

Reflectivity H(x) needs the scheme and the base state.  A checkpoint
carries ``thp`` but not ``thb`` (base state is SETUP, rebuilt at
restore), so temperature is not derivable from the checkpoint alone.
:func:`scheme_reflectivity_provider` takes the run config and the base
theta explicitly and refuses nothing silently; without a provider,
``reflectivity=True`` and ``fall_speed="reflectivity"`` are refusals
that name what is missing.

Nothing here is wired into a default route.  EXPERIMENTAL.

        # (audit R-051).
        #
        # WHERE THAT IS EARLY ENOUGH IS THE CALLER'S HALF, and this class
        # cannot buy it alone: a driver that builds this configuration at
        # its first analysis seam has already spent an ensemble
        # integration whatever this __post_init__ does.  So the cycling
        # driver plans the configuration where the cycle is planned --
        # tools/da_cycle_prepared.py's plan_radar_assimilation, called
        # above the leg loop, before a member takes a step -- and builds
        # the leg's real one through the same function.  A driver that
        # skips that call gets its refusal at its first analysis, which is
        # the defect R-051 named, so the call is pinned by
        # tests/test_da_cycle_prepared.py rather than by this sentence.

        # reflectivity observations are assimilated.
        #
        # ASKED ONLY OF A CYCLE THAT STATES ITS SCHEME.  A first pass at
        # this gate also refused mp_physics=None, and that was a refusal of
        # configurations that run: nothing in this module derives the
        # operator from this field.  The provider is the CALLER's
        # (assimilate_radar_grid takes reflectivity_provider, built by
        # scheme_reflectivity_provider off the RUN config, which dispatches
        # on run_cfg.mp_physics), and cfg.mp_physics is read only by the
        # moment policy -- which documents None as "detect the pairs from
        # the checkpoint's own spellings" -- by the clear-air floor, which
        # is separately guarded below, and by a provenance label.  Refusing
        # None also contradicted the unimplemented-selector sentence below,

    """One LETKF analysis over member checkpoints, radar and/or satellite.

    The name is kept because every call site uses it; the function is now
    the multi-source analysis.  Radar observations and GOES cloud water
    path go into the same solve as separate batches with their own errors,
    thinning and localisation, which is the only arrangement in which a
    satellite column integral and a radar gate can constrain the same
    state without one being re-expressed as the other.

    Parameters
    ----------
    checkpoints
        ``{member_index: checkpoint path}`` -- each member's background,
        the file the driver will add the increments to.
    observations
        A ``gpuwm-obs.radar-grid.v1`` path or an already-read document.
        May be ``None`` when none of ``cfg.velocity``, ``cfg.reflectivity``
        or ``cfg.clear_air`` is set -- a satellite-only analysis.
    grid
        The caller's own :class:`~woof.obs.target_grid.TargetGrid`; every
        observation file is bound to its arrays (``z_w`` included), never
        to an identity string.
    cfg
        :class:`RadarAssimilationConfig`.
    reflectivity_provider
        ``(member_index, state_arrays) -> (nz, ny, nx) dBZ``; required
        when ``cfg.reflectivity`` or ``cfg.fall_speed == "reflectivity"``.
        :func:`scheme_reflectivity_provider` builds the scheme-true one.
    extra_obs
        Additional, already-validated :class:`~woof.da.letkf.GriddedObs`
        batches to solve in the SAME analysis (surface observations from
        :mod:`woof.da.obs_surface`, for instance).  The filter batches
        observation types independently, so appending them here is the
        whole integration -- but they must be on this very grid, with
        member axis in ascending checkpoint-index order, and their
        simulated H(x) already evaluated; this function cannot check the
        physics that produced them, only their shapes (the filter does
        that).  Their innovation statistics join the radar ones in the
        provenance.
    extra_obs_provenance
        JSON-serialisable provenance for ``extra_obs``, recorded verbatim
        under ``extra_observations``.  Required whenever ``extra_obs`` is
        non-empty: unattributed observations do not enter an analysis.
    cwp_observations
        A ``gpuwm-obs.goes-grid.v1`` path or document; required when
        ``cfg.cwp``.
    cwp_provider
        ``(member_index, state_arrays, obs_class) -> (ny, nx) g m-2``;
        required when ``cfg.cwp``.
        :func:`woof.da.obsop_cwp.checkpoint_cwp_provider` builds it.  It
        takes the observation's phase class because the operator composes
        model condensate under the phase the retrieval saw, never the
        model's own -- see :mod:`woof.da.obsop_cwp`.

    analysis_runner
        Optional transform with the same contract as letkf.analyze. Local
        deterministic cycling uses the static covariance mean transform;
        the default remains the existing ensemble transform.

    Returns
    -------
    ``(increments_by_member, provenance)`` in exactly the shape the cycle
    driver's seam consumes: ``{member_index: {field: ndarray}}`` with
    every array matching the CHECKPOINT shape of its field (winds on
    faces), and a JSON-serialisable method-provenance mapping carrying
    the adapter provenance, the observation-space innovation statistics
    and the filter diagnostics.
