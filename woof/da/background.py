"""Source metadata for the background the regional cycling driver starts from.

The driver has always ridden ONE deterministic background and made its
ensemble by perturbing it (:mod:`woof.da.perturb`, applied once at leg
0).  That is source-independent: nothing in the spread mechanism reads
the background's provenance.  What IS source-dependent is everything
around it -- how far back the newest usable cycle is, how many forecast
hours that cycle publishes, whether the source's native grid even
reaches the domain, and what the first guess contains.

This module is that source-dependent half, in one place, as data.  It
is deliberately a REGISTRY rather than an if/else on a source name:
HRRR is on NOAA's retirement path behind RRFS, so the next background
this driver learns must be an entry here, not another branch.

Three things live here and nothing else:

1. :data:`BACKGROUND_SOURCES` -- a live source-registry projection of cycle cadence, publication
   lag, forecast horizon and forcing interval, plus the coverage
   question, with the numbers each source's own contract module owns
   (:mod:`woof.hrrr_forecast` for HRRR's 18 h/48 h horizon,
   :mod:`woof.ingest.hrrr_target` for its grid envelope).
2. :func:`plan_background_cycle` -- the newest cycle at or before a
   requested model init whose files are plausibly published, and the
   forecast hour that init falls on.  Refuses past the horizon.
3. :func:`plan_member_backgrounds` -- HOW each trajectory's background
   was constructed, one record per trajectory, with the refusals that
   keep an ensemble from being fabricated.

Nothing here reaches the network, the GPU, or a prepared bundle.  It is
plan-time arithmetic and refusals, so a front door can prove a case is
buildable before it pays for a byte.

Compatibility timing defaults are not a capability roster.
