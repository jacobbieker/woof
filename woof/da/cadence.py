"""How often to assimilate, and what that cadence does to the tuning.

A WSR-88D in a precipitation VCP finishes a volume every 4-7 minutes.  A
cycle that fires every 15 minutes therefore ignores roughly two of every
three volumes the radar produced -- not because they arrived too late (the
live chunk feed delivers them mid-scan at a few seconds' lag) and not
because the cycle cannot afford them, but because the interval was a
constant.  This module makes the interval a *policy*, with the fixed one
preserved exactly.

Two modes:

``fixed``
    Analyses on a regular interval, choosing the volume nearest each mark.
    The behaviour the lane has today; reproduced here so that the A/B has
    a baseline arm and not a reconstruction of one.

``per-volume``
    One analysis per volume the radar actually produced, so the cycle
    length is whatever the antenna did -- 295 s and 418 s in the same hour
    when the VCP changes underneath it.

**The tuning is not cadence-invariant, and this module refuses to pretend
it is.**  Observation error, localization and inflation were all set
against 15-minute increments.  Two of the three have a defensible scaling
and one does not, and the difference is stated rather than smoothed over.

*Inflation (RTPS) scales, and here is the argument.*  RTPS relaxes the
posterior spread back toward the prior: ``sigma_a <- sigma_a [alpha
sigma_b/sigma_a + (1 - alpha)]``.  The quantity ``1 - alpha`` is the
fraction of the raw filter contraction that is allowed to stand at each
analysis -- a per-*cycle* deficit standing in for a continuous process.
Cycling k times more often applies that deficit k times more often, so
holding it per cycle draws spread down k times faster per unit time, which
is exactly the failure mode a shorter cadence is accused of.  Holding it
per unit *time* instead:

    (1 - alpha') / dt' = (1 - alpha) / dt      =>
    alpha' = 1 - (1 - alpha) * dt' / dt

is the discretization-consistent choice: the ensemble sees the same total
relaxation per quarter hour however many analyses that quarter hour is cut
into, which is the property the 15-minute tuning actually established.  At
alpha = 0.9 and dt = 900 s, a 340 s cadence wants alpha' = 0.962.

*Observation error scales, and here is the weaker argument.*  Volumes 5.7
minutes apart share beam geometry, clutter, ground targets and
representativeness error against a 3 km mass grid; their errors are
correlated on a timescale comparable to the volume period itself.
Assimilating them as independent multiplies the effective observation
count by ``dt / dt'``.  Inflating sigma_o by ``sqrt(dt / dt')`` restores
the information content per unit time to the tuned value, so a
shorter-cadence arm can only win through the *timeliness* of its
corrections and never through quietly counting the same radar twice.
The scaling is **one-sided**: ``max(1, sqrt(dt / dt'))``.  Run backwards
it would say a slower cadence makes each observation more accurate,
which is a claim about the radar rather than about the cadence -- and
the filter refuses an observation-error inflation below 1 for that exact
reason, which is how a first per-volume leg longer than the baseline
took an arm down.
This is deliberately conservative.  If the A/B shows the scaled arm losing
to the unscaled one, the correlation assumption is too strong and the
exponent belongs somewhere between 0 and 0.5 -- which is a measurement
this module cannot make for the caller.

*Localization does NOT scale, and inventing one would be dressing a guess
as a derivation.*  The radius is set by the ensemble's sampling-error
structure and by the physical correlation length of the increment, neither
of which is a function of how often the filter runs.  Shorter cycles do
mean less error growth between analyses, which argues weakly for a shorter
radius; that is second order, it was never measured at 15 minutes either,
and it is left exposed and flagged for retuning rather than scaled.

**Nothing here is applied silently.**  :func:`scaled_settings` returns the
scaled values *and* the reasoning *and* the untouched originals, every
caller records the whole block, and ``scaling="none"`` is a first-class
choice that keeps the old constants on purpose -- which is the control arm
an A/B needs, not an oversight.

No site names, no case names: volume times and intervals are arguments.

    ``cycle_cost_seconds`` is a wall time for one assimilation cycle on
    the hardware that will run it, and ``cost_basis`` says where it came
    from.  The default, ``measured``, is the case this check was written
    for: a plan that cannot keep up is caught before it runs rather than
    discovered as a growing lag.  A caller holding a PRICE rather than a
    stopwatch reading passes ``estimated`` and the record carries that
    word, because a refusal resting on a projection is still worth
    raising and nobody reading the record should have to guess which of
    the two they are looking at.  This is the whole of the difference:
    the arithmetic, the policies and the wording are identical.

    Three policies, and there is deliberately no fourth that drops a
    volume quietly:

    ``refuse``
        Fail closed.  The default, because a nowcast silently falling
        behind real time is worse than one that never started.
    ``skip``
        Keep the cadence real-time by dropping volumes that would start a
        cycle before the previous one finished.  Every dropped volume is
        recorded with its reason, so a thinner analysis always says so.
    ``queue``
        Assimilate every volume and let the analysis lag.  The right
        choice for a replay, where there is no real time to fall behind;
        for a live feed the lag grows without bound and the returned
        record says by how much per cycle.
