"""Initial-condition perturbations for storm-scale ensembles (experimental).

A 30-member ensemble whose members differ only by their random seed is not an
ensemble; it is thirty runs of the same forecast.  Spread has to be *put* into
the initial condition, and it has to be put in at scales the model can carry:
white noise on the grid is annihilated by the first diffusion call, and a
domain-wide offset is a bias, not a perturbation.  This module draws smooth
Gaussian random fields with a prescribed horizontal and vertical correlation
length, tapers them to zero against the lateral boundary so a member's
interior can diverge while its boundary forcing stays the unperturbed one,
and adds them to the prognostic state under hard physical bounds.

Construction
------------
For each field an independent unit-variance white-noise draw ``w`` is filtered
in spectral space by a separable Gaussian kernel

    ``H(k) = exp(-(kx^2 + ky^2) Lh^2 / 4) * exp(-kz^2 Lv^2 / 4)``

so the realized field has the Gaussian correlation ``C(r) = exp(-r^2/2L^2)``
(the autocorrelation of a Gaussian of width ``L/sqrt(2)``).  Its *radially
binned* power spectrum, which carries the ``2 pi k`` annulus Jacobian, is
therefore ``E(k) ~ k exp(-k^2 Lh^2 / 2)`` and peaks at ``k = 1/Lh`` exactly.
That peak is the module's contract with :func:`radial_power_spectrum` and is
what ``tests/test_da_perturb.py`` measures; a spectrum that peaks somewhere
else means the prescribed length scale is not the length scale you got.

Amplitudes are normalized *analytically*, not by dividing out the sample
standard deviation.  With unit-variance white noise and NumPy's DFT
convention the field variance is exactly ``mean_k |H(k)|^2``, and because
``H`` is separable that mean is a product of three cheap 1-D means.  Dividing
by the sample standard deviation would force every member to the same
realized variance, which is wrong: sample variance is supposed to fluctuate
between members.  The realized RMS of each draw is recorded in the provenance
instead.

What this does NOT do (v1, stated plainly)
------------------------------------------
* **No mass balance.**  ``mu'`` is untouched and the perturbed state is not
  re-balanced hydrostatically.  The perturbations are added to ``theta'`` and
  the moisture field directly; the column mass they imply is not imposed.
* **No wind balance.**  The ``u``/``v`` perturbations are not divergence-free
  and are not in gradient-wind or geostrophic balance with the temperature
  perturbation.  Expect the first minutes of the forecast to radiate gravity
  waves while the model adjusts.  For storm-scale ensembles with a short
  spin-up this is the accepted cost of a simple, auditable perturbation; a
  balanced route (a streamfunction/velocity-potential control vector, or a
  digital filter over the first steps) is future work.
* **No perturbation of the boundary forcing.**  Members share one boundary
  file.  The rim taper is what keeps that legal; it does not make the members
  independent out to the boundary, and it means ensemble spread decays toward
  the rim by construction.  :func:`recycled_difference_perturbations` and
  :func:`perturbed_lateral_boundaries` are documented stubs, not code.
* **No perturbation of surface, soil, or physics parameters**, and no
  perturbation of ``w`` or ``mu'``.
* **No vertical taper.**  Perturbations reach the model top and the surface
  at full amplitude; only the lateral rim is tapered.
* **No flow dependence.**  The correlation length is prescribed and uniform,
  not derived from the analysis error covariance of the day.
* **The draw is periodic, because the FFT is, and the vertical wrap is NOT
  controlled.**  Opposite edges of the raw field are correlated.
  Horizontally the rim taper hides it completely -- both edges are
  multiplied by zero.  Vertically nothing hides it, and the quarter-column
  cap on ``vertical_scale_levels`` does not fix it: on a periodic column
  level ``0`` and level ``nz-1`` are ONE grid interval apart, not ``nz/2``,
  so their correlation is about ``exp(-1 / (2 Lv^2))`` -- which at the
  admitted cap (``nz=24``, ``Lv=6``) is ``0.983``, essentially locked
  together, and was previously documented as ``exp(-2) ~ 0.14``.  That
  claim confused the maximum circular separation with the seam and was
  simply wrong.  What the cap does control is the mid-column correlation,
  and even there periodic image covariance keeps it above the Gaussian
  value (measured ``0.297`` against a claimed ``0.135``).  Every draw with
  a nonzero vertical scale now reports its exact seam and half-column
  correlations in ``provenance["fields"][i]["vertical_wrap"]``, computed
  from the filter that was actually used; read them before interpreting
  any top-versus-bottom spread.

Multiplicative perturbations, and why the hydrometeors get them
--------------------------------------------------------------
An *additive* Gaussian increment is the wrong instrument for a mixing
ratio.  It is unbounded below, so it manufactures negative mass that has
to be clipped (which adds mass, wetward, everywhere it fires); it is
unbounded above in a variable that spans six orders of magnitude between
cirrus and a hail core, so one amplitude is either meaningless aloft or
absurd in the core; and for a two-moment scheme it breaks the pair --
moving ``qr`` while leaving ``nr`` produces exactly the ``q > 0, N = 0``
cell whose slope closure evaluates to NaN (see :mod:`woof.da.moments`).

So a hydrometeor species is perturbed **multiplicatively**, by a
lognormal factor drawn from the same smooth spectrum as everything else:

    ``f = exp(sigma_ln * clip(g, -k, +k) * taper)``,  ``g`` unit-variance,

and that ONE factor multiplies every prognostic moment of the species --
mass, number, and NSSL's predicted volume.  Four properties follow, and
each is a property rather than a hope:

* **Positivity is exact, with no clipping.**  ``f > 0`` for any finite
  exponent, so ``q >= 0`` implies ``q f >= 0`` in IEEE arithmetic.  No
  mass is added and none is removed by a repair, because there is no
  repair.
* **Moment consistency is exact.**  ``q`` and ``N`` are scaled by the
  same number, so ``q > 0 <=> q f > 0`` and ``N > 0 <=> N f > 0``: the
  perturbation cannot create a depleted pair.  It is applied only where
  the background pair is *jointly* active (``q`` above the scheme's own
  activity threshold AND ``N > 0``), which closes the one remaining
  route -- a background cell already holding ``q > 0`` with ``N = 0``
  below the threshold, which scaling up would have promoted into an
  offender.
* **The drop size distribution is preserved.**  Morrison's slope is
  ``lam = (six_c N / q)^(1/3)``; the ratio ``q/N`` is invariant under a
  common factor, so ``lam`` -- and with it the mean-mass diameter and
  the scheme's own size-dependent process rates -- is exactly unchanged.
  What moves is the number density, and therefore ``Z``, by
  ``10 log10 f`` dB.  A perturbation that moved ``q`` alone would move
  the particle *size*, which is a much stronger and much less defensible
  claim about what the background got wrong.
* **Clear air stays clear.**  Where the species is absent the factor is
  never applied, so the ensemble does not invent storms the model never
  made.  That is a real limitation as well as a virtue and it is stated
  in the provenance: the filter can move echo that exists and cannot
  create echo that does not.

``sigma_ln`` is a *fractional* amplitude: 0.7 is a factor of two at one
sigma and about 3 dB of reflectivity spread, which is the order of a
storm-scale hydrometeor uncertainty.  ``clip_sigmas`` bounds the tail so
no member gets a factor of a thousand from a three-in-a-million draw.

The same mode is available for ``qv`` through
``FieldPerturbation(mode="lognormal")``, for the second reason above:
one additive amplitude cannot be right for a 15 g/kg boundary layer and
a 0.01 g/kg upper troposphere at once, and a fractional one is.
Signed fields refuse the mode outright -- a lognormal factor on a
quantity that changes sign is not a perturbation, it is a bug.

Nothing here is on a certified forecast path.  Every provenance dict this
module returns carries ``status="experimental"``.

class PerturbationConfig:
    """Everything :func:`apply_perturbations` needs besides the state+seed.

    ``rim_width`` is in grid cells and must be at least 1: there is no way to
    ask this module to perturb the outermost row, because a member whose
    boundary row disagrees with the shared boundary file is a member with a
    discontinuity, not a member with spread.

    ``rh_cap`` is the relative-humidity ceiling the perturbed moisture field
    is clipped to (``1.0`` = no supersaturation).  ``None`` disables the cap
    entirely, which also removes the module's only need for a diagnosed
    pressure -- but only if no ``"t"`` perturbation is requested, since the
    Exner conversion needs pressure too.

    ``fft_host`` forces the spectral filter onto the host even when the
    state is on the device.  Off it is a performance choice; on it is a
    REPRODUCIBILITY one, and it exists because of a specific measurement.
    The white-noise draw is already host-side Philox so ``noise_sha256``
    identifies the perturbation rather than the machine -- but the filter
    was not, and cuFFT and pocketfft round differently: MEASURED on a
    192x160x49 draw at ``length_scale_km = 6``, a CuPy-filtered ``theta``
    increment and a NumPy-filtered one agree to 2.24e-13 relative and to
    ZERO bits.  That is fine for a resident forecast, where both members
    filter the same way, and it is fatal for a STREAMED one, whose domain
    lives in pinned host RAM and therefore filters on the host by
    construction: the two execution modes produced different members from
    the same seed.  With ``fft_host = True`` a resident member and a
    streamed member of the same seed are byte-identical, which is what
    makes the mode a transport rather than a science change.

    and ``K = nz * ny * (nx // 2 + 1)`` its real-FFT spectrum points.

    ``2sK`` each and the kernel ``sK``), the inverse transform (the output
    ``sM`` beside the spectrum, the kernel, cuFFT's copy of its complex
    input and the inverse plan's work area), the normalisation (a second
    ``sM`` beside the first) and the realized RMS (a float64 copy and its
    square, ``16M``).  With ``fft_host`` only the finished field reaches

    This exact signature is the contract the ensemble engine codes against.

    fully identifies the perturbation (seed, per-field amplitudes and scales,
    the SHA-256 of each white-noise draw, the realized statistics, the taper,
    and every bound that fired).

    The state is expected to look like ``woof.core.state.DomainState``:
    ``thp``/``qv`` on mass points ``(nz, ny, nx)``, ``u`` on ``(nz, ny,
    nx+1)``, ``v`` on ``(nz, ny+1, nx)``, backed by either NumPy or CuPy.
    Shapes are checked against each other; a field whose staggering does not
    match the mass grid is an error, not a broadcast.

    Read the module docstring for what balance is **not** imposed.  Nothing
    here re-balances mass or wind, and the members share one boundary file.

    **Caller post-condition.**  ``state.p``/``al``/``alt`` are diagnostics of
    ``(thp, php, mup, qv)``; perturbing ``thp`` and ``qv`` leaves them stale.
    The caller must run ``woof.core.diagnostics.update_diagnostics(state,
    ...)`` before the first step.  This module deliberately does not call it:
    the diagnostic is a CUDA-only path and importing it here would make a
    NumPy-backed perturbation impossible.  The returned provenance records
    the requirement under ``"post_conditions"``.  For the same reason the
    supersaturation cap is evaluated against the pressure *as it stands on
    entry* -- a few-kelvin theta perturbation moves the pressure by well
    under a percent, so the cap is accurate to that, and it is a cap rather
    than an equality anyway.

    **Rim invariant.**  Wherever the taper is exactly zero this call is the
    identity, byte for byte -- including the moisture bounds, which are
    confined to the taper-active region.  A clamp that repaired the rim
    would break exactly the boundary consistency the taper exists to keep.

    Perturbing these fields does not disturb ``setup_fingerprint``
    (``woof.state_serialization_contract``): ``u``/``v``/``thp``/``qv`` are
    serialized arrays, not setup arrays, so a perturbed member still restarts
    against the same base state and boundary tables.
