"""EXPERIMENTAL: the hydrometeor positivity policy the filter refuses to own.

:func:`woof.da.letkf.analyze` returns per-member **increments** and does not
clip them.  That is deliberate and it is right: a Gaussian filter applied to a
bounded, heavily zero-inflated variable will routinely propose a negative
mixing ratio, and the three sane responses -- clip, transform, reject -- are
not equivalent, differ in what they do to mass and to the ensemble's own
spread, and are properly the caller's choice.  A filter that clipped would be
making that choice silently for every caller forever.

So the caller must choose, and this module makes the choice explicit,
bounded, and *counted*.

**What ``clip`` actually does, stated accurately.**  Where ``prior + increment``
would be negative, the increment is replaced by ``-prior`` so the analysis is
exactly ``0``.  That is a change of ``-analysis > 0``: **clipping at zero adds
mass.**  It is not conservative and it is biased in one direction, always
wetward for a mixing ratio.  The bias is small when the filter is well tuned
and large when it is not, which makes the count of clipped points and the
mass added the single most useful diagnostic of whether the analysis is
healthy.  Both go into the receipt, per field, per member.  A cycle whose
clipped mass grows leg over leg is a cycle whose covariances are wrong, and
the manifest should be able to show that without a rerun.

**The alternatives, and why neither is the v1.2 default.**

``anamorphosis``
    Assimilate a transformed variable -- ``log(q + q0)`` or a Gaussian
    anamorphosis against the ensemble's own empirical CDF -- so a negative
    analysis is unrepresentable rather than repaired.  It is the principled
    answer and it is not a policy that can live here: it changes what H(x)
    means, what the observation error means, and what the ensemble spread
    means, so it belongs in the forward operator and the filter's input, not
    in a post-hoc fixup.  The zero-inflation also has to be handled
    explicitly (``log 0`` is not a number and ``q0`` is a tuning knob nobody
    has tuned).
``reject``
    Discard the whole increment at any gridpoint where any constrained field
    would go negative, leaving that column at its background value.  It
    conserves the background exactly and adds no mass, but it introduces
    discontinuities between a rejected gridpoint and its analysed neighbour
    -- the model then has to absorb a gradient the filter invented -- and it
    throws away the correction to *unconstrained* fields at that point, which
    were not the problem.  Implemented here, because it is four lines and the
    comparison is worth being able to run; not the default.

Nothing here is wired into a default route.
