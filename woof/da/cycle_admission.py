"""The prepared DA cycle's fit decision, taken once before its first upload.

A cycle runs its trajectories one after another on one card: each is a
whole forecast (the restored state, its physics, the lateral boundary
intervals the prepared cache holds and, on a nesting trajectory, a child
with its own state, physics and scratch), and the leg's model-grid
reflectivity observations stay on the card beside it.  A fresh ensemble's
first leg also perturbs each member on the card before it steps.  Nothing
priced that before :func:`woof.ingest.prepared_cache.restore_prepared_cache`
allocated the first state, so a domain the card could not hold ran out of
memory inside the restore, the physics or the first member's perturbation,
after the preflight had reported the case sound.

The decision prices the LARGEST trajectory once and every trajectory of
every leg runs under it: the members are the same forecast, and the loop
releases each one before the next is wired.

The analysis runs after the leg's trajectories are released, beside the
leg's observations, so it is weighed against the trajectory rather than
added to it.  It is priced by the solver's own sizing
(:func:`woof.da.letkf.analysis_device_price`, which calls the
:func:`woof.da.letkf.chunk_points_for_budget` the solve chooses its chunk
with) on each route the solve can take, in the order it takes them: the
resident route at its configured chunk, the resident route at the
smallest chunk it shrinks to, and the host-staged fallback it retries on
when the resident route runs out of memory.  The first route whose
envelope fits the card is the one admitted and recorded; a card that
holds none of them is refused.
