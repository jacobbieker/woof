"""Radar latent heating on the device: the tendency builder and the forcing.

What this is
------------
HRRR does not only analyse radar reflectivity, it heats the model with it.
A stand-alone program turns observed three-dimensional reflectivity and a
model background into a potential-temperature tendency, four times over the
hour before a forecast, and the model then uses that tendency IN PLACE OF the
microphysics heating wherever the radar has coverage.  Where the radar saw
echo the model is heated as a storm of that strength would heat it; where the
radar looked and saw nothing the tendency is zero, so latent heating is
withheld from a storm the model made up; where the radar has no coverage the
model's own microphysics heats as usual.

This module is that pair on the GPU, for the research data assimilation line:

* :func:`build_tendency` is the builder.  It follows NOAA's subroutines
  statement by statement and is graded against them compiled unchanged
  (``tools/radar_tten_oracle``).
* :class:`RadarTtenForcing` is the model side.  ``woof.core.microphysics
  .apply`` reads one optional attribute off the state; with a forcing there,
  theta takes ``tendency * dt`` in place of the microphysics increment on
  covered points and the microphysics increment everywhere else.

Source, and what "the same" means
---------------------------------
NOAA-EMC/HRRR at tag ``v4.1.21``.  File names below are relative to
``sorc/hrrr_ref2tten.fd/`` unless they name the model.

* ``pbl_height.f90``: the boundary-layer top as a fractional level index
  from virtual potential temperature, in single precision.
* ``build_missing_REFcone.f90``: fills the radar's cone of silence from a
  tabulated profile (the season is fixed to summer, ``:163``) and sets every
  level up to the boundary-layer top to no coverage (``:239-241``).
* ``radar_ref2tten.f90``: the probable-convection test (``:143-162``), the
  tendency (``:177-217``), two smoothing passes (``:219-222``), no coverage
  restored after smoothing (``:227-234``), three more passes and the column
  flag (``:236-309``), stratiform columns handed back to the model
  (``:315-328``) and the final sentinel (``:340-346``).
* ``smooth.f90``: a nine-point stencil on the unsmoothed field for the
  interior, then the four edges updated in place in sequence, so each edge
  is a recurrence along itself.
* ``gsdcloudanalysis_ref2tten.f90``: the driver whose constants are the
  defaults of :class:`RadarTtenConfig` (``:159-162``) and whose slot times
  are 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes (``:438-441``).
* ``sorc/hrrr_wrfarw.fd/WRFV3.9/dyn_em/module_big_step_utilities_em.F``:
  the slot choice (``:5913-5938``) and the application (``:5991-6005``).

Precision matches NOAA's: inputs and the output are float32, the tendency
is float64 inside the builder, and every arithmetic node is one
round-to-nearest operation with no fused multiply-add, which is what
gfortran emits with ``-ffp-contract=off``.  The two powers go through the
tree's own transcription of glibc's binary64 ``pow``
(``woof/core/kernels/glibc_flt64.cuh``), because CUDA's is not the same
function.

Values in the reflectivity array (NOAA's convention, kept)
---------------------------------------------------------
``>= 0.001`` dBZ is echo; ``-99`` is "the radar looked and found nothing";
``-99999`` is no coverage.  :func:`reflectivity_from_document` builds that
array from a ``gpuwm-obs.radar-grid`` document on the device.

Values in a tendency slot (NOAA's convention, kept)
---------------------------------------------------
Levels below the top hold K/s, or ``-20`` for no coverage.  The TOP level
is not a tendency: it holds a two-dimensional flag, ``-10`` no information,
``0`` no convection, ``1`` convection nearby.  A slot has exactly the shape
and values of ``RAD_TTEN_DFI_1..4`` in a NOAA start file, so those four
fields attach unchanged through :meth:`RadarTtenForcing.from_fields`.

``vinterp_radar_ref.f90`` (the mosaic's fixed heights to model levels) is
ported as :func:`vinterp_mosaic` for a three-dimensional mosaic input; the
radar grid files this line reads today are already on model levels and do
not need it.

The companion clamp
-------------------
HRRR never runs ``mp_tend_radar = 1`` alone: the same namelist sets
``mp_tend_lim = 0.07`` K/s (``parm/conus/hrrr_wrfpre.nl:108-109``; the
HRRRDAS members carry the same value, ``parm/hrrrdas/hrrrdas_wrf.nl:102``).
WRF clamps the microphysics increment to ``+/- mp_tend_lim * dt`` before the
radar select (``module_big_step_utilities_em.F:5968-5969``), so the clamp
bounds the heating of every point the radar does not cover and the stored
rate ``h_diabatic`` everywhere (``:6014``), and never the radar tendency.
A forcing therefore runs its microphysics with
:data:`HRRR_MP_TEND_LIM` in place of the case's clamp, by default, and its
receipt records both values.

Where this sits against HRRR's own arrangement (a declared divergence)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In HRRR only the deterministic pre-forecast is forced
(``parm/conus/hrrr_wrfpre.nl:109``); the HRRRDAS ensemble members run
``mp_tend_radar = 0`` (``parm/hrrrdas/hrrrdas_wrf.nl:101``) and the free
forecast does too (``parm/conus/hrrr_wrf.nl:108``).  The research cycle
(``tools/da_cycle_prepared.py --radar-tten``) has no analysed deterministic
member yet, so it forces the ENSEMBLE members, the reverse of HRRR.  Two
consequences follow and are measured, not assumed
(``tools/radar_tten_proof/spread.py``): each observation is used twice
inside the ensemble (to force the members, then by the filter at the end
of the leg against the same file), and the members receive nearly the
same heating where the radar covers, which shrinks their spread there.

What is deliberately not here
-----------------------------
No NumPy implementation and no host fallback: without a CUDA device the
builder refuses.  A second implementation would be a second authority for
the same numbers.  The lightning proxy (``convert_lghtn2ref``) is not
ported because the tree has no lightning reader.
