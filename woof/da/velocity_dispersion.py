"""The radial-velocity dispersion gate.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS
--------------------------
Radial velocity updates theta and vapour through the ensemble's
cross-covariances.  Where the ensemble is under-dispersed in Vr (its
innovations far larger than its spread and the observation error explain),
those covariances are noise with a large gain, and the analysis writes
that noise into the thermodynamics.  On a storm-scale four-minute cycle (a
3 km parent and a 1 km child, one radar) the first analysis, where the
spun-up ensemble first meets the radar, put 6.44 Mt of vapour into one
box of the child in which a run with Vr kept off theta and vapour removed
0.64 Mt, and the model built storms there that no radar saw.  Keeping Vr
off theta and vapour everywhere removed the dump but starved the cycled
storm (footprint rain 0.083 against 0.396 with Vr on both).  So Vr is
withheld from theta and vapour only where its own ensemble cannot explain
its innovations.

THE RULE
--------
Per radial-velocity batch and per column of the domain: the ratio ``sum w
d^2 / sum w (ensemble variance + observation error variance)`` over the
gates of the columns within the batch's horizontal cutoff (``d`` the
innovation against the ensemble-mean H(x), ``w`` the Gaspari-Cohn weight at
the grid's nominal spacing, every level; 1 for an ensemble whose spread and
error explain its innovations).  In a batch whose ratio over ALL its gates
exceeds :data:`DEFAULT_VELOCITY_DISPERSION_BATCH_RATIO`, a column whose
ratio exceeds :data:`DEFAULT_VELOCITY_DISPERSION_RATIO` withholds that
batch from :data:`VELOCITY_DISPERSION_FIELDS` at every level
(:class:`DispersionGate`).  :func:`withhold` then solves those fields again
without the withheld batches and takes them from that solve in the
withheld columns only; every other field and column is the joint solve's.
The columns are split by which gates hold there, with no limit on the
number of gated batches (a continental network gates one batch per radar
at its first analysis), and each of those solves is cut to the box around
its own columns and the observations within their reach, so it costs what
its columns cost and not what the domain does.

Every analysis records the ratio distribution per batch, gate on or off
(:func:`velocity_dispersion`'s receipt), so the thresholds keep being
checked against the cycles that run them.
