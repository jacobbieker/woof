"""A fine one-way nest over the whole radar-DA nowcast.

WHY THIS EXISTS.  The nowcast assimilates and forecasts on a single
coarse domain.  Interpolating its final output to a finer mesh produces
an unbalanced field that spends its first 15--30 minutes adjusting --
exactly the window a nowcast exists to serve.  This module runs a real
one-way nest over EVERY leg instead, observed and free (:func:`nest_legs`):
the child crosses each leg boundary inside its trajectory's restart set
(the tree checkpoint ``woof run --restart`` reads) and is corrected by
the parent's analysis carried down as an increment, so the fine field is
produced by the model rather than by a resampler, and takes lateral
forcing from the parent at every parent step throughout.

WHAT THE CODE PERMITTED, STATED PLAINLY.  woof has three ways to give a
run a child domain and none of them is "introduce a nest mid-run":

* the whole-run live nest (``build_experiment`` initialises every child
  eagerly at t=0) is the proven path, but it would carry the nest through
  the DA cycling as well;
* the delayed per-domain ``start_time`` hook (``on_domain_start``) is
  implemented, but it activates a child by calling ``initialize_child``,
  which resolves its source snapshot at the child's own start time
  (``woof.ingest.nest_init._initial_snapshot``).  That COLD-STARTS the
  nest from the raw analysis valid at the free-forecast start.  Every
  radar increment the cycling bought would live only in the parent and
  reach the nest through its lateral boundaries alone -- strictly worse
  than the post-hoc interpolation this work replaces, because it also
  discards the assimilation;
* ``woof downscale`` / the offline child inherits the parent's evolved
  state, but forces the child from archived HISTORY frames rather than
  every parent step, which is the specific weakness being avoided.

None of those is used.  The route taken is the one the DA driver's own
shape makes available: ``tools/da_cycle_prepared.py`` rebuilds the entire
model from scratch at every leg and joins legs through the restart owner
(``woof.io.restart``: every trajectory writes its tree checkpoint set at
a leg's end and the next leg restores it before the analysis is applied),
so a leg is a restarted model whose clocks the checkpoint places.  A
nested leg is therefore not a mid-run introduction at all -- it is an
ordinary two-domain model resumed at a leg boundary, whose parent state
at the start of that leg is the ANALYSED state.  On the leg a child is
born it is built from that parent by full SINT
(:func:`woof.ingest.nest_init.parent_only_init`), so it inherits every
increment the cycling produced, and is then forced laterally by the
parent every parent step for the rest of the leg; on every later leg it
is restored from the trajectory's own set, and its birth is the
activation epoch the checkpoint header carries (:func:`child_born_at`).

WHAT THAT COSTS, ALSO PLAINLY.  ``parent_only_init`` is the idealized
``input_from_file=F`` branch: it returns ``static_fields=None`` and
``soil=None``, and ``woof.runtime.prepare_child_case`` refuses a
full-physics child without them.  The nowcast profile runs Noah, MM5
surface layer and YSU, so a land state is mandatory.  This module supplies
it by replicating the parent's land column onto the child with WRF's own
nest-down nearest-donor mapping (``interp_fcni``/``interp_fcnm``,
interp_fcn.F), which is the same donor arithmetic
:class:`woof.core.nest_interp.NestRegistration` already builds for SINT.

The consequence is a terrain and land-state policy identical to the one
the offline-child contract already registers as
``sint-parent-inherited``: the fine domain runs the PARENT's terrain
(SINT-interpolated) and the PARENT's land categories, soil and snow
(nearest-donor replicated).  **The nest refines the atmosphere, not the
surface.**  It buys finer dynamics, finer microphysics and a shorter
acoustic step over the analysed storm; it does not buy fine orography,
because on this route no fine static data exists to buy it with.  A
caller who wants fine orography needs a per-domain prepared cache and the
real-data child initialiser, which is a different (and much larger) piece
of work -- and which reopens the balance problem, because real fine
terrain under a SINT-inherited atmosphere is precisely the mismatch WRF's
``blend_terrain``/``adjust_tempqv``/``press_adj`` sequence exists to
repair.

Keeping terrain, base state and land all SINT/nearest of the same parent
is what makes the child's initial state BALANCED: the same linear
operator is applied to the base state and to the prognostic perturbations
that are defined against it, so the child starts in the same hydrostatic
and mass balance the parent was in.  That is the whole point of the
exercise.

ONE-WAY ONLY.  ``feedback`` is pinned to 0 here and the assembled tree is
checked for it.  The parent cannot be altered by the presence of the
child, and ``tests/test_da_nested_forecast_gpu.py`` holds that as a
bitwise ratchet in the same spirit as the N3/N4/N5 ancestor-inertness
gates.

Nothing here is on a default route.  EXPERIMENTAL.
