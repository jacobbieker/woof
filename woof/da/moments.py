"""EXPERIMENTAL (WOOF v1.2): what a multi-moment scheme's analysis must be.

A two-moment microphysics scheme's state is PAIRS.  ``qr`` without ``nr``
is not a rain field with a missing diagnostic; it is not a rain field at
all -- the scheme's own slope closure reads both, and the pair is what
carries the drop size distribution.  An analysis that updates one member
of the pair and not the other produces a state the scheme cannot
evaluate.

This is not hypothetical.  A rung-2 real-radar LETKF cycle ran with

    ANALYSIS_FIELDS = ('thp','qv','u','v','qc','qr','qi','qs','qg')

on a Morrison (``mp_physics=10``) state.  Nine fields, no number
concentrations.  Reflectivity assimilation created hydrometeor mass in
cells the background had left clear, so the analysis held ``q`` up to
6.4 g/kg with ``N`` still at the background's exact zero -- for one
member, **100%** of the in-mask offenders were background-clear cells:
21 332 rain, 37 592 snow, 27 548 graupel.  Morrison's slope math then
does what it accurately must:

    lam = (six_c * N / q)**(1/3)  ->  0
    ilam = 1/lam                  ->  +inf
    n0  = N * ... * lam**e        ->  0
    Ze  = n0 * ... * ilam**e      ->  0 * inf = nan

and the reflectivity operator retains the NaN rather than letting a
corrupt state masquerade as its -35 dBZ clear-air floor
(``woof.verify.npref`` :9231-9239).  The operator was right.  The
ANALYSIS STATE was unphysical, and reflectivity OmA was unrecoverable
for that cycle.

That field list lived in a work script, but a product that lets a work
script do this has the defect.  So:

**Part 1 -- the state vector is derived from the scheme, never typed
out.**  :func:`analysis_fields` builds the update list from the selected
scheme's own prognostic moment set (``woof.core.nssl2_contract`` for
NSSL, the Registry-derived pairs below for the rest), and
:func:`validate_analysis_fields` refuses a list that moves a mass field
while leaving a paired number moment the state actually carries
untouched.  A caller that genuinely wants a single-moment update must say
so -- ``policy="single-moment-with-repair"`` -- and that policy REQUIRES
the guard below, because it is the policy that creates the offenders.

**Part 2 -- the guard, after any update.**  :func:`moment_consistency_report`
counts cells where a mass field is above the scheme's own activity
threshold and its paired number moment is at or below zero.
:func:`repair_moments` fixes them **using the scheme's own authority**,
not an invented intercept: for Morrison that is the PSD limiter at
``module_mp_morr_two_moment.F:1525-1638``, invoked here through its
float64 mirror ``woof.verify.npref._np_morrison_slopes``.  Given
``q > 0`` and ``N = 0`` that limiter computes ``lam = 0``, clamps it to
the species' own lower bound ``lam_min``, and back-computes
``N = q * lam_min**3 / six_c`` -- the largest-particle limit, which is
exactly what the scheme would impose at the first step of the next leg.
The repair is therefore not a new closure; it is the state the scheme
was going to bound the analysis to anyway, applied before the
reflectivity operator is asked about it.

Thompson (8 and 28) has the same kind of authority and it is a better
one, because the scheme states it for exactly this case: the entry block
of ``mp_thompson`` (``module_mp_thompson.F:1827-1899``) walks every
column before any process rate is computed and, where a species has mass
and no number, SETS the number from the mass under the scheme's own
assumed distribution -- a 100 um droplet, a 5 um crystal capped at
999e3 m^-3, a 1 mm median volume drop.  That block runs on the analysis
at the first step of the next leg whatever this module does, so applying
it here changes only WHEN the state becomes one the scheme can evaluate,
not what it becomes.  It reaches this module through its host mirror
:mod:`woof.core.thompson_entry`.

The same block is the authority for the reverse case, which Morrison's
limiter has nothing to say about: a cell the increment left with a
number moment and no mass is zeroed in both moments (:1844-1848,
:1871-1875, :1900-1904).  That state is not a NaN risk and it is NOT
counted against ``consistent`` -- it never was, and a new refusal needs
a breakage to name -- but where the repair runs it is repaired, and the
receipt counts it separately from the depleted pairs.

**Where a scheme's repair authority is not ported, there is no repair.**
NSSL (18) sets number from mass through its own fixed intercepts in
``module_mp_nssl_2mom.F``; that routine is not in this tree, and
inventing an intercept would be tuning science.  NSSL therefore DETECTS
and REFUSES.  A refusal naming 27 548 graupel cells is a usable result;
a number produced by a made-up intercept is not.

Nothing here is wired into a default route, and nothing here changes a
filter: the LETKF still returns increments and still owns no policy.

    Only OFFENDING cells are written.  The limiter would rebound every
    active cell's number -- that is what the scheme does at its first
    step -- but a data-assimilation repair that quietly rewrote healthy
    moments would be a second analysis nobody asked for, and it would be
    invisible in the receipt.  So the scheme's bounded number is taken,
    and applied where and only where the pair was broken.

    Refuses when the scheme has no ported repair authority: NSSL's
    intercept-based number initialisation is not in this tree, and a
    number invented here would be a tuning decision wearing a repair's
    clothes.

    Refuses BEFORE that, and for every scheme, when any moment is not
    finite where the scheme reads it.  A repair is a limiter evaluated on
    the state; a limiter evaluated on NaN returns NaN, so "repairing" a
    non-finite pair would replace one unevaluable state with another and
    stamp the receipt ``repaired``.
