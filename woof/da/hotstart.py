"""EXPERIMENTAL (WOOF v1.2): rung-1 DA -- reflectivity nudging.

Latent-heat insertion, the cheapest useful thing you can do with a radar
volume: where the observations show an echo the model has not built,
warm the observed-echo column a bounded amount and moisten it toward a
target relative humidity, so the next few minutes of integration spin up
convection in the right place instead of the wrong one.  Optionally --
OFF by default -- do the reverse where the model has an echo and the
observations are clear.

This is not a filter.  It has no error covariance, no observation
weighting, no analysis increment in any statistical sense, and it will
happily create energy.  It is a nudge, and it is bounded so that a bad
observation degrades the forecast rather than destroying it.  The real
analysis is the EnKF lane's job; this is the rung below.

Everything is a pure function of ``(state, z_obs, z_mask, cfg)``: no
RNG, no clock, no filesystem, no global state, no ordering dependence.
Two calls on equal inputs return bitwise-equal increments.

The caller applies the increments; this module never mutates the state.
The returned field keys name state attributes:

- ``"thp"`` -- perturbation potential temperature (K).  The base state
  ``thb`` is time-invariant, so an increment to theta IS an increment to
  ``thp``; add it to ``state.thp``.
- ``"qv"`` -- water vapour mixing ratio (kg/kg).

Nothing here is wired into any default route.

EXPERIMENTAL.  Not covered by the v1 stability promise.

    beam-blocked cells must be False, and no increment is ever produced
    where the mask is False.  Both are the ``gpuwm-obs.radar-grid.v1``
    gridded arrays.

    ``z_obs`` is capped at ``cfg.max_insertion_dbz`` (55 dBZ by default)
    before the deficit is formed -- an invariant of this function, not a
    convention the caller is trusted with.  The cap and the number of
    cells it bound are recorded in the provenance.

    ``cfg`` is the :class:`HotStartConfig`.  The simulated reflectivity
    comes from ``simulated_dbz=`` (preferred -- the caller usually has it
    already) or is computed from ``run_cfg=`` via the bound Z operator;
    supplying neither raises rather than assuming clear air.

    ``applied`` chooses the cap semantics, and the choice is explicit
    because it has to be.  Every cap here is applied to THIS call's
    increment.  Since the nudge changes ``thp``/``qv`` but not the
    hydrometeors that dominate simulated Z, a persistent reflectivity
    deficit is not removed by applying the increment, so calling again on
    the updated state re-fires the warm branch and adds another full
    increment: n applications reach n times the cap.

    - ``applied=None`` (default): the caps are PER INVOCATION.  The caller
      is responsible for applying the increment at most once per analysis
      time, or for accepting per-cycle tendencies.
    - ``applied={"thp": array, "qv": array}``: the cumulative increment
      already inserted at this analysis time.  The returned increment is
      then clamped so ``applied + increment`` stays within the configured
      ``[-decrement, +increment]`` caps, making them TOTAL analysis-time
      bounds.  Thread it across repeated applications (accumulating it
      yourself) and the totals cannot exceed the caps however many times
      you apply.

    Returns :class:`HotStartResult`.  Cells that fail any test get
    exactly ``0.0``, so a forecast that already matches the observations
    produces bitwise-zero increments and applying them is a no-op.

    Non-finite ``z_obs`` or ``simulated_dbz`` never produces an
    increment: every gate is a comparison, and comparisons against NaN
