"""EXPERIMENTAL: ``gpuwm-obs.radar-grid.v1`` -> LETKF observation batches.

The radar lane writes the file; :mod:`woof.da.letkf` consumes
:class:`~woof.da.letkf.GriddedObs`.  Neither lane owns the translation, and
the translation is where the two schemas actually differ, so it lives here.

Three properties of the file are essential and are the reason this is a
module rather than four lines at a call site.

**Radial velocity carries a leading radar axis, and it must survive.**
``vr_obs`` is ``(radar, level, south_north, west_east)``.  Two radars looking
at one cell measure two different projections of one wind; their mean is a
number with no observation operator behind it, and dropping one throws away
half the information.  Each radar therefore becomes its **own**
:class:`GriddedObs`, named ``vr:<SITE>``.  The filter batches observation
types independently and localises each on its own, so N radars is N entries in
the ``obs`` sequence and nothing else changes.

**The beam unit vectors are the observation operator direction.**
``vr_beam_east/north/up`` ship with every retained velocity precisely so that
the assimilating side does not re-derive beam geometry from the radar position
and the cell centre -- duplicated work, and a place for the two stages to
disagree about where a cell is.  :func:`simulated_radial_velocity` projects a
member's earth-relative wind onto **the file's own vectors**.  It deliberately
does not call :func:`woof.da.obsop.beam_geometry`: that function evaluates
the beam exactly at the mass point, while the file's vectors are the
normalised sum over the gates that actually contributed to the superob cell.
Those agree only to within a superob cell, and the observation's own geometry
is the one an innovation must be taken against.

**The grid is bound by its arrays, not by its name.**  Every entry point
here takes the caller's own :class:`~woof.obs.target_grid.TargetGrid` and
recomputes the digest table the writer bound to the file, ``z_w`` included.
``grid_identity_sha256`` on its own cannot do that job: it digests the
projection's definition, ``z_w`` and ``terrain_m`` at float64, while the
file stores the coordinates and terrain at float32 and no vertical
coordinate at all.  A file whose
identity attribute has been relabelled to name a different grid passes
every check a reader can make by itself, and assimilating it puts every
observation in the wrong column.  So the string is accepted only as an
extra demand to cross-check, never as the binding.

**Observation errors are standard deviations.**  ``z_err`` and ``vr_err`` are
``sqrt(base^2/n + in-cell variance)`` with a floor -- already a sigma.  The
filter's contract is also a sigma.  Nothing is squared here, and a
non-positive error under a True mask is a refusal rather than a quietly
dropped point.

Nothing in this module is wired into a default route.

#: could not tell clear sky from ambiguity -- but not in kind, and both take
#: the same ``z0_err`` and the same forward-operator floor.

    The whole 3-D georeference goes across, because all of it is already on
    the file and every reduction of it is a lie the filter cannot detect:

    * **layer-midpoint heights per column**, ``(nz, ny, nx)``, the same
      midpoint reduction of ``z_w`` the observation operator uses.  A single
      representative column -- the domain mean, say -- reports one height
      per level, so every same-level pair is zero metres apart vertically
      and takes a vertical localisation weight of exactly 1 no matter what
      the terrain between them does.  Over a ridge that is not a small
      approximation: 2 km of relief under a 4 km cutoff is the difference
      between a weight of 1 and Gaspari-Cohn's 5/24.
    * **mass-point latitude/longitude**, so horizontal separation is a
      geodesic.  ``dx_m`` is the projection's nominal spacing; the physical
      spacing on a conformal projection is ``dx/mapfac``, and a fixed radius
      in metres therefore reaches a different number of columns depending on
      where the domain sits relative to the standard parallels.

    ``dx_m``/``dy_m`` still go across as well: they are what sizes the
    horizontal stencil in the degenerate no-coordinates case, and they are
    part of the grid's identity.
