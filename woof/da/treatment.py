"""Did the treatment actually run?

Five A/B screens in this project's history were declared, executed, scored
and reported before anyone noticed that the flag under test had never been
set.  The arms were byte-identical; the deltas were exactly 0.0; the
conclusions were void.  The failure was never in the science, and it was
never visible in the run's own output -- a run with a stream switched on
and a run with that stream silently contributing nothing produced the same
receipt, so nothing could tell them apart after the fact.

This module makes that indistinguishability impossible.  It has two jobs.

**Count what was assimilated, per observation type, per cycle.**  The
count is taken from the batches the filter actually solved, at the one
point where every type is present in one list, and it is keyed by the
adapters' own ``kind`` discriminators rather than by which flags were on.
"Reflectivity was enabled" and "reflectivity contributed 14,203
observations" are different claims and only the second is evidence.

**Refuse to call the run full-stack when an enabled stream contributed
nothing.**  Not a warning, not a downgrade to a smaller label: a refusal.
A stream that assimilated zero observations across the opening cycles is
either misconfigured or being fed files that do not cover the domain, and
in both cases the accurate outcome is a stopped run and a message naming the
stream -- not six hours of card time producing a result whose headline
would be a lie.  Two cycles rather than one because a single cycle can
legitimately miss a satellite granule or a radar volume; a stream that is
genuinely live shows up in one of the first two.

The refusal is deliberately not symmetric with the enable flags.  Turning
a stream ON is a claim that it will contribute, and this module holds the
claim to account.  Leaving one off asserts nothing and is never checked.
