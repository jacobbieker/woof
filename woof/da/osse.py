"""OSSE twin experiment: the gate on :mod:`woof.da.letkf`.  EXPERIMENTAL.

An observing-system simulation experiment is the only test that can tell you
a Kalman filter *works*, as opposed to *runs*.  Unit tests on Gaspari-Cohn
values and on CuPy-versus-NumPy agreement check that the pieces do what they
say; they would all pass with a sign error in the innovation, which would
make the filter reliably worse than doing nothing.  The twin experiment
catches that, because it is the only test that knows the truth.

The design is deliberately model-free.  No dycore, no physics, no wrfout: a
truth state is a smoothed Gaussian random field, the prior ensemble is that
truth plus smoothed random error plus a bias, and the observation operator is
supplied here.  That keeps the gate runnable in seconds on any machine, keeps
it from failing for reasons that have nothing to do with the filter, and --
most importantly -- makes the truth *exactly* known, which is what makes the
RMSE numbers mean something.

What the gate asserts (see ``tests/test_letkf_osse.py``):

1. the ensemble-mean RMSE against truth falls, for the observed field;
2. it also falls for fields that are NOT observed, which is the multivariate
   update working through ensemble cross-covariance -- the property that
   distinguishes an EnKF from an optimal interpolation scheme;
3. the ensemble spread falls but stays strictly positive (a filter that
   collapses the spread has stopped being an ensemble);
4. with no observations, the increments are exactly zero -- the no-DA
   control;
5. increments are exactly zero beyond the localisation cutoff.

Two observation operators are provided.  ``"direct"`` observes one state
field pointwise; ``"speed"`` observes ``sqrt(u^2 + v^2)``, which is
genuinely nonlinear and exercises the fact that the filter linearises H
through the ensemble rather than requiring a tangent-linear operator.

Runnable as ``python -m woof.da.osse``.  It is not wired into the woof CLI
and does not read or write any campaign artefact.
