"""``woof enprod`` -- the products that make an ensemble legible.

An ensemble of N members is N wrfout timelines; nobody reads N of
anything.  The WoFS-style suite below collapses them into five pictures
that a forecaster can actually use:

* ``mean``      -- the ensemble mean of a scalar product field.
* ``spread``    -- the ensemble standard deviation (1 sigma, ddof=1):
  where the members disagree.
* ``prob``      -- probability of exceedance at a threshold, optionally
  over a neighborhood of a given radius (max-in-neighborhood per member
  first, THEN the ensemble fraction: the NMEP convention).
* ``paintball`` -- every member's threshold contour on one panel, one
  stable colour per member: the ensemble's spatial envelope with the
  membership still readable.
* ``pmm``       -- the probability-matched mean for reflectivity-like
  fields: the mean's spatial pattern carrying the pooled members'
  intensity distribution, because a plain ensemble mean of reflectivity
  smears every storm into a blob that verifies as nothing.

INPUT is an ensemble root directory: ``member_NNN/`` run directories
holding ordinary wrfouts, plus an ``ensemble-manifest.json`` of schema
``gpuwm-ensemble-manifest.v1`` (see :func:`load_manifest`).  Nothing here
scans for member directories on its own -- the manifest is the roster,
and a member the manifest declares but the disk does not have is a
refusal naming that member, never a quietly smaller ensemble.  A
19-member "30-member" probability field is wrong by 37% and looks
exactly like a right one.

CONVENTIONS are :mod:`woof.render`'s, imported rather than restated:
the domain+resolution filename token (``d02-3km``), the subtitle line
(``d02-3km | dx 3 km | valid ... | WOOF``), the recessive-axes panel,
the NWS 5-dBZ reflectivity scale, and the claims-map refusal that made
v1.0.1 stop silently overwriting one nest's PNG with another's.  On top
of them this module adds the two facts an ensemble product must carry:
the member count, and an EXPERIMENTAL stamp -- these products are new in
v1.2, and none of them has been calibrated against a verification
archive.

Filenames extend the v1.0.1 shape ``{product}_{domain-token}_{stamp}``
by putting an ensemble token in the product slot::

ENGINES: ``--engine`` selects which renderer draws the panels, and the
default is ``auto``, which means the Rust one.  ``rw_ensbatch`` is the
engine this module's docstring used to say did not exist -- the same
reductions (``rustwx-ensemble``, unit-tested against the same probes the
functions below name) on the same production map/basemap/design/PNG path
a deterministic ``woof render --engine rust`` panel comes off.

The matplotlib suite below (:func:`run_suite` and everything it calls) is
therefore the render law's DEPRECATED FALLBACK: reachable, documented,
and NOT the product tier.  ``auto`` does not arrive here at all: it
answers rust or a refusal naming the engine, the build line and the
workaround (:func:`woof.rustwx_lanes.resolve_lane_engine`).  The one
way in is ``--engine matplotlib``, by name, and taking it prints
:func:`woof.rustwx_lanes.ensemble_workaround_notice` on stderr every
run, because an opt-in route is a workaround and says so.  Nothing is
kept here that the Rust route cannot do: ``--domain dNN`` is passed to
the engine as the nest choice and a member directory holding several
nests is refused once, in the same sentence whichever engine was asked
for, and ``--dpi`` is the same picture on both routes, scaled from the
engine's 1200x900 at the default ``--dpi 150`` (:func:`panel_pixels`).
MEASURED 2026-08-17: five real tile-streamed members, all five products

#: What this suite does with a non-finite member value.  ONE policy, named
#: and applied identically by every product, because the two ways it used
#: to be handled implicitly were both wrong in the same direction --
#: quietly:
#:
#: ``"mask"`` (the default) -- MASKED AND COUNTED.  A non-finite value is
#:   not data -- NaN and +/-Inf alike, which is what ``np.isfinite`` means
#:   and what every reduction here uses -- so it is excluded from every
#:   reduction at that grid point
#:   and the DENOMINATOR shrinks with it.  A point where no member is
#:   finite is NaN in the output: there is nothing to say there, and
#:   saying nothing is the answer.  The coverage this leaves is recorded
#:   in the provenance and printed on the panel, which is what answers the
#:   real objection to nan-aware statistics -- not that they exclude
#:   missing members, but that they do it without disclosing the count.
#:
#: ``"refuse"`` -- fail closed.  Any non-finite value anywhere in the
#:   member stack refuses the whole product, naming the members and the
#:   point counts.  For an operational sheet where a silently masked
#:   member is worse than no sheet at all.
#:
#: What is NOT on offer is the old implicit behaviour, where ``NaN >
#: threshold`` evaluated ``False`` and an invalid member was counted as a
#: MISS against the full ensemble denominator.  That understated
#: probability and broke the advertised radius monotonicity outright: a
#: one-member probe of ``[10, NaN, 0]`` at threshold 5 gave ``[1, 0, 0]``
#: at radius 0 and ``[0, 0, 0]`` at radius 1, because ``np.maximum``

#:   That order is deterministic and carries NO information: a four-cell
#:   plateau at mean 1.5 comes back as ``[3, 2, 1, 0]``, which is a
#:   row-major artifact of the tie and not a feature of the forecast.  The
#:   PMM's defining property is that the output's value distribution IS
#:   the pooled members' one, so this is the rule that keeps the product
#:   what it claims to be, and the tie statistics are reported so a reader
#:   can see how much of a panel is plateau.
#:
#: ``"average"`` -- every point in a tie group receives the mean of the
#:   pooled values that group was allotted.  No artificial gradient, at
#:   the cost of the exact pooled distribution (and, on a tied maximum, of
#:   the retained ensemble maximum).  Offered because on a field with a

    * counting a non-finite member as a non-exceedance against the full

      the probe ``[10, NaN, 0]`` at threshold 5 fell from ``1`` at radius
      0 to ``0`` at radius 1;
    * fixing the voting roster to the point rather than to the disc keeps
      the denominator independent of the radius, which is what makes the
      advertised structural monotonicity EXACT rather than approximate.
      A denominator that grew with the radius would let a probability
      fall as the radius rose even with the masking right, and this
      product's one structural promise would still be false.

       entry -- exact contract, canonical member-relative path, a domain
       agreeing with its own filename, non-negative integer size, a real
       sha256 digest, and unique valid frame indices;
    2. no path is declared twice, because every check downstream keys on
       the path and a dict keeps whichever record came last;
    3. every file the manifest declared is present at its declared
       relative path, at its declared size, and hashes to its declared
       sha256 -- the check a stale replacement cannot pass;
    4. every frame the suite indexed comes from a file the manifest
       declared -- so an extra wrfout dropped into the member directory is
       a refusal and not an extra member-time in the mean;
    5. every (valid time -> frame index) pair the suite resolved is the
       pair the manifest recorded for that file, AND every frame declared
       for the indexed domain was resolved -- the two directions together
       are a bijection.  Only the first direction existed, so an inventory
       could declare a frame at index 99 in 2099 that nothing on disk
       carries and still verify: ``declared_frames=2, bound_frames=1``
       was reported as VERIFIED;
    6. at least one declared file supplied at least one indexed frame that
       satisfied all of those checks -- verification is evidence, not the
       vacuous absence of a counterexample in an empty loop;
    7. the declared ``wrfout_count``, where the writer recorded one,
       agrees with the length of the declared inventory.

    The bijection is scoped to the domain the suite INDEXED, because
    :func:`index_member_frames` selects one domain and a member that
    legitimately wrote d01 and d02 histories declares both.  Scoping it
    to the indexed domain is what makes "every declared frame was bound"
    a statement about this product rather than about the run.

    """Bind an overridden member's frames to the manifest's own inventory.

    ``--accept-status`` used to be a byte-level decision: name ``FAILED``
    and the suite recursively globbed ``wrfout*`` under that member's
    directory and averaged whatever it found, without checking the
    top-level manifest status, without binding an inventory, and without
    stamping the override on the graphic.  A stale wrfout from an earlier,
    unrelated attempt went into the mean and the PNG was indistinguishable
    from an all-``DONE`` one.

    The first fix compared the manifest's ``wrfout_count`` with the number
    of files the suite indexed, and that is not an identity either: ONE
    stale file replacing ONE real file passes it exactly.  A focused probe
    put arbitrary bytes behind a single indexed frame, declared
    ``wrfout_count=1``, and the verifier reported the member VERIFIED.

    So the override binds against
    :data:`woof.ensemble.wrfout_inventory.WRFOUT_INVENTORY_CONTRACT` --
    canonical relative path, domain, valid times with their frame indices,
    size and sha256, recorded per file by the writer when the member
    finished.  Every declared file must be present and hash to what was
    recorded; every indexed frame must come from a declared file at the
    declared frame index; nothing undeclared may contribute.

    **A member with no verification evidence is refused, not admitted.**
    A missing inventory used to be reported as "unverifiable" and rendered
    anyway; an explicitly empty inventory later passed vacuously because
    every binding loop had zero iterations.  Both put bytes with no checked
    identity behind a verification-shaped decision.  There is no accurate
    reading of "the roster was widened to include a member whose files
    nothing can identify"; if that member is wanted, the operator can say
    so by producing an inventory that binds at least one indexed frame.
