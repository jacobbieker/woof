"""H_CWP(x): the model's cloud water path, for differencing against GOES.

The satellite sibling of :func:`woof.da.obsop.simulated_reflectivity`, and
built the same way -- it delegates to the model's own definitions rather
than inventing a parallel one, and it says exactly which definitions it
took and why.

## The integral

``CWP(j, i) = 1000 * sum_k q_cond[k,j,i] * (c1h[k]*mu[j,i] + c2h[k])
* (-dnw[k]) / G``, in g m-2.

The measure ``(c1h*mu + c2h)*(-dnw)/G`` is the model's own eta-coordinate
column mass per unit area, taken verbatim from
``woof/verify/cases/moist_bubble.py:125-134`` (``_water_mass``), which is
this project's only pre-existing column water integral and the one its
conservation case is judged against.  It is used here in preference to
``rho_d * dz`` -- ``(1/state.alt) * (z_w[k+1]-z_w[k])`` -- for two
reasons, neither cosmetic:

* It is **exact in the discretisation**.  ``woof/core/kernels/diagnostics.cu``
  defines ``alt[k] = -(ph[k+1]-ph[k]) * rdnw[k] / (c1h[k]*mu + c2h[k])``,
  so ``dz/alt`` and ``(c1h*mu+c2h)*(-dnw)/G`` are the same number up to
  float rounding -- but the mass form telescopes exactly to the column dry
  mass, and the geometric form does not.
* ``alt`` **goes stale**.  ``woof/da/perturb.py:1639`` documents that
  ``p``/``al``/``alt`` are invalid after any state mutation until
  ``update_diagnostics`` reruns.  An observation operator evaluated on a
  perturbed or incremented member would silently use the pre-mutation
  density.  ``c1h``, ``c2h``, ``dnw`` are setup arrays and cannot go stale;
  ``mu`` is ``mub2d + mup`` and ``mup`` is prognostic and serialized.

``G`` is ``woof.core.constants.G`` = 9.81, the constant the measure it
came from uses.  Noted because it is not the only gravity in the tree:
``woof/core/rrtmgp.py:1096`` builds its condensate paths with 9.80665, so
a CWP compared against RRTMGP's ``clwp + ciwp`` differs by 0.035% on this
constant alone.

The ``1000 *`` converts kg m-2 to g m-2, matching
``woof/core/rrtmg_legacy_prep.py:536`` (which also emits g m-2) and the
unit ``gpuwm-obs.goes-cwp.v1`` publishes.

## Which condensate

The retrieval is optical: DCOMP inverts a reflected-radiance pair for
optical depth and effective radius, so the model condensate that
corresponds to it is the condensate the model's own radiation code treats
as optically active.  That definition already exists here, twice, and
agrees with itself:

* ``woof/core/rrtmg_legacy_prep.py:538-539`` -- ``gliqwp`` from ``qc``,
  ``gicewp`` from ``qi + qs``.
* ``woof/core/rrtmgp.py:1097-1098`` -- ``clwp = qc * mass_path``,
  ``ciwp = (qi + qs) * mass_path``.

So liquid is ``qc`` and ice is ``qi + qs``.  **Rain is excluded**, which
is not an omission: ``woof/core/rrtmgp.py:1243`` states that rain never
enters the model's own cloud-fraction condensate, and
``woof/core/refl.py:13`` puts ``qr``/``qs``/``qg`` on the *reflectivity*
side of the split.  Graupel and hail are excluded for the operator spec's
reason: large precipitating ice contributes little optical depth per unit
mass.

### The one place this diverges from `docs/obs-goes-cwp-operator-spec.md`

That spec's v1 rule is ``q_cond = qc + qi`` for an ice-phase observation,
with ``qs`` excluded.  This module's default includes ``qs``, because the
model's own optical definition includes it in both radiation paths, and
because a spec written before the operator was built is a weaker authority
than the code the operator has to be consistent with.  The divergence is
deliberate, it is recorded in every receipt as ``composition``, and the
spec's variant is one argument away -- ``CwpComposition(ice=("qc", "qi"))``.
Which is right is a scoreboard question, exactly as the spec says
("Revisit with the scorecard, not by argument"), and both arms are
reachable without a code change.

## Phase-aware composition

The retrieval's phase is *cloud-top* phase, so the operator cannot
integrate a phase-matched column naively.  Following the spec:

* observed liquid or supercooled liquid: ``qc``.
* observed ice or mixed: ``qc + qi + qs``.  An ice-topped deep column
  hides liquid beneath its top, and comparing model ice alone against a
  retrieval that integrated the whole optical column biases H(x) low.
* observed **clear-sky zero**: ``qc + qi + qs``.  The zero must be able to
  remove any cloud the model invented, whatever its phase; composing a
  clear observation against ``qc`` alone would leave model ice invisible
  to the one observation that most confidently says it should not exist.

The phase used is the **observation's**, never the model's.  That keeps H
a fixed function of the state given the data -- a state-dependent species
selection would make H discontinuous in ``x`` at the phase boundary, and
an ensemble straddling that boundary would produce a covariance the filter
has no right to.
