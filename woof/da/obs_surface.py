"""EXPERIMENTAL: a ``gpuwm-obs.asos-surface`` record (v2, or v1) -> LETKF observation batches.

The obs battery's ``rw_asos`` (BowEcho rustwx, ``tools/rustwx/crates/
rw-obs/src/bin/asos.rs``) owns the decode: it pulls routine + SPECI METARs
from the IEM archive against a frozen, hash-pinned station table, screens
them, converts to SI and writes the seam record this module reads.  Nothing
here parses a METAR, ever -- the decode authority stays in the owner's Rust
stack, and everything this adapter cannot get from the seam is an upstream
(rw-obs) schema extension, not a local workaround.

What the v1 seam can and cannot express, and what that means here:

**Wind is a speed, not a vector.**  IEM's ``drct`` (direction) is fetched by
``rw_asos`` and dropped at decode, so ``wind_speed_10m`` is the only wind
quantity on the seam and u10/v10 innovations cannot be built.  The wind
observation is therefore the SPEED, and its forward operator is
``hypot(u10, v10)`` of each member's own 10 m diagnostics.  The modulus is
rotation-invariant, so grid-relative model winds need no earth rotation --
the one surface operator that is exactly as defensible without the direction
as with it.  Assimilating components needs an ``asos-surface.v2`` carrying
``drct``: upstream work, the owner's call.

**Temperature is the model's own 2 m diagnostic.**  The surface layer
diagnoses ``t2`` every step (MYNN and legacy sfclay both), so H(x) is that
field at the station's gridpoint -- the identity, not a fabricated
similarity-theory inversion on this side of the seam.

**Pressure is deliberately absent.**  The seam's ``mslp`` is IEM's own
reduction and is missing wherever an AWOS reports altimeter only;
differencing it against any model-side reduction mixes two formulas.  The
clean pair (altimeter or station pressure vs ``psfc`` adjusted to station
elevation) needs the v2 schema too, so this adapter does not offer a
pressure type at all rather than offering a wrong one.

**Reports serve one slot each, and are dated to when they were taken.**  The
decoder matches each report to the ONE valid time nearest it (a METAR
record's stride is an hour, ``--step-hours`` in [1, 24]), so a report
serves one slot and a 5-15 min cycling run fed by METARs sees fresh surface
observations at roughly one cycle per hour.
A ``v2`` record carries each report's ``observation_time`` (the archive's
own instant) beside the ``valid_time`` slot it serves; the age of a report
at an analysis, and which analysis it is routed to, are measured from
``observation_time``, while ``valid_time`` stays the slot binding.  A
``v1`` record has only the slot, which then stands as the instant too,
and the adapter counts such reports (``reports_without_observation_time``)
so a receipt says which clock its ages came from.  Each report is
assimilated ONCE, at the analysis nearest its observation time (ties to
the earlier analysis), and never once its age exceeds ``max_age_seconds``.
Sub-hourly cadence is the archive's one-minute ASOS pages: a record decoded
with ``rw_asos --product asos1min`` serves a valid time every minute, each
report the minute it was taken, and the routing above assimilates the one
nearest each analysis, so every analysis of a cycle of a few minutes gets a
report from those stations.

**Station elevation is checked against model terrain.**  A valley or ridge
station the grid does not resolve produces systematic 2 m innovations that
the filter will happily spread into the storm environment.  Stations whose
elevation differs from the model terrain at their gridpoint by more than
``elevation_max_diff_m`` are refused and counted, never silently kept; the
lapse-rate-adjustment alternative is a policy decision that belongs to the
owner, not to a default.

**Errors are standard deviations**, stated by the caller: the v1 record
carries no per-report error, and instrument precision is the wrong number
anyway at storm-scale grids -- WoFS-like representativeness values
(T2 ~ 1.5-2.5 K, wind ~ 1.5-2.5 m/s) are the defensible range.  There is
no default sigma: a number nobody chose is a claim nobody made.

Nothing in this module is wired into a default route.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source
        A ``gpuwm-obs.asos-surface`` record path (v2, or v1) or an already-read record.
    target_grid
        The caller's own :class:`~woof.obs.target_grid.TargetGrid`.
        Placement is its ``mass_index`` and ``inside`` -- the same
        coverage authority the radar path binds to -- and the elevation
        gate reads its ``terrain_m``.
    analysis_time
        The analysis this adaptation serves, UTC (naive = UTC).
    config
        :class:`SurfaceObsConfig`; which quantities run is stated there.
    simulated_t2
        ``(R, ny, nx)`` member 2 m temperature diagnostics, K.  Required
        when temperature is enabled.  Snapshot these at LEG END from the
        live physics driver -- the leg-start diagnostics are re-initialised
        spin-up state in the prepared-cache cycle and must not be used.
    simulated_u10, simulated_v10
        ``(R, ny, nx)`` member 10 m wind diagnostics, m/s, grid-relative.
        Required together when wind speed is enabled; H is their modulus,
        which no grid rotation can change.
    analysis_times
        Optional full analysis schedule of the run.  When given, a report
        is kept only at the analysis nearest its valid time, so no report
        enters two cycles.  When omitted the caller owns that guarantee.

    Returns
    -------
    ``(batches, provenance)``.  Batch names are ``<seam quantity>:<source>``
    (e.g. ``temperature_2m:asos``) -- the seam's own quantity id, suffixed
    with the record's provenance source, never a hardcoded network name.
    Observations sit at k = 0 of the station's gridpoint; the vertical
    localisation from there is well-defined because the filter's
    GridGeometry carries real column heights.
