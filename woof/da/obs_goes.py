"""Adapt one ``gpuwm-obs.goes-grid.v1`` file to the filter's batches.

The satellite twin of :mod:`woof.da.obs_radar`, with one structural
difference that governs everything else here: **CWP is a column integral,
so there is exactly one observation per column.**

:class:`woof.da.letkf.GriddedObs` wants ``(nz, ny, nx)``.  A column
observation is expressed in that shape by setting the mask True at one
level -- the ``obs_level`` the gridding stage recorded -- and False
everywhere else in the column.  It is *not* expressed by repeating the
value down the column: that would hand the filter ``nz`` copies of one
measurement, each with the full weight of an independent observation, and
the filter has no way to detect it.  A 50-level column would arrive
carrying 50x the information it has, and the analysis would follow it.

Two consequences the caller has to own, both recorded in the provenance
this module returns:

* **The vertical localisation radius is doing the column integration's
  work.**  The observation constrains the whole column but is centred at
  one level, so a radius that spans only part of the column silently
  assimilates a column integral as if it were a layer measurement.  This
  module measures the radius against the actual column depth and records
  the ratio; it does not refuse, because what fraction is right is a
  scoreboard question, not one this module gets to settle.
* **Suppression is the point, not a side effect.**  A clear-sky zero
  against a cloudy model is a large negative innovation, and with
  condensate in the analysis fields the ensemble covariance turns it into
  negative condensate increments across the localisation lens.  That is
  how obs-clear removes model cloud.  It only works if the lens reaches
  the levels where the model put the cloud -- which is the previous point,
  stated in the direction that matters most.
