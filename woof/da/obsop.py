"""EXPERIMENTAL (WOOF v1.2): radar observation operators H(x).

Two gridded operators, both pure functions of the model state, both
CuPy-first with a NumPy fallback, neither wired into any default route:

- :func:`simulated_reflectivity` -- 10 cm equivalent reflectivity (dBZ).
- :func:`radial_velocity` -- Doppler radial velocity (m/s) toward or away
  from a radar site, under 4/3-earth beam geometry.

They produce the model-grid half of the ``gpuwm-obs.radar-grid.v1`` obs
schema (gridded ``z_obs``/``vr_obs`` plus masks on the model grid), so an
ensemble filter can difference H(x) against the observation arrays
element-wise with no interpolation of its own.

Reflectivity: NO SECOND Z FORMULA
=================================

WOOF already computes reflectivity on the product side, and this module
does not reimplement it.  ``simulated_reflectivity`` is a thin,
shape-checking adapter over the existing authority:

- device path: ``woof.core.refl.compute_refl_10cm``
  (woof/core/refl.py:448) verbatim for schemes 1/6/8/10 -- the same call
  the microphysics adapters make for wrfout ``REFL_10CM`` -- and
  ``woof.core.nssl2_diagnostics.diagnose_radardd02_if_due`` for scheme 18,
  the same NSSL diagnostic the production coordinator runs;
- host path: the certified float64 column mirrors
  ``woof.verify.npref.np_refl10cm_morrison_column`` (npref.py:9204),
  ``np_refl10cm_wsm6_column`` (npref.py:9351) and
  ``np_refl10cm_kessler_column`` (npref.py:9460), applied column by
  column.  Thompson (8) and NSSL (18) have no host mirror and are CUDA
  only.

That authority is WRF v4.6.1 ``do_radar_ref=1`` / REFL_10CM, dispatched by
``mp_physics`` exactly as ``microphysics.apply`` dispatches, so the
operator inherits the ACTIVE scheme's own PSD assumptions rather than
imposing one scheme's assumptions on another:

- ``mp_physics=10`` -- Morrison ``refl10cm_hm``
  (phys/module_mp_morr_two_moment.F:4502-4675, wrapper floor :913-917).
  Two-moment rain/snow/graupel using the scheme's PROGNOSTIC number
  concentrations; ``morr_rimed_ice`` selects graupel vs hail density.
  Cloud water contributes nothing (the routine reads no cloud moment).
- ``mp_physics=6`` -- WSM6 ``refl10cm_wsm6``
  (phys/mp_wsm6.F90:2275-2444): fixed-intercept exponential PSDs,
  ``hail_opt`` selecting the rimed-ice density/intercept.
- ``mp_physics=8`` -- classic Thompson ``calc_refl10cm``
  (phys/module_mp_thompson.F:5710-6028), which additionally needs the
  scheme's same-call private graupel number moment.
- ``mp_physics=1`` -- Kessler has no reflectivity diagnostic in WRF, so
  the authority's documented fallback is the Smith et al. (1975)
  fixed-intercept (N0r = 8e6 m-4) rain-only Rayleigh form derived at
  woof/core/refl.py:30-43.
- ``mp_physics=18`` -- NSSL two-moment ``radardd02``
  (phys/module_mp_nssl_2mom.F): five ice categories, five predicted
  number moments and the graupel/hail volume moments, S-band, CUDA only.
  It is a genuine scheme port, not an adapter over one of the above, so
  it lives in ``woof.core.nssl2_diagnostics`` and is dispatched to
  verbatim here.  Two departures from the 1/6/8/10 family the caller must
  carry: radardd02 floors at **0 dBZ**, not -35, and it reads five ice
  categories plus their moments rather than the shared rain-first set.
- ``mp_physics=50`` -- P3 is REFUSED BY NAME and is not in either list
  above; see :data:`NATIVE_Z_NOT_SEPARABLE_FROM_THE_STEP` for the reason
  text the refusal prints.  P3 is an active scheme and it does produce
  reflectivity -- ``woof.core.p3`` stashes the scheme's own diagnostic Z
  as REFL_10CM -- but that Z is computed inside ``p3_main``'s final
  diagnostics loop, which is simultaneously a state update, so there is
  no pure H_Z(x) to adapt over.  ``woof.core.refl.compute_refl_10cm``
  carries no mp=50 branch for the same reason and must not gain one here.

The 1/6/8/10/16/28 routes share the -35 dBZ floor, the 1e-9 kg/kg species
activity threshold, and the ``refl10cm_hm`` air-density diagnosis, so
their outputs are interchangeable in one obs array.  NSSL (18) is native
S-band with a 0 dBZ floor, and Milbrandt-Yau (9) is native with a -99 dBZ
floor; neither is floor-interchangeable with that family.

Documented simplifications
==========================

1. **Fall speed is not the per-scheme reflectivity-weighted integral.**
   The bound Z formulations compute Ze only; none of them exposes a
   reflectivity-weighted mean terminal velocity.  Rather than invent a
   fourth PSD integration, :func:`reflectivity_fall_speed` uses the
   standard radar-DA relation of Sun and Crook (1997, J. Atmos. Sci. 54,
   1642-1661; 1998, J. Atmos. Sci. 55, 835-852), the same closure
   WRF-DA's ``da_radial_velocity`` and Tong and Xue (2005, Mon. Wea.
   Rev. 133, 1789-1807) use, driven by the SAME dBZ field the bound Z
   operator produced:

       vt = 5.40 * (ps/p)**0.4 * 10**(0.125*(Z - 43.1)/17.5)  [m/s, down]

   ``ps`` is the SURFACE pressure, supplied by the caller, not the
   1000 hPa thermodynamic reference: that is what Sun and Crook wrote
   and what WRFDA's ``da_radial_velocity.inc`` implements, and the
   substitution is a systematic +4.3%/+9.3%/+15.3% error in ``vt`` over
   a 900/800/700 hPa surface.

   That form is Sun and Crook's ``vt = 5.40*a*(rho*qr)**0.125`` with
   ``rho*qr`` eliminated through their ``Z = 43.1 + 17.5*log10(rho*qr)``,
   and their Z leg is exactly the Marshall-Palmer/Smith-1975 PSD the
   Kessler fallback here implements -- so on ``mp_physics=1`` the fall
   speed and the reflectivity share one PSD (checked numerically in
   :func:`reflectivity_fall_speed`).  On the Morrison, WSM6 and Thompson
   paths the richer scheme PSD supplies Z while the fall speed is still
   read off the Marshall-Palmer rain calibration: it consumes that
   scheme's Z, but it is NOT a moment integral over that scheme's PSD,
   and it overstates the fall speed of dry snow aloft.

   Because a power law in Z does not vanish in clear air (it still gives
   ~1.7 m/s at the -35 dBZ floor), the fall speed is gated OFF wherever
   the reflectivity authority itself sees no active hydrometeor: the
   1e-9 kg/kg threshold applied PER SPECIES to qr, qs, qg and qh, active
   where ANY of them clears it, exactly as ``refl10cm_hm`` tests each
   category before adding its Ze.  Gating the SUM instead -- which this
   module did -- activates cells whose every species is individually
   inactive: four at 3e-10 kg/kg contribute no reflectivity at all and
   used to switch on a 5.244 m/s fall speed.  (WRFDA's Sun-Crook gates on
   rain alone above 1e-5 kg/kg; that is the other defensible authority
   and it is NOT this one, because the Z consumed here is the model
   scheme's multi-species Z and not a rain-only one.)  Callers who want a
   different closure pass ``fall_speed=<array>``; callers who want pure
   air motion pass ``fall_speed="none"``.

2. **Straight-ray 4/3-earth geometry, no beam-volume weighting.**  The
   operator evaluates the beam direction at each model mass point and
   projects the point wind onto it.  There is no Gaussian beam-power
   weighting across the sample volume and no along-beam averaging: at
   nest resolutions the model cell is smaller than the radar gate, which
   is a resolution mismatch the obs-error covariance must absorb, not
   something this operator claims to solve.

3. **No attenuation, no beam blockage, no ground clutter, no dual-pol.**

4. **Spherical earth.**  Radius ``1/gpuwm.core.constants.RERADIUS`` =
   6 370 000 m, the same value ``woof.static.projection.EARTH_RADIUS_M``
   uses, so the beam geometry is consistent with the projection the grid
   was built on.

    ``mp_physics=8`` carries no graupel number in the Registry.  WRF's
    ``mp_gt_driver`` DIAGNOSES one from qg at the beginning of every
    call, evolves that private moment through the source and
    sedimentation operators, applies one final lower bound and MVD
    reconstruction, and hands the result to ``calc_refl10cm``
    (module_mp_thompson.F 1265-1281, 1915-1939 and 4059-4077).  woof
    transcribes the two ends of that as
    ``launch_classic_graupel_number_init`` and
    ``launch_classic_graupel_number_finalize``, and the microphysics
    adapter passes the evolved moment to the reflectivity operator on
    every output-due step.  The operator requires it rather than
    inventing one, which is right for an in-call caller: a shadow that
    skipped the call's source and fallout tendencies would not be the
    moment WRF's own Z read.

    AN OBSERVATION OPERATOR IS NOT AN IN-CALL CALLER.  H_Z(x) is
    evaluated BETWEEN steps, on a state no microphysics call is in the
    middle of, and for that state the wrapper's diagnosis IS the moment:
    no tendency has acted since, so init followed by finalize is exactly
    the sequence WRF would carry into ``calc_refl10cm`` on a call whose
    graupel tendency was zero.  Both ends read only qg, T, p and qv off
    the state, so the derivation asks for nothing the analysis does not
    already hold.

    Written into the microphysics adapter's own shadow slot rather than
    a second buffer: it is the same quantity, the slot is scratch the
    scheme rewrites unconditionally at the entry of its next call, and a
    DA operator runs between calls, so there is no value here for this
    to destroy.

    Returns ``(temperature, pressure, shadow)`` because the temperature
    the shadow was diagnosed at is the temperature the reflectivity has
    to be diagnosed at; handing the pair on is what keeps the two from
    being formed twice and differing.

    ``temperature``/``pressure`` are the microphysics-time pair WRF hands
    the diagnostic (``t1d``/``p1d``); supply both or neither.  Omitting
    them diagnoses temperature from the current state, which is the
    right choice for a DA operator evaluated between steps.

    ``mp_physics`` 8 and 28 carry no graupel number in the Registry and

    the whole Thompson family with no H_Z(x) at all.

    ``mp_physics=50`` is refused BY NAME through

    with ``ps`` the surface pressure, exactly as WRFDA's
    ``da_radial_velocity.inc`` takes it -- a separate ``ps`` argument, then
    ``alpha = (ps/p)**0.4``.  Substituting the thermodynamic reference
    constant ``P0 = 1000 hPa`` is a different closure and a systematic one:
    the ratio of the two is ``(100000/ps)**0.4``, constant through the
    column, so it is +4.3% at a 900 hPa surface, +9.3% at 800 hPa and
    +15.3% at 700 hPa, always making ``vt`` too large and always pushing
    the positive-away radial velocity inbound by ``-dvt*sin(el)``.  There
    is no default because a constant is not a field.

    Sun and Crook state two relations for Marshall-Palmer rain, both with
    ``rho*qr`` in g m-3 and ``a = (ps/p)**0.4``:

        Z[dBZ] = 43.1 + 17.5*log10(rho*qr)
        vt     = 5.40 * a * (rho*qr)**0.125

    Eliminating ``rho*qr`` gives the form used here, which consumes the
    bound Z operator's output directly:

        vt = 5.40 * (ps/p)**0.4 * 10**(0.125*(Z - 43.1)/17.5)

    The Z leg is not an outside assumption: it *is* the Smith et al.
    (1975) exponential-PSD form woof's Kessler fallback implements
    (woof/core/refl.py:30-43).  At ``rho*qr = 1 g m-3`` that PSD gives
    ``lambda = (pi*1000*8e6/1e-3)**0.25 = 2239 m-1`` and
    ``Ze = 720*8e6/lambda**7 * 1e18 = 2.04e4 mm^6 m^-3`` = 43.1 dBZ,
    exactly Sun and Crook's intercept.  So on the ``mp_physics=1`` path
    the fall speed and the reflectivity share one PSD; on the Morrison,
    WSM6 and Thompson paths their richer PSDs supply Z while the fall
    speed is still read off the Marshall-Palmer rain calibration, which
    is the documented approximation (see the module docstring).

    Because the relation is a power law it does not vanish in clear air
    (~1.7 m/s at the -35 dBZ floor), so ``active`` gates it to cells the
    reflectivity authority calls active.  ``active`` is a BOOLEAN mask,
    normally :func:`precipitating_activity_mask` -- ANY species above
    ``1e-9 kg/kg``, tested per species exactly as ``refl10cm_hm`` tests
    them.  A float mixing-ratio array is REFUSED rather than thresholded:
    this argument used to be the summed ``qr+qs+qg(+qh)`` field, gated at
    ``1e-9``, and four species at ``3e-10`` each -- every one of them
    inactive to the Z operator -- summed past it and switched on a
    5.244 m/s fall speed.  Accepting the old argument silently would keep
    that behaviour reachable from every existing caller.

    Positive AWAY from the radar (outbound), the standard convention.

        Vr = u_e*cos(el)*sin(az) + v_n*cos(el)*cos(az) + (w - vt)*sin(el)

    with elevation and azimuth taken at the model mass point under 4/3-
    earth beam geometry (:func:`beam_geometry`), winds destaggered to
    mass points and rotated earth-relative, and ``vt`` the downward
    hydrometeor fall speed.

    ``geometry`` may be omitted only if the state carries ``xlat``/
    ``xlong``; otherwise :meth:`GridGeometry.from_state` raises rather
    than guessing where the domain is.

    ``fall_speed`` is one of:

    - ``"reflectivity"`` (default) -- Sun and Crook (1997) from the bound
      Z operator's own dBZ.  Supply ``reflectivity_dbz=`` (cheapest, and
      what an ensemble filter already has in hand) or ``cfg=`` to let
      this call :func:`simulated_reflectivity` itself.  Supplying
      neither raises: silently dropping the fall-speed term would change
      the operator's physics without saying so.  This closure also needs
      ``surface_pressure=`` -- ``(ny, nx)`` in Pa -- for its density
      factor, on the same argument.
    - ``"none"`` -- pure air motion, ``vt = 0``.  A documented
      simplification, not a default.
    - an array ``(nz, ny, nx)`` -- caller's own closure, m/s downward.

    ``dtype`` defaults to the state's wind dtype (float32).  Pass
    ``numpy.float64`` for analytic work where round-off matters.
