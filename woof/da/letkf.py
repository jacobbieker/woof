"""LETKF -- local ensemble transform Kalman filter, batched for the GPU.

EXPERIMENTAL.  Nothing in the forecast path calls this module; it is a pure
addition behind an explicit import.  No config default routes through it.

Algorithm authority
-------------------
Hunt, Kostelich and Szunyogh (2007), *Efficient data assimilation for
spatiotemporal chaos: a local ensemble transform Kalman filter*, Physica D
230, 112-126 -- specifically the boxed recipe of their section 2.3, steps
(1)-(9).  The notation below is theirs:

    Xb   (m x R)   background ensemble perturbations about the mean
    Yb   (p x R)   H(x_k) perturbations about the mean of H(x_k)
    C    (R x p)   Yb^T R^-1                     [step 4]
    Pa~  (R x R)   [(R-1)I/rho + C Yb]^-1        [step 5]
    Wa   (R x R)   [(R-1) Pa~]^1/2, SYMMETRIC    [step 6]
    wa_  (R)       Pa~ C (y^o - ybar)            [step 7]
    w_k  (R)       wa_ + Wa[:, k]                [step 8]
    x_k  (m)       xbar + Xb w_k                 [step 9]

Two departures from a literal transcription, both deliberate and both tested:

* the symmetric square root in step 6 is formed from the eigendecomposition
  that already produced Pa~, not from a second factorisation.  One
  ``eigh`` of ``(R-1)I/rho + C Yb = U D U^T`` gives both
  ``Pa~ = U D^-1 U^T`` and ``Wa = U D^-1/2 U^T sqrt(R-1)``.  This is the
  standard implementation and is what makes the batched form cheap.
* gridpoints with no valid localised observation are *excluded from the
  solve entirely* rather than passed through it.  With C = 0 the recipe
  collapses to a closed form -- ``Pa~ = rho/(R-1) I``, ``Wa = sqrt(rho)
  I``, ``wa_ = 0`` -- so the answer is written down instead of computed:
  ``x_k = xbar + sqrt(rho) x'_k``.  Evaluating it through ``eigh`` would
  make the ``rho = 1`` case depend on the eigendecomposition of a scaled
  identity returning exactly ``U U^T = I``, which no LAPACK or cuSOLVER
  contract promises, and the gate on this module asserts increments are
  EXACTLY zero beyond the localisation cutoff at ``rho = 1``.

  :mod:`woof.core.jacobi_eigh` does promise it -- a diagonal matrix clears
  no rotation threshold, so ``U`` comes back the literal identity -- but the
  closed form stays, because the guarantee should not become a property of
  which eigensolver a caller configured.

  What the closed form must NOT do is drop the ``sqrt(rho)`` along with
  the solve.  Prior inflation is a property of the transform, not of the
  observation set: the perturbation stretch applies at every gridpoint,
  and only the *observation* increment is confined to the lens.  An
  earlier version of this module skipped both, which was a spatially
  discontinuous error -- as a Gaspari-Cohn weight approached zero from
  inside the cutoff ``Wa`` tended to ``sqrt(rho) I``, and at the cutoff
  the code jumped to ``Wa = I``.  See :func:`analyze`'s inactive-point
  scaling.

Why batching is the whole GPU win
---------------------------------
The per-gridpoint work is an R x R symmetric eigendecomposition with
R <= ~40.  On its own that is far too small to occupy a GPU -- a single
40x40 ``eigh`` is microseconds of arithmetic wrapped in tens of microseconds
of launch overhead, and a loop over 400k gridpoints spends essentially all
of its wall clock in Python and kernel launches.  Stacking thousands of them
into one ``(G, R, R)`` array and issuing a single batched solve turns the
launch overhead into a rounding error and runs all G problems concurrently.

That batched solve is this project's own kernel --
:mod:`woof.core.jacobi_eigh`, one thread block per gridpoint, cyclic Jacobi
in shared memory -- and not a library call.  It is the same ALGORITHM
cuSOLVER's ``syevj`` uses, so the change is not a numerical opinion; what it
buys is that the DA path no longer depends on a CUDA library that the rest of
this project has never needed, and whose absence presents as "elementwise
CuPy works, the factorisation does not".  ``LetkfConfig.eigensolver`` keeps
``xp.linalg.eigh`` reachable, and is what the A/B in
``tests/test_letkf_eigensolver.py`` switches.  See
``docs/da_jacobi_eigensolver.md``.

Every array in the inner loop
therefore carries a leading gridpoint axis, and the only Python-level
iteration is over chunks (see ``LetkfConfig.chunk_points``), sized to bound
peak memory rather than to bound work.

Localisation
------------
R-localisation (Hunt et al. section 3.2's "observation error inflation"
variant, as used by essentially every operational LETKF): the local
observation error variance is divided by a Gaspari-Cohn weight, so an
observation at the cutoff has infinite error and contributes nothing, and
an observation beyond the cutoff is dropped from the gridpoint's batch.
Horizontal and vertical weights multiply.  The exact piecewise quintic is
:func:`gaspari_cohn`.

Because the observation array is gridded on the *model* grid (contract
``gpuwm-obs.radar-grid.v1``, see :class:`GriddedObs`), the set of
observations local to a gridpoint is a fixed box in index space rather than
a ragged neighbour list.  That is what makes the gather uniform and the
batch rectangular: no padding bookkeeping, no per-point obs counts, one
stencil shared by every gridpoint.

That index box is a *superset*, not the metric.  Distances are physical
metres between the two gridpoints actually being related -- a geodesic
between their mass-point coordinates when the grid is geolocated, and a
height difference taken in each point's own column -- and they are
evaluated per pair inside the batch, because on a projected,
terrain-following grid neither quantity is a function of the index offset
alone.  The stencil is sized from the smallest spacing anywhere on the
grid, so it cannot exclude a pair the metric would have included; slots it
includes that the metric puts at or beyond the cutoff take a weight of
exactly zero and drop out.  See :class:`GridGeometry`.

Inflation
---------
RTPS -- relaxation to prior spread, Whitaker and Hamill (2012) eq. 6:

    Xa <- Xa * [ alpha * (sigma_b - sigma_a) / sigma_a + 1 ]

applied pointwise, per analysis field, after the transform and before the
increment is formed.  ``alpha = 0`` disables it.  The relaxed spread is
``alpha*sigma_b + (1-alpha)*sigma_a``, so ``alpha = 1`` restores the prior
spread exactly and ``alpha`` outside [0, 1] is refused.

**RTPP** (relaxation to prior perturbation, Zhang et al. 2004) is now
available beside it as ``LetkfConfig.relaxation = "rtpp"``:

    Xa <- (1 - alpha) Xa + alpha Xb

It needs no spread diagnostics and it relaxes the analysis *covariance
structure*, not just its amplitude, which is the reason to prefer it when
the localisation is aggressive enough to distort cross-covariances -- as
it is when a rank-``R-1`` ensemble meets a dense radar volume.  The two
are not interchangeable: RTPS restores a target SPREAD pointwise and is
blind to which direction in ensemble space lost it, while RTPP restores a
fraction of the prior PERTURBATION and therefore preserves the prior's
correlations between fields.  Which one a domain wants is an empirical
question, so this module ships both and records in
:class:`LetkfDiagnostics` which one ran, next to the prior and posterior
spread it produced.

One alternative is documented but NOT built here:

* **Additive inflation** (Mitchell and Houtekamer 2000): add scaled random
  draws to the analysis perturbations.  This is the only one of the three
  that can restore *rank*, so it is the right answer when the R <= 40
  subspace has collapsed rather than merely shrunk -- and, unlike either
  relaxation, it is the only one that can counteract spread lost in the
  FORECAST step rather than in the analysis.  It is not in this module
  because it is not a property of the transform: it is a perturbation
  drawn on the model grid and added to a state, which is
  :mod:`woof.da.perturb`'s job and a caller's cycle policy.  A version
  that drew white noise here instead would inject exactly the
  small-scale imbalance the model then has to reject.

Multiplicative prior inflation is available as ``LetkfConfig.prior_inflation``
(the ``rho`` of step 5) since it costs one scalar in the batched solve.

Both relaxations leave the inactive-point closed form unchanged, which is
not a coincidence: at a gridpoint with no localised observation
``Xa = sqrt(rho) Xb``, so RTPS gives ``[(1-alpha) sqrt(rho) + alpha] Xb``
and RTPP gives ``[(1-alpha) sqrt(rho) + alpha] Xb`` -- the same scalar.
The bitwise-zero guarantee beyond the cutoff at ``rho = 1`` therefore
holds for both.

Fail-closed policy
------------------
Every degenerate input raises :class:`LetkfError` with a diagnostic.  None
of them returns NaN, and none silently returns the prior.  Specifically:
ensembles smaller than two members; non-positive or non-finite observation
errors on unmasked observations; non-finite priors or simulated
observations; an analysis field whose prior ensemble has no spread anywhere
(that is not an ensemble); shape disagreements between any two inputs; a
localisation radius that is not finite and positive; and -- as a backstop
that catches anything the specific checks missed -- a non-finite value
anywhere in the computed increments.

class LetkfConfig:
    """Everything the filter needs that is not data.

    analysis_fields
        Which state fields the analysis updates, in the order increments are
        returned.  Named explicitly rather than inferred from the prior dict
        so that a caller can hand in a full state and update a subset --
        hydrometeors in particular are frequently withheld.
    rtps_alpha
        Relaxation to prior spread, in [0, 1].  REQUIRED, and deliberately:
        there is no defensible default.  ``0.0`` disables the relaxation
        entirely, and a cycling ensemble run without any posterior
        relaxation loses spread until it stops responding to observations
        -- which shows up as a forecast that quietly stops improving, not
        as an error.  Storm-scale ensemble systems typically run somewhere
        in 0.8-0.95, but the right value is settled by cycling statistics
        on the domain in question, so this asks rather than assumes.  It is
        recorded in :class:`LetkfDiagnostics` so the choice appears in the
        log next to its consequences.
    prior_inflation
        The ``rho`` of Hunt et al. step 5: multiplicative inflation of the
        background covariance, applied as ``(R-1)I/rho``.  1.0 disables it.
        Unlike ``rtps_alpha`` this one has a default, because 1.0 is a
        genuine identity -- the transform is exactly what the recipe gives
        with no inflation -- rather than a disabled safety feature.
    chunk_points
        Gridpoints per batched solve, or None (the default) to size it from
        ``memory_budget_mib`` once the stencil is known.

        A fixed default is a footgun, because the per-point cost is not
        known until the localisation radii meet the grid spacing: a
        perfectly ordinary 8 km radius on a 2 km grid with 30 members
        gives P = 315 slots and turns a 8192-point chunk into 620 MiB *per
        array*, several GiB at peak, on a card that is very likely shared.
        Setting it from a budget instead means the radius and the ensemble
        size stay free parameters and only the number of batches changes.

        An explicit value is taken as given -- it bypasses the budget and
        the free-memory reading -- but it is still a starting point, not a
        promise to die for: a device allocation failure mid-analysis
        shrinks the chunk and re-solves, exactly as it does for the
        auto-sized path, and the shrink is recorded in the diagnostics.
    memory_budget_mib
        Ceiling on the batched solve's own scratch, when ``chunk_points``
        is None.  Enforced, not aspirational: the chunk is sized so that
        :func:`solve_bytes_per_point` times the chunk stays under this
        figure AND under ``_DEVICE_FREE_FRACTION`` of the memory the card
        actually has free at solve time.  A device allocation failure that
        arrives anyway halves the chunk and re-solves instead of failing
        the analysis; the only refusal is the accurate one, raised by name,
        when even a single gridpoint cannot fit the ceiling.  (An earlier
        revision documented this figure as "not a hard limit" and priced
        only the member-slot arrays; sized that way, a single-radar
        1845-slot stencil chose 7248-point chunks and ran a 32 GiB card
        out of memory.)

        WHAT IT COSTS A CARD.  It bounds the chunk loop's own accounted
        scratch and not the whole-domain work around it -- the prior, the
        increments, the simulated observations, the stencil masks -- so it
        is a knob rather than a device-bytes promise.  Measured at the
        Level-II single-radar geometry on an RTX 3090, above that case's
        between-legs level, the analysis grows the card by about 1.25
        times this figure: 2.4 GiB at 2048, 7.3 GiB at 6144.  Size a card
        from that, with room to spare, and re-measure for a geometry that
        is not this one; the constants block above says how.

        512 MiB is a deliberately conservative default for a shared card,
        and it costs throughput.  Measured on an RTX 5090 (sm_120), R = 30,
        a 405-slot stencil, float64 solve, in active gridpoints per second:

            chunk       1 ->     305      (a per-gridpoint loop)
            chunk       8 ->   2,351
            chunk      64 ->  18,623
            chunk     512 ->  71,829
            chunk   2,048 ->  95,452      saturated
            chunk   8,192 ->  94,293
            numpy, same case ->  5,677

        Throughput saturates near 2,048 gridpoints per batch.  Raise this
        when the card is yours; the answer does not change with it, only
        the number of batches.
    solve_dtype
        Precision of the R x R eigenproblem.  float64 by default and
        deliberately: the R x R solve is a vanishing fraction of total work
        even at 1/64 rate, the eigenvalues of ``(R-1)I + C Yb`` span the
        ensemble's condition number, and float32 subnormals are flushed in
        every kernel cupy compiles -- it appends ``-ftz=true`` after the
        caller's options -- which float64 sidesteps entirely.  The gather
        and the final ``Xb @ W`` stay in the input dtype.
    eigensolver
        Which batched symmetric eigensolver factors the R x R matrix; see
        :data:`EIGENSOLVER_MODES`.  ``"auto"`` -- the default -- prefers
        this project's own kernel, so nothing on the DA path needs cuSOLVER
        installed at the ensemble sizes that kernel supports.

# The coefficients below are an audit of the chunk loop in :func:`analyze`,
# not a wish.  Each one counts arrays of a given shape class that are alive
# AT THE SAME TIME at the loop's peak, which is the ``cmat @ yb`` matmul of
# phase 2: by then the promoted sim gather ``s``, the pre-mask perturbations
# (pinned by ``yb_parts``), the masked ``yb``, and ``cmat`` all coexist, and
# the gather's astype transient and the matmul's own workspace ride on top.
#
# ``_CHUNK_ALLOCATOR_SLACK`` is the one number that is a policy rather than
# a count.  A pool allocator does not return freed blocks to the card
# between batches, batch sizes drift as the active-point count drifts, and
# split blocks do not always recombine, so the pool's footprint ratchets
# above any single instant's liveness.  The chunk loop therefore caps the
# pool at what one chunk is entitled to -- the liveness sum above, times
# this factor -- and hands the rest back before the next batch allocates.
#
# WHAT THAT CAP IS WORTH, measured.  On an RTX 3090 (sm_86, cupy 14.1.1)
# at the single-radar Level-II geometry this section exists for -- 1845
# slots, R = 10, float64, 853776 gridpoints -- the same analysis was
# replayed with the cap in and with it out, same budget, same chunk, same
# batch count, card sampled at 10 Hz.  Device high-water:
#
#     budget 2048 MiB, chunk 1013:  11040 MiB without ->  4506 MiB with
#     budget 6144 MiB, chunk 3039:  23000 MiB without ->  9618 MiB with
#
# Thirteen gigabytes at the operating point, for about 3% of solve time
# (10.2 s against 9.8).  Nothing else moved: identical chunk, identical
# 256 batches, no shrinks either way.  That difference is the ratchet and
# nothing but the ratchet, and it is why an analysis whose accounted
# liveness is around 3 GiB could run a 32 GiB card out of memory.
#
# WHAT THE BUDGET THEN BUYS.  Above the between-legs level of this case
# (2134 MiB of model state and CUDA context), the analysis grows the card
# by about 1.25 x memory_budget_mib with the cap in -- 2.4 GiB at 2048,
# 7.3 GiB at 6144, no meaningful intercept.  Without the cap the same
# figures are 8.7 and 20.4 GiB, which is where the "3.3 GiB plus 2.7x"
# rule an earlier revision of this comment stated came from; that rule
# described the uncapped loop and is superseded.  Size a card from the
# 1.25, and leave room: the budget still does not count the prior, the

    Parameters
    ----------
    prior
        ``{field_name: array (R, nz, ny, nx)}``. numpy or cupy. With
        solve_namespace set, these remain on the host and only a bounded
        compact gather and the float64 local transform use that namespace.
    obs
        Observation batches (:class:`GriddedObs`).  An empty sequence, or
        one whose masks are all False, is a legitimate no-observation
        cycle: every gridpoint is inactive, so every increment is the
        inactive-point transform below.  At the default
        ``prior_inflation = 1`` that transform is the exact identity and
        the cycle returns bitwise-zero increments -- the no-DA control.
        With ``prior_inflation != 1`` it is the intended whole-domain
        inflation of an unobserved cycle, not zero.
    grid
        Localisation metric.  ``grid.nz`` must match the prior.
    config
        See :class:`LetkfConfig`.
    diagnostics
        Optional; filled in place if given.
    solve_namespace
        Optional numerical namespace for a host-backed solve. Inputs and
        increments remain numpy arrays. Every positive-weight neighbour is
        retained, in batch and stencil order; only zero terms are removed.
    progress
        Optional callback receiving completed gridpoint/chunk counts. No
        estimate of remaining time is inferred from these measurements.

    Returns
    -------
    ``{field_name: array (R, nz, ny, nx)}`` -- the increment to ADD to each
    prior member.  Increments rather than the analysis state because the
    caller owns the state: it knows which fields have positivity constraints,
    which are staggered, and how to journal a partial update.  A filter that
    returns a state has already made those decisions on the caller's behalf.

    At every gridpoint with no observation inside its localisation cutoff
    the returned increment is the closed-form inactive-point transform,
    ``(s - 1) x'`` with ``s = (1 - alpha) sqrt(rho) + alpha``: the ensemble
    mean is untouched and the perturbations carry Hunt's prior inflation
    relaxed by RTPS.  At the default ``rho = 1`` that scaling is the exact
    identity and those increments are bitwise zero -- not nearly zero --
    which is the guarantee the localisation gate rests on.

        ``stencils`` is the subset of observation batches that can reach
        this span -- see :func:`_batch_reach_box`.  Shadowing the enclosing
        name is deliberate: every use inside this function must go through
        the filtered list, and shadowing makes an accidental use of the
        full one impossible rather than merely discouraged.  The batches it
        leaves out contribute identically zero weight, so the arithmetic
        below is the same arithmetic on a shorter concatenation.

        Idempotent by construction: everything it writes is a plain
        assignment into ``incr_flat`` at the chunk's own gridpoints, and
        every statistic is returned rather than accumulated.  That is what
        makes the caller's out-of-memory retry safe -- an attempt that
        died anywhere in here can be re-run over the same span, in any
        number of smaller pieces, without double-counting a batch or
        re-adding an increment.

        Idempotent is not bit-invariant, and the difference was MEASURED
        rather than assumed.  Each gridpoint's transform is mathematically
        independent of how gridpoints are batched, and on numpy -- where
        the batched eigensolve and the matmuls are per-matrix loops -- a
        re-solve at a different chunk really is bitwise identical.  On the
        device it is not: cuBLAS and the batched eigensolver pick work
        partitionings from the batch extent, so the same gridpoint's
        summations happen in a different order.  Measured on an RTX 3090
        (sm_86, cupy 14.1.1, float64), re-solving the same analysis at
        chunks of 16, 8 and 1 against a 32-point reference moved
        increments by at most 3.1e-15 in absolute terms, a few ulp of the
        values themselves.  So a run that took the degradation path is the
        same analysis to rounding, not the same bytes, and
        ``chunk_oom_shrinks`` in the receipt is what says which happened.

    # card on its own, and with batch sizes drifting as the active-point
    # count drifts, freed blocks stop matching future requests -- measured
    # on an RTX 3090 (cupy 14.1.1), the loop at a 2416-point chunk and an
    # 1845-slot stencil ratcheted the device from ~8.5 GiB to 24.1 GiB of
    # a 24.6 GiB card over ~350 batches, an order of magnitude over any
    # single batch's liveness.  So: whenever the pool's total crosses what
    # the loop is entitled to (everything in use before the loop, plus the
    # priced scratch of one chunk), the idle blocks go back to the driver
    # before the next chunk allocates.  Second, the retry: an allocation
    # failure inside a chunk is not a verdict on the analysis, it is a
    # verdict on the chunk.  Halve it, hand the dead attempt's blocks
    # back, and re-solve the same span.  The refusal below fires only when
    # the chunk is already one gridpoint, at which point no smaller solve
    # exists and the accurate answer is the named remedy, not another retry.
