"""Draw every committed frame, on every grid, while the forecast runs.

THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES: during a nested run (12 km with 3 km and 1 km
nests) the page showed the 12 km grid only.  The early render
(:mod:`woof.first_products`) draws the first root frame, and every other
picture, every nest's included, waited for the forecast to end.  Measured
on a 5070 Ti: the whole default product set for one output time takes
5.4 s at 12 km (170x170), 8.3 s at 3 km (336x336) and 11.2 s at 1 km
(408x402), while that three-grid stack takes about 170 s of wall per
model hour, so drawing each frame as it lands keeps up many times over.

How it runs, and why each part is shaped so:

- **Bounded concurrent frames.** Frames enter one queue in commit order.
  Up to three CPU render processes overlap
  import and drawing. They divide the native product workers and memory
  allowance between them, reserving one processor for the forecast.
  Smaller hosts, a container's CPU quota and a host whose free memory
  holds fewer frames draw fewer at a time, down to one.  Each frame is
  priced from its own grid (:func:`live_frame_peak_bytes`) and starts
  only when the frames already drawing leave room for it, so a large
  grid's frames draw one or two at a time where a small grid's overlap.
  Publication remains serialized.
- **Never blocks the model.**  :meth:`LiveProducts.frame_committed`
  appends to a queue and returns; it is called on the wrfout writer's
  thread and never raises.
- **The finalize stage's own command, with at most ONE HOUR of earlier
  frames.**  Each frame is drawn by :func:`woof.go_cli.render_command`
  from the same plan dict the end of run uses.  A frame on a whole hour
  is drawn beside every frame of its grid since the previous whole-hour
  frame, which is the hour it closes, when the request holds a window
  (:func:`requests_windows`); every other frame, and every frame of a
  request with no window, is drawn alone.
  Measured on the 5070 Ti host at 1 km (414x402): the renderer's import
  costs about 6 s per frame and drawing a frame's 204 pictures about
  3.5 s, so the last frame of nine drawn with its eight predecessors as
  baselines took 62 s against 12 s alone, and a live render carrying its
  grid's history fell further behind with every frame.  One hour of
  baselines is a fixed cost however long the run (one import on an
  hourly grid, four on a 15-minute one), and it is what the windowed
  family (``qpf_1h``, ``qpf_total``, the 1 h maxima) needs: those were
  drawn only after the forecast ended while every frame was drawn alone
  ("windowed accumulations need more than one stored whole-hour
  frame").  The frames between the hours are not optional on a
  sub-hourly grid: the history writer resets ``UP_HELI_MAX`` and the
  other 1 h maxima at each write (:mod:`woof.core.uh_diag`), so a
  whole-hour frame alone holds only the last interval of its hour.  The
  engine decides which windows the hour closes, and blocks the rest by
  name (``qpf_6h``, run maxima: "missing stored hour(s)", or on a
  sub-hourly grid "unevenly spaced"), so a window longer than the hour
  is never drawn short, the 10 m wind maxima included.
  :func:`windowed_passes` names what finalize still draws over each
  grid's whole series, the longer windows of the frames drawn live, and
  a frame the live pass did not finish is drawn at the end beside its
  grid's whole series (:func:`baseline_frames`).
- **A request made only of windows is drawn where windows end.**  A
  grid's first frame and its frames between whole hours close no
  window, so such a request drew nothing there: each live render exited
  1 with no picture, and handed the same frames the end-of-run batch
  did too, which stopped ``woof go``'s render stage before the frames
  that close windows were drawn.  Those frames are drawn neither live
  nor in the batch, and stay the baselines of every window
  (:func:`windows_only`, :func:`closes_a_window`).
- **Nothing half-written is published.**  Each frame is drawn into a
  dot-prefixed scratch under the render folder and moved onto its final
  ``<domain>/<product>/<valid-day>/`` name with :func:`os.replace` once
  the subprocess exits, exactly as the early render publishes.
- **The end-of-run render fills only what is missing.**  Every published
  frame is recorded in ``live-products.json`` with its pictures'
  digests; :func:`published_frames` lets finalize skip a frame only when
  the frame is unchanged on disk and every picture it recorded is still
  there with its digest.  At finalize the queue is drained (each frame
  costs seconds and the history is already written), bounded by a wait
  after which whatever is left is drawn in the end-of-run batch.
- **The map record is merged, never replaced.**  Each frame's
  ``render-georef.json`` entries are folded into the render folder's
  manifest through :mod:`woof.render_georef`.
- **Every route that writes history arms it.**  The run-plan observer
  (:class:`woof.runplan.RunObserver`) and the downscaled child
  (:class:`woof.offline_child_run._ChildProgress`) build it from the
  plan their finalize stage renders, beside the early render and on the
  same render slots. A downscaled child used to draw its analysis frame early
  and every other frame at the end: a 250 m child's second frame landed
  at 10:40 and was drawn at 13:16.
- **A stopped run stops drawing.**  :meth:`LiveProducts.halt` is the
  stop: nothing queued is drawn, the render in flight is ended and
  publishes nothing, and it returns within a few seconds, because the
  desktop's own stop kills the run 5 s after asking.  A render that
  ended on an interrupt (exit 130, or killed by a signal) is a stopped
  render and publishes nothing either: its output is whatever the
  renderer had staged when it was told to stop.

Telemetry never fails a run: every failure here is a ``warning`` event
and the frame is left for finalize.

    One ``(wanted, context, products)`` per grid.  Windows end on the
    grid's WHOLE-HOUR frames and are drawn over EVERY frame of the grid:
    on a 15-minute nest the history writer resets ``UP_HELI_MAX`` and the
    other 1 h maxima at each write, so a window drawn over the whole
    hours alone held only the last quarter hour of each hour, and the
    engine folds every frame inside a window.  Leaving such a grid out
    altogether, as this once did, left the 3 km nest of a 12/3 km run
    with no ``qpf_1h`` at all (0 of 49 frames) while its 12 km parent had
    12.

    ``wanted`` are the whole-hour frames after the grid's first (no
    window ends on the first frame of a series, and a launch that draws
    nothing is a failed launch) that were drawn live (``drawn``), each
    beside one hour of its series at most; the end-of-run batch draws
    every other frame beside the grid's whole series
    (:func:`baseline_frames`).  Less:

    - every frame whose recorded pictures (``recorded``, frame to
      product folders, :func:`recorded_products`) already hold each
      windowed product a NAMED request asks for: the live pass closed
      those windows while the forecast ran, and drawing them again is
      time spent on the same pictures;
    - every frame whose live render already held every earlier frame of
      its grid (``live_held``, frame to the frames its render imported,
      :func:`live_held`).  Every window the series closes there, the
      live render closed, which is how a group request, naming no one
      window, skips a frame.

    ``context`` is every other frame of the grid, the frames between its
    hours included.  An unrecognised frame name is its own grid and
    counts as whole-hour, which costs time and never a picture.

    ``prior_frames`` is a resumed run's history saved before its
    checkpoint (:func:`woof.restart_render.history_before_restart`).
    It joins each grid's series as context only, so the first whole
    hours after the checkpoint close their windows; it is never wanted.

    ``products`` is only the windowed part of the run's request
    (:func:`windowed_request`), so no instantaneous picture is drawn
    again; a request with no windowed member has no pass.
    ``windowed_slugs`` takes one frame and returns the engine's windowed
    slugs (:func:`engine_windowed_slugs`); it is called at most once, on
    the smallest frame of the passes, and only for a named list.
