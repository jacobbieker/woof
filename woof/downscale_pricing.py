"""One price and one ``[tiles]`` decision for a standalone offline child.

``woof downscale`` reviews a child before it runs and the child runner
integrates it.  Both used to answer the memory question on their own:
the plan review priced the configured envelope with the itemized
estimator and said ``fits: true``; the runner, minutes later and after it
had already filled the card with the interpolated initial state, the
boundary tables and the physics driver, asked the tile planner with no
estimate and no machine.  The planner then measured the card the process
had just spent on, charged the whole rung's fixed cost against what was
left and refused a child the review had admitted.  Measured on a 10 GiB
card: 7.32 GiB free at review, ``fits true`` at 2.90 GiB of envelope, then
"no tile fits in 3.49 GiB of VRAM" after preprocessing.

This module is the one function both doors call.  Given the child
RunConfig, its ``[tiles]`` options and a planning machine captured before
any device allocation, it builds the experiment, prices it once, stamps
the resident-admission context onto the options the way
:class:`woof.experiment.ExperimentConfig` does for its own tree, and asks
:func:`woof.core.streaming.decide` with that machine and that estimate.
The review writes the answer into the plan; the runner hands the same
answer to ``make_stepper``.  A refusal, when the card is genuinely too
small, is raised here with the measured figure and the way out, before
anything is interpolated or allocated on the device.
