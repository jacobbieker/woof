"""Immutable source-family authorities shipped with the RW-WPS wheel.

A PACKAGED PROFILE is a source whose three declarative authorities -- the
``rw-wps.mapping.v1`` mapping, the composition contract, and the terrain
provenance document -- ship inside the wheel and are pinned here by
SHA-256.  Everything else about such a source is table data too: its row in
:mod:`woof.source_adapters` names the profile, and the front door reads
the profile rather than a per-source function.

Adding a model to this file is three JSON documents and one row of
:data:`_PACKAGED_PROFILES`.  That is the whole point: a source whose
mapping is shipped is not a code path.

    ``data_role``/``provenance_role`` repeat what the composition document
    declares in ``supplements.terrain_height`` (or, for a cross-source
    profile, on the binding that provides terrain); they are stated here
    as well because the front door has to spell them on the command line
    BEFORE anything opens the composition, and a role the caller guesses is
    a role that silently binds the wrong file.  They are checked against
    the composition at decode time by
    :func:`woof.mapped_composition.decode_composed_source`, which refuses
    on any difference -- so a wrong row here fails loudly, not quietly.

    ``composition_state`` is ``"composed"`` for a runnable profile.  An
    atmosphere-only source -- complete 3-D state, zero published land
    surface -- ships ``"pending_cross_source"`` instead: its composition
    document is an explicit PENDING declaration
    (:data:`woof.mapped_composition.PENDING_COMPOSITION_SCHEMA`) that
    refuses to load by naming the state the source does not publish, it
    supplies no terrain supplement, and therefore it has no roles.  A
    pending profile decodes and inspects through the mapped route; it
    does not initialize anything until the cross-source composition
    supplying the missing state lands.

    ``contributing_mappings`` is the CROSS-SOURCE slot: a composed profile
    whose composition declares ``field_sources`` bindings ships each
    contributing source's own mapping document as an additional pinned
    authority, keyed by the binding's ``mapping_role`` --
    ``{role: {"file": name, "sha256": digest}}``.  The front door passes
    each one as ``--contributing-mapping role=path`` so the prepared
    runner can hand ``contributing_mappings`` to the composed decode; the
    composition independently pins the same digest, so a wrong row here
    fails loudly at decode, not quietly.  Only a composed profile may
    declare the slot: a pending profile has no runnable composition to
    bind anything to.  Shipping the row is what lets the front door pass
    the donor table to the prepared runner without the caller supplying
    (or being able to substitute) one.

#: cover it, and on a Windows clone (git-for-Windows defaults

#: so this gate could only ever have been true on one platform: the
