    latitude).  Each block is the band's slice of the dense table with its
    leading ``m0`` all-zero degrees cut off.

    WHY THE CONTRACTION EXPANDS EACH BAND BACK TO DENSE.  OpenBLAS's GEMM
    and GEMV results depend on the operand shapes: the edge-tile kernels
    and the thread partition move with N and K, so a per-order GEMM on the
    packed ``(nlat, T+1-m)`` block does not return the bits the dense
    ``(nlat, T+1)`` one did (measured 2026-09-01: 32 of 64 orders differ
    at T63 float64, every packing granularity up to 32 still differs
    somewhere).  The model's arithmetic identity is pinned on the dense
    contraction, so :meth:`expanded` rebuilds the dense ``(orders, nlat,
    T+1)`` stack for one band at a time in a scratch buffer -- the zeros
    are written, not stored -- and the GEMM reads exactly what it read
    before.  Under numpy that is the same BLAS call per order; under cupy
    one strided-batched GEMM per band.

    THAT IS NOT ENOUGH ON CUPY.  Expanding to dense fixes the OPERANDS,
    and cuBLAS also picks its kernel and tiling by the BATCH count, which
    is the band, and by the GEMM's M, which is the width of the field
    stack being transformed.  MEASURED 2026-09-06 on an RTX 5070 Ti at
    T255 float32: with identical dense operands, band 8 and band 16
    return different bits from band 32 for a stack of one, two, four and
    eight levels, and the same bits at forty.  The one field the dycore
    transforms as a single plane is the surface pressure, so a ten-step
    run at another band ends in another state.  This is why the band is
    in the transform identity above the shipped default, and why a probe
    that sweeps only the band at forty levels reads it as neutral.

        THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE A SECOND CARD TOUCHES THE ANALYSIS.  A
        multi-card run partitions grid space and replicates spectral
        space, so each rank fills the waist rows of the bands it owns and
        the rest arrive here, as the bytes the rank that owns them
        produced.  The contraction that follows then runs at ``K = nlat``
        on a complete waist, exactly as a one-card run does, which is why
        two cards return one card's bits and no pin moves (gate BIT-5).
        The synthesis direction needs no counterpart: it starts from the
        replicated spectral state, so every rank contracts to its own rows
        without a gather, and the wire carries the analysis alone.

        ``transform.row_exchange`` is a duck-typed hook rather than an
        import because ``woof.globe.spectral`` is the layer below
        ``woof.globe`` and must not learn that cards exist; it is
        ``None`` on a single-card run and the branch below is not taken.
