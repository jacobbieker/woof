"""Device and host memory sizing for the WOOF global spectral model.

WHY THIS FILE IS NOT ``woof.core.preflight``.  That estimator itemizes a
WRF-shaped experiment -- per-domain state arrays, per-scheme physics
tables, an RRTMGP column workspace, a shared scratch arena.  A spectral
global model has none of those and has one term nothing regional has: the
Legendre basis tables, which are CUBIC in truncation and are the single
largest allocation of a large run.  So the itemization lives here, next to
the shapes it prices, and only the VERDICT VOCABULARY is shared -- free
VRAM measured the same way, the same other-process margin, the same exit
codes, the same "a leg that cannot be measured never passes" rule.

WHAT THE DEVICE FIGURE IS.  The number the run door prints before a byte
is allocated, and the receipt carries beside the measured one, is the
prediction of a model FITTED TO ALLOCATOR-MEASURED PEAKS: the maximum of
the CuPy default pool's live bytes over a whole run, as the runner's
allocator hook reads it (:mod:`woof.globe.device_memory`), on
runs of the native physics suite with the IMEX SSP3 integrator, the
energy ledger sampled and checkpoints written.  It predicts THAT number
and says so; it is not the working set of the dycore alone.  The model it
replaces (2026-09-01) priced the dycore's arrays against a 7.1 GiB
reading that was itself a sampled, not an allocator, figure: it printed
2.21 GiB at T255 where the allocator measures 8.51 GiB and 10.29 GiB at
T533 where the first probe died past 18.6 GiB.  A door sized by it
admitted every card and refused none that mattered.

THE MODEL.  Seven terms.  The first four are structural -- arithmetic on
the config's shapes, with byte counts read off the code that allocates
them -- and the last three are CALIBRATED against the table
:data:`DEVICE_PEAK_CALIBRATION` by least squares, because they are the
transient working sets of the step (kernel scratch, physics workspaces,
the transform's stacked syntheses, the ledger's samples) and no
itemization of those survives a kernel edit:

1. Legendre tables      3 x packed(T, nlat) x float_itemsize
                        + 3 x band x (T+1) x nlat x float_itemsize
2. spectral state       LIVE_SPECTRAL_STACKS x (14 x nlev + 1)
                        x (T+1)^2 x complex_itemsize
3. surface grid fields  SURFACE_GRID_ARRAYS x nlat x nlon x float_itemsize
4. resident grid fields (RESIDENT_GRID_ARRAYS + GRID_TRACER_ARRAYS)
                        x nlev x nlat x nlon x float_itemsize
5. step working set     W x nlev x nlat x nlon x float_itemsize   (fitted)
6. radiation column     R x nlev x min(radiation_column_chunk, nlat x nlon)
   workspace            x float_itemsize                          (fitted)
7. cumulus column       G x nlev x min(cumulus_column_chunk, nlat x nlon)
   workspace            x float_itemsize                          (fitted)
   plus a fixed F bytes                                           (fitted)

Term 6 is the radiation column chunk's workspace: RRTMGP runs the columns
``radiation_column_chunk`` at a time and its per-g-point arrays are sized
by that chunk, not by the grid, so at T63 (18,432 columns, chunk 12,500)
it is most of the peak.  The radiation call is where the peak sat at
every measured truncation up to T255.  Until 2026-09-05 the cloud
preparation ran BEFORE the chunk loop (``cal_cldfra1`` and
``hydrometeor_paths`` in :mod:`woof.globe.core.rrtmgp`) on the whole grid,
its levelled temporaries priced inside W, and at T533 (1.28 M columns,
chunk 5,000) that full-grid preparation was the peak: the T533 probe of
the morning of 2026-09-05 died inside ``hydrometeor_paths`` at 19.25 GiB
under a 20 GiB pool cap, with 50 and 42 levelled 196 MiB arrays named
there by the allocator tracer, and the same probe of the merged tip
(2d12e0b01) at 19.92 GiB.  The preparation now runs on the solver's own
column chunks (the inputs packed per chunk, the cloud fraction, paths
and sizes formed per chunk into their whole-grid arrays), so the
radiation call at T533 asks 3.07 GiB above its entry where it asked
more than 5.9 and never returned, and the T533 peak moved to the
dynamics' right-hand side (18.56 GiB live on the first step under a
20,992 MiB cap) and, under a 22,528 MiB cap on the merged tip, past the
dynamics into the tracer transport (20.74 GiB live, asking 1.66 GiB) and the
cumulus scheme (18.23).  The T533 probe of record still dies under the
20,992 MiB cap, now in the dynamics and by the pool's fragmentation
rather than by live bytes (:data:`MEASURED_FLOORS`): the free chunks
sit in blocks of the dynamics' own shapes, so handing the pool's cached
blocks back at the step's phase boundaries was tried and refuted (the
dynamics re-grew the pool from 12.4 to 20.3 GiB held inside its own
phase and died at the same place), and T533 stays a floor; every row of
the table was measured on one tree, the merged tip 565b60153 of
2026-09-05 (the chunked preparation, the frozen columns' eleven planes
and the cumulus closure reading all resident), so the table describes
one code.  Without term 6 no single per-column
coefficient fits both ends: the T63 pair (40 and 20 levels) reads 81 MB
per level where the grid arrays account for 12.

Term 7 is the cumulus chunk's workspace, the same shape one chunk size
up: Grell-Freitas packs its columns ``cumulus_column_chunk`` (131,072) at
a time and its per-chunk arrays (the 1,025 MiB and the 16 x nlev x chunk
allocations the tracer names inside ``_cumulus_step`` at T255) grow with
the grid up to that chunk and stop there.  Below the chunk (T63, T127)
they scale like the working set; at and above it (T255 onward) they are
a constant.  Fitted without this term, the three-term model of the
morning of 2026-09-05 read +5.9 percent at T63 and -5.1 percent at T127
against their probes of record, and the excess it had folded into W
carried to T533 as 25.6 GiB where this structure reads 21.6.

``packed(T, nlat)`` is :func:`woof.globe.spectral.legendre.packed_table_
elements`: the tables are stored by bands of orders with the above-
triangle zeros cut off (2026-09-01), so one table is ``(T+1)(T+2)/2 x
nlat`` plus at most ``band - 1`` spare columns per order rather than
``(T+1)^2 x nlat``, and each table's contraction expands one band at a
time into a ``band x (T+1) x nlat`` scratch.  Term 1 is still cubic in
truncation.  That is why a reader whose refusal is tables-bound gets told,
by name, that trimming ``[vertical]`` cannot close it: levels do not
appear in term 1 at all.  Two of the three tables exist after
construction; the derivative table is built by the first gradient, i.e.
the first step, so the runtime figure carries all three.

WHERE THE STRUCTURAL NUMBERS COME FROM.

Terms 1-4 were MEASURED against the artifact on 2026-09-01 and
2026-09-02: the real ``build_transform`` / ``build_model_and_cold_state``
/ ``model.step`` path on the numpy backend, float64, with ``tracemalloc``
filtered to ``numpy.lib.tracemalloc_domain`` so the figure is array bytes
and nothing else.  Six configurations, T21/T31/T42 x nlev 8/12/16,
dealias 1.5.  The coefficients reproduce every one of those six to better
than 0.5%.  Term 1 was re-measured against the packed transform at
T31/T42/T63/T85/T127 in both precisions: it is not fitted, it is the
transform's own byte count.  ``tests/test_arwen_global_sizing.py`` re-takes
that measurement every run.

The numpy backend's step working set is measured directly
(:data:`NUMPY_WORKING_GRID_ARRAYS`, 133.4 array equivalents, a 1.2% spread
across a 5x range of array size) and is a HOST figure: that path opens no
CUDA context and refuses no card.

WHERE THE CALIBRATED NUMBERS COME FROM.  :data:`DEVICE_PEAK_CALIBRATION`
lists every allocator-measured run the fit uses -- truncation, levels,
chunk, the measured peak in bytes, the card and the date -- and
:func:`fit_device_peak_model` solves W, R, G and F from it at import, so
the coefficients cannot be hand-copied beside a table that has since
moved.  :func:`calibration_residuals` reports what the fitted model reads
at each calibration point against what was measured; the door prints the
worst of them beside every prediction.  What the fit does NOT cover is
stated rather than assumed: the native suite at 40 and 20 levels in
float32 at dealias 1.5 with radiation chunks of 12,500 and 5,000 columns
is the measured domain, and a configuration outside it -- another physics
mode, float64, a different dealias factor -- is priced by the same
structure and labelled extrapolated.

WHAT THE FIT IS TRUSTED TO.  Two residuals are printed and they are
different in kind.  The IN-SAMPLE residual is what the fitted model reads
at each row of the table it was solved from.  Rows that share a shape (a
probe and a day of one configuration) contribute the probe-to-day gap
and nothing about the structure, and a table with no more distinct
shapes than coefficients is exactly determined: the table of the morning
of 2026-09-05 -- six rows over four shapes for four coefficients -- read
0.0003 percent at every row by construction and 17 percent at the first
shape measured outside it (T127 at a 5,000-column chunk).  The HELD-OUT
residual (:func:`held_out_residuals`) refits the model with every row of
one shape removed and reads that shape by the refit: it is the error a
shape the table does not contain should expect, and it is the figure a
truncation above the table is labelled with.  On the twelve rows of
2026-09-05 over ten shapes (T63, T127 and T255 at 40 and 20 levels and
at radiation chunks of 12,500 and 5,000, and T255 at 48 levels) the
structure reads every shape within 7.0 percent in sample and 16.1 percent
held out, the T127 shapes
carrying the worst of both (over-read by 7 percent at a 5,000-column
chunk, under-read by 3 to 5 at 12,500); no linear structure of three to six
per-shape regressors tried on those rows did better held out, and a
max-of-phases structure did worse.  A row whose shape is already in the
table tightens the in-sample figure and moves the held-out one only
through the refit, so the table wants NEW SHAPES, not repeats.

THE PROBE OF RECORD.  A day is not needed to read a run's peak, but ten
steps read it only when the radiation is called AGAIN inside them: the
peak sits inside the second radiation call, after a step has left its
state resident, so the ten-step probe of record fires the radiation at
step 0 and step 6 (a 275 s interval at dt 50, 137.5 s at dt 25), samples
the ledger every five steps and writes checkpoints at steps 0, 5 and 10
(:data:`PROBE_RECIPE`).  :data:`PROBE_CALIBRATION` pairs that probe with
a full day on two truncations, in both directions of the instrument:
at T255 the probe reads 9,135,827,456 bytes against the control day's
9,135,851,008 and at T63 3,456,009,728 against the day's 3,456,033,280
(23,552 bytes under at both, 0.0003 and 0.0007 percent), and the same
ten steps with the radiation called once, at step 0, read 7,424,409,088
at T255 and 3,348,668,928 at T63 (18.7 and 3.1 percent under) -- the
recipe the T63 and T127 rows of the first table of 2026-09-05 were
measured with, retired the same day.
:func:`probe_calibration_residuals` re-reads the pairs and the tests
hold them.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT MODEL.  A run's HOST memory during the forecast on the
cupy backend (the device holds the arrays; the host holds the checkpoint
being written), the CUDA context and library workspaces the process holds
outside the pool (measured 2.5 to 3 GB on top of the pool peak at T255),
and the analysis-initialisation decode, which is a mapped-source GRIB read
whose cost belongs to the ingest engine rather than to the spectral model.
The transform-construction host peak IS priced: the recurrence streams
one float64 band at a time, so on the cupy backend the host holds two
float64 band blocks and the per-order solve temporaries and never a whole
table (the dense build held six float64 squares, 9.4 GiB at T533; the
streamed build is priced at 0.21 GiB there).

# What the CARD holds, against what the POOL holds
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Every figure above this line is the CuPy pool's LIVE bytes, because that
# is the quantity the fit was measured on.  A card refuses a run on what
# the CARD holds, and the two differ by two terms this file used to leave
# out of the comparison entirely:
#
#   card held  =  live x fragmentation  +  out-of-pool
#
# FRAGMENTATION is the pool holding blocks it is not lending: it rounds
# every request up to a bin, keeps a freed block in that bin rather than
# returning it, and grows when no bin serves the request.
#
# The OUT-OF-POOL tax is everything on the card the pool never sees: the
# CUDA primary context, the module images, cuBLAS and cuFFT workspaces,
# and the driver's own bookkeeping.
#
# Charging neither is how a run gets admitted and dies: MEASURED
# 2026-09-06 at T533 L40 on a 32 GiB RTX 5090, the door printed 24.45 GiB
# against 30.90 GiB free, admitted the run, and the run reached 27.57 GiB
# LIVE.  Both terms are priced here, each from its own table.
#
# THE TWO TERMS ARE MEASURED AGAINST DIFFERENT THINGS, and charging a
# third would double count.  Fragmentation is pool-held over pool-live;
# the tax is card-held minus pool-held.  Card-held minus pool-LIVE is not
# a third term: it is the sum of these two, and adding it would charge
# the pool's rounding twice.

#: Pool held over pool live, MEASURED on the runs' own receipts
#: (``device_memory.peak_total_bytes`` over ``peak_used_bytes``).
#:
#: ``banded``, ``spilled`` and the radiation ``chunk`` separate the
#: populations, and every one of the three is there because a pair of
#: measurements forced it.
#:
#: Neither the band loop nor the tier moves the ratio one way: T383 L40
#: resident reads x1.1011 and the same shape with all three slices parked
#: at ONE band reads x1.3360, the hardest measured, while the same shape
#: with the tier and EIGHT bands reads x1.0296, the easiest.  A band loop
#: over a tier makes small, uniform allocations that the pool recycles; a
#: whole-globe step staging through a tier makes both kinds at once.
#:
#: The CHUNK moves it too, twice, in the same direction: T383 resident
#: reads x1.1011 at the default 12,500-column radiation chunk and x1.2020
#: at 5,000, and T383 at eight bands with the tier reads x1.0296 at the
#: default and x1.1626 at 5,000.  A smaller chunk takes a gigabyte and a
#: half off the LIVE peak while the pool still grows for the same
#: allocations, so the ratio rises on a run that is smaller.
#:
#: One planning value over all of them would be the largest, and charging
#: that to a banded spilled run at the default chunk refuses the T383
#: forecast this tree completed on a 16 GB card.

#: A MEASURED ROW OF THIS TABLE'S CLASSES THAT IS NOT ITS PLANNING VALUE,
#: and the open question it raises.
#:
#: MEASURED 2026-09-06, RTX 5090, T255 L40 at eight bands with all three
#: slices parked, the ten-step probe of record: 7,317,473,280 B live and
#: 8,308,735,488 held, **x1.13547**, against a "banded with the host tier
#: at the default radiation chunk" class whose largest T383 row is
#: x1.0877.  The same shape and plan on the RTX 5070 Ti read the same
#: 7,317,473,280 B live TO THE BYTE and 8,217,965,568 held, x1.12306, so
#: it is two cards and not one card's accident.  The gate still held on
#: both legs: the door asked 8.73 GiB and nvidia-smi read 8.46 and 8.07
#: GiB against the two processes, because the model's margin and the flat
#: out-of-pool tax cover more than the class's own spread.
#:
#: AND THE SAME PLAN ON TWO CARDS SAYS WHY, which is the finding that
#: matters more than the row.  MEASURED 2026-09-06, T383 L40 at two bands
#: with all three slices parked, which is the plan a bare 34.7 km forecast
#: takes on a 16 GB card: **12,470,658,560 B of pool live on BOTH cards,
#: to the byte**, and 13,564,384,256 B held on the RTX 5070 Ti against
#: 14,826,533,888 B on the RTX 5090.  x1.0877 and x1.18891 for the same
#: plan and the same live bytes.  nvidia-smi read 13,370 MiB against the
#: one process and 14,892 MiB against the other.
#:
#: So fragmentation is not a property of the plan alone: **the pool grows
#: into the room it has**, and a card with twice the room lets it take
#: 1.5 GiB more for the same work.  That has a consequence in each
#: direction, both MEASURED.  Charging the roomy card's x1.18891 to the
#: tight one prices that plan at 15.60 GiB of card against 15.28 GiB free
#: and REFUSES the forecast the 16 GB card completed at 13.06.  Charging
#: the tight card's ratio to the roomy one is what this table did before
#: x1.0877 was added, and it under-read that run's card by 0.117 GiB
#: (14.426 asked, 14.543 held), which is gate MEM-1 failing.  At x1.0877
#: the same leg clears by 0.047 GiB, which is a pass and is not a margin.
#: The term needs an axis for the free VRAM the pool is growing into, and
#: that is a fitted term over more than one pair.  Named here for whoever
#: fits it; the two legs it needs are the same plan measured on the
#: roomy card and on the tight one.
#:
#: It is NOT the planning value, and the reason is the same reason this
#: table has classes at all.  The four T383 rows of that class read
#: x1.0296 to x1.0877; charging a T383 plan the ratio measured on a T255
#: run refuses the bare 34.7 km forecast this tree has completed on a 16
#: GB card whenever that card carries about a gigabyte of anything else
#: (MEASURED: the plan's card figure moves from 14.43 to 15.20 GiB, and
#: the refusal threshold from 14.43 to 14.93 GiB free).  The ratio rises
#: as the run gets smaller, and there are now two pairs saying so -- this
#: one, and the resident class where the smallest shape measured (T63,
#: x1.1668) is the largest row.  Two pairs is the standard the radiation
#: chunk's own axis was added on, so the class may need a size axis; that
#: is a fitted term and it needs more than two pairs, so it is named for
#: the coordinator rather than guessed here.

#: Card held minus pool held, MEASURED: the bytes on the card that the
#: pool never sees -- the CUDA primary context, the module images, and
#: the cuBLAS and cuFFT workspaces.

    ratio for this plan's class, and one phrase saying which rows it came
    from.

    THE CLASS IS THE ALLOCATION PATTERN, and the measurements say it has
    to be.  MEASURED 2026-09-06 across twelve runs of this tree: at the
    default radiation chunk a resident run reads x1.0871 to x1.1668, a
    banded run x1.0695 to x1.1972, a resident run with the pinned tier on
    x1.3360, and a banded run with the tier on x1.0296 to x1.0748; a
    5,000-column radiation chunk moves the resident figure to x1.2020 and
    the banded-with-tier figure to x1.1626, which is why the chunk is part
    of the class.  One planning value over all of them would be the
    largest, and charging x1.3360 to the banded spilled run that
    MEASURED x1.0296 refuses a T383 forecast that this tree completed on
    a 16 GB card with 3.5 GiB to spare.

    The largest of the class, because the term exists to stop a run being
    admitted that the card cannot hold; the middle of a distribution
    would admit half the runs that fail.  A class with no measured row
    falls back to the widest population that has one, and SAYS SO in the
    phrase it returns, so a figure never quietly borrows another class's
    evidence.

    THE BAND COUNT IS PART OF THE PATTERN TOO.  MEASURED 2026-09-07 on
    an RTX 5070 Ti with the physics suite banded: T533 L40 at sixteen
    bands with the tier reads x1.4149, where T383 at eight bands with the
    tier read x1.0296 the day before -- sixteen half-steps a step, each
    allocating and freeing a band's whole working set, leave the pool
    holding bins the eight-band run never opened.  Charging x1.4149 to
    the eight-band T383 run refuses a forecast this tree completed on a
    16 GB card (11.6 GiB live, 12.4 held); charging x1.0296 to the
    sixteen-band T533 run admits one the card holds by 2.9 GiB.  So with
    ``truncation`` given, the rows of the class at that truncation OR
    LARGER are the evidence (a larger grid fragments more, so a smaller
    shape's row would under-charge), and with ``bands`` given, of those
    the rows at that band count OR FEWER (fragmentation grows with the
    count, so a row at fewer bands never over-charges); the largest of
    them is the value.  A shape or count beyond every measured row keeps
    the wider set, and the phrase says which rows spoke.
