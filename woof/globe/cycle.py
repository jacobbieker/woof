"""The in-process cycle door for WOOF global: ``woof global cycle``.

One process alternates the forecast and the assimilation on the resident
device state: the model integrates to each analysis instant, the door's
analysis (:func:`assimilate.analyse`) is formed against the observation
sources at that instant, the analysed state is written as that hour's
analysis checkpoint and the integration continues from it, opening a new
conservation epoch exactly as a restart from an assimilated checkpoint
does.  After the last analysis the forecast runs on to ``until_s`` (the
config's duration by default), writing the ordinary hourly checkpoints.

The per-segment chain this replaces (``run --until-s``, ``assimilate``,
``run --restart`` per hour, each a process) spent most of every model hour
outside the forecast steps: measured on the T255 hourly ASOS cycle on the
RTX 5090 (2026-09-05), 33 s of steps against 12 s of model build and
statics per segment, 13 s of checkpoint write per segment, 7.7 s of model
build plus 4.5 s of checkpoint read in the assimilation process and 211 s
of analysis arithmetic, of which 125 s were forty-level wind syntheses
for a lowest-level operator and 45 s the spreading sums on the host; on
a loaded node the same hour took 10 to 17 minutes.  This door pays the
model build once, keeps the state on the device between the two halves,
names the background by the identity its checkpoint would carry
(:func:`checkpoint.checkpoint_metadata`) instead of writing and reading
it, and publishes the analysis checkpoint off the model thread.

Bit identity with the chain is a contract, not a hope: the analysis is
formed by the one function the file door calls, on a state whose arrays
the file door would have read back unchanged from its checkpoint, and the
new epoch is opened by the same two calls the runner makes on a restart
that carries a chain.  ``tests/test_arwen_global_cycle.py`` holds the
per-segment chain and this door to the same bytes on the smoke
configuration; the T255 proof on the lane's arm is in its report.

    off, a failed gate carries the whole background as the per-segment

    ``filter`` forms the increment (:mod:`woof.globe.da_filter`;
    the deterministic successive correction by default), ``streams`` are
    observation streams (:mod:`woof.globe.da_streams`) fetched for
    each analysis window into ``fetch_dir`` (default ``outdir/fetch``) and
    decoded beside the ``obs_locations`` tables; at least one of the two

    steps through the window (``filter.begin_window`` / ``filter.observe``,

    carries the DA scorecard with its four assessments, the first step
    after every applied analysis is read for its surface-pressure
    tendency against the last step before it (the imbalance reading), and
    the receipt's ``cycle`` record stacks them per cycle with the wall
    budget of every cycle.  ``information_cutoff`` (an instant) drops
    every decoded row whose ``received_time`` lies after it and counts the

    through the observation streams module).  Returns the receipt, the
