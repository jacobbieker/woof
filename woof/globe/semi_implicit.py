"""Semi-implicit treatment of the hydrostatic gravity-wave modes.

Two schemes share one seam (:meth:`linear_tendencies` subtracted from the
explicit right-hand side; ``pre_apply`` / ``post_apply`` integrating
exactly that linear operator by off-centred Crank-Nicolson around the
explicit step, through ``MoistHybridModel.integrate_dynamics``):

* :class:`VerticalModeSemiImplicit` (default) treats EVERY vertical mode
  implicitly through the linear gravity-wave operator of the
  hybrid-coordinate hydrostatic equations about an isothermal reference
  state, derived below in the model's own discrete forms.
* :class:`BarotropicSemiImplicit` treats the external (barotropic) mode
  only through a single reference speed.  It stays selectable for
  identity-locked archives and A/B runs and is bit-identical to its era.

Why the external-only scheme is no longer the default (audit 2026-09-01,
DN-1): it leaves every internal mode explicit, so the rest-state step
ceiling at T533 was 104.7 s regardless of the reference speed and the
advective CFL gate did not bound the step (dt=60 s linearly unstable at
142.7 m/s while the gate tripped at 149.3).  Measured consequence at
250 hPa: more than half the mesoscale kinetic energy beyond ~330 km was
divergent (0.7 at 100-200 km against 0.35-0.45 in GFS/IFS) - explicit,
undamped internal gravity waves.  On the 40-level surface_stretched
default stack the external-only residual is linearly unstable at rest
even at the shipped dt=30 s (growth 7.1e-6 per step at n=257 with the
shipped hyperdiffusion; strict ceiling 1.3 s at T533, 32 s at T21).

The split is subtract-then-integrate (commit 854c97d5f): the explicit
integrator never sees the linear operator, and the corrector never
re-integrates terms the explicit step already carried - applying
Crank-Nicolson on top of a right-hand side that still contained the wave
double-stepped the external mode, and the first real-data T63 run rode
that amplification to 1256 hPa by hour 9.

WHERE the corrector sits matters at a balanced state.  With F(y_b) = 0
the explicit part integrates -L y_b, a tendency as large as the terrain's
own pressure-gradient force, and one Crank-Nicolson step after it does
not undo that beyond first order: at rest over a 2 km mountain (T42,
20-level pressure_blend, the auditor's t6 state, rhs residual 4e-7
m/s^2) the corrector-after-the-step order reaches 2.7 m/s and 3.2 K
within one hour at dt = 60 s under the external proxy (14 m/s, 16.6 K at
dt = 300) and 1.6 m/s, 1.2 K under this operator.  The vertical-mode
scheme therefore applies the SQUARE ROOT of the Crank-Nicolson map on
either side of the explicit step (H R3 H with H^2 = CN, a symmetric
split): same linearized stability as the corrector-after order (the two
are similar matrices; measured ceilings identical to the rung), and the
same hour measures 8e-3 m/s and 0.25 K at dt = 60 s (0.18 m/s, 1.5 K at
dt = 300).  The theta drift that remains scales with dt and is the
first-order split's residual against the reference (DN-2): the per-step
commutator of the coded Jacobian with the reference operator over
terrain.  The default [time] integrator no longer runs this split: the
IMEX Runge-Kutta pair of imex.py advances ``rhs`` (still ``F - L``) and
``L`` with shared abscissae, so every balanced state is an exact fixed
point (the same hour measures 4.2e-4 m/s and 5.5e-4 K at both steps, the
explicit residual's own floor); its solves go through
:meth:`VerticalModeSemiImplicit.solve_shifted`.  The pair was chosen by
measurement on the linearized coded step (ARS(2,3,2) measured unstable
at rest on this operator, 7e-5 per step at T533 dt = 60; the
per-substep IMEX Euler form is exact at rest and unstable under
advection, 2.3e-3 per step at U = 50 m/s; imex.py records the family
and the member).  Under ``integrator = "ssprk3"`` or ``"rk4"`` the
symmetric split below runs bit-identically to its era, and the external
proxy keeps its corrector-after order.

DERIVATION of the vertical-mode operator.  Prognostic variables per
spherical harmonic of total degree n (k^2 = n(n+1)/a^2): divergence D_k,
potential temperature theta_k, ln ps.  Linearized about rest, an
isothermal T_ref, a uniform ps_ref and no rotation, in exactly the discrete
forms the model integrates (dynamics.rhs, vertical.py):

  continuity      ln ps_t = -w . D,          w_k = dp_k / ps_ref
  interface omega omega_j = -sum_{k<j} (dB_k ps_t + dp_k D_k)
  thermodynamic   theta_t = -Gamma D, the flux-form theta tendency of
                  rhs() at the reference profile theta_ref = T_ref /
                  exner: horizontal flux dp theta_ref D, vertical flux
                  omega_j f_j with f_j the interface value of theta_ref
                  reconstructed the way _vertical_scalar_flux_divergence
                  does (van Leer limited, bounded) averaged over the two
                  upstream directions - the central-difference
                  linearization of the coded upwind switch - and the
                  -theta dp_t term.

  The averaged face value is a DOCUMENTED DIVERGENCE from the coded flux.
  The switch is C0: at each interface the code takes the reconstruction
  from the upstream side, chosen by the sign of omega_j, so the operator
  subtracts the mean of two branches neither of which the code integrates
  at any one interface.  Each one-sided branch differs from the average by
  up to 245 K per unit divergence at level 0 on the 20-level pressure_blend
  stack (99% of max|C|) and 63 K on the 40-level surface_stretched default
  (34% of max|C| = 185 K), in the theta rows of the top two layers only
  (the next two levels are 6.8 / 2.2 K and 1.9 / 1.7 K).  Near rest the
  explicit residual is therefore piecewise-linear in the sign of omega,
  with residual speeds sqrt|eig(-B dC)| of 72.6 / 32.4 m/s (20-level) and
  20.7 / 7.7 m/s (40-level) for the two leading residual modes, which the
  explicit step carries inside its advective budget; both one-sided
  branches still give real positive mode spectra (354.9 / 232.3 and 357.6
  / 252.1 m/s for the leading pair on the 20-level stack against the
  averaged 356.2 / 242.6).
  divergence      D_t = k^2 (phi' + R Tv_k factor_k ln ps'), the
                  Laplacian of the Bernoulli geopotential plus the
                  divergence of the pressure-gradient force with
                  factor_k = d ln p_k / d ln ps exactly on the grid
                  (_pressure_gradient_factor), where phi' = G Tv' +
                  R T_ref (1 - factor) ln ps' and G is the model's own
                  hydrostatic integration (Tv linear in ln p over the half
                  layer, DN-3) applied to unit temperature perturbations,
                  and Tv' = exner theta' + kappa T_ref factor ln ps'
                  because theta, not T, is prognostic.

Collecting x = (theta', ln ps'): D_t = k^2 B x, x_t = C D, and the
vertical-structure matrix M = -B C (nlev x nlev) has real positive
eigenvalues c_j^2 (equivalent depths c_j^2 / g).  Checked against the
central-difference Jacobian of the coded rhs at an isothermal rest state:
B to 3.3e-10 and C to 2.5e-15 relative on the 20-level pressure_blend
stack, 2.1e-9 / 4.0e-15 on the 40-level surface_stretched default
(tests/test_arwen_global_vertical_modes.py).  Mode speeds at
T_ref = 320 K: 20-level pressure_blend 356.2 / 242.6 / 149.9 / 97.3 /
68.5 ... m/s (equivalent depths 12935 / 6004 / 2292 / 965 m); 40-level
surface_stretched 354.9 / 227.4 / 151.5 / 109.7 / 84.8 ... m/s (12843 /
5271 / 2340 / 1226 m); the audit's linearization of the 286/220 K column gave
325.4 / 191.5 / 120.7 / 81.2, i.e. the reference operator over-covers
every mode of that column, which is the stability requirement of the
split (a reference slower than the atmosphere's own mode leaves a
residual explicit wave; audit DN-2's 2x2 analysis and the module's
former 450 m/s rule).

The Crank-Nicolson step of L = [[0, k^2 B], [C, 0]] with implicit weight
alpha (0.5 neutral, IFS-style off-centring is alpha = (1 + eps) / 2) is
solved per total degree through the Helmholtz reduction

  (I + alpha^2 dt^2 k^2 M) D^{n+1} = D* + dt k^2 B x*
                                     - alpha (1 - alpha) dt^2 k^2 M D*
  x^{n+1} = x* + dt C [(1 - alpha) D* + alpha D^{n+1}]

with (I + s M)^{-1} = V diag(1 / (1 + s c_j^2)) V^{-1} in the modal
basis - one nlev x nlev matrix per degree, cached per (dt, alpha) - so
every mode receives exactly the scalar off-centred Crank-Nicolson factor
g = (1 + i(1-alpha) c k dt) / (1 - i alpha c k dt): |g| = 1 at alpha =
0.5, < 1 above.  That is :meth:`VerticalModeSemiImplicit.apply`.  The
half map the model runs, H = sqrt(CN), uses that L^2 is block diagonal
(k^2 B C on divergence, k^2 C B on the thermodynamic pair, both with the
modes' -omega_j^2 on the diagonal in their modal bases), so any real
function of L is P + Q L with P, Q functions of L^2: per mode p_j +
i q_j omega_j = sqrt(g_j) (principal root; the null mode of B and degree
zero give p = 1, q = dt/2).  H^2 = CN checked to 2e-15
(:meth:`VerticalModeSemiImplicit.half_apply`).

Reference temperature (fixed by measurement).  The instrument is the
linearized rest ceiling of the coded step (H R3 H with H = sqrt of the
off-centred Crank-Nicolson map, alpha = 0.5, the whole-rhs Jacobian
rescaled by k^2) over four columns with surface temperature 286 / 300 /
320 / 340 K linear in ln p to 220 K; the rule is to maximize the MINIMUM
over those columns, which requires the reference to over-cover every
column's external mode: a colder reference collapses once a column's
external mode outruns it, a warmer one enlarges the explicit residual of
the first-order split (DN-2).

  20-level pressure_blend, T533, no diffusion: T_ref = 300 K gives 572 /
  564 / 591 / 273 s, 320 K gives 449 / 501 / 498 / 523 s, 350 K gives
  292 / 366 / 426 / 426 s (with the shipped hyperdiffusion, min over
  degrees: 445 / 602 / 606 / 639 s at 320 K).
  40-level surface_stretched (the default stack), T533, no diffusion:
  280 K gives 1818 / 366 / 234 / 186 s, 300 K 831 / 1136 / 397 / 242 s,
  320 K 400 / 669 / 1006 / 437 s, 340 K 280 / 376 / 717 / 912 s, 350 K
  246 / 315 / 522 / 758 s; with the shipped hyperdiffusion (order 4,
  14400 s at truncation, min over degrees) the minima are 186 / 242 /
  395 / 276 / 243 s.  T255 scales by k at rest: 320 K gives 835 / 1397 /
  2100 / 912 s (868 s minimum with diffusion) against 504 s at 300 K.

320 K maximizes the minimum on both stacks (400 s on the default against
242 s at 300 K, where the 340 K column's external mode at 350.4 m/s
outruns the 300 K operator's 343.6; the 320 K operator's 354.9 covers all
four).  On the 286 K column alone the ordering reverses (831 / 400 / 246 s
at 300 / 320 / 350 K on the default stack, 572 / 449 / 292 on the
20-level): that is the single-column reading, not the rule, and a
reference tuned to it would leave every warmer column with an explicit
residual wave.  The external-only scheme measures 100.8 s on every column
of the 20-level ladder and 1.3 s on the default stack.
