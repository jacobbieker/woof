"""Carrying a vector from its departure point to its arrival point.

A scalar interpolated at a departure point is the answer.  A VECTOR is
not: the three geocentric Cartesian components read at the departure
point describe a vector that lies in the tangent plane THERE, and the
arrival point's tangent plane is a different one.  Dropping the
difference by projecting is not free, and the size of what it drops is
measurable: a 34.4 km displacement (T255, dt = 300 s, MEASURED
2026-09-06 on a real state) tilts the plane by 5.4e-3 rad, and a plain
projection would shorten the wind by 1 - cos(5.4e-3) = 1.46e-5 per step,
which over the 288 steps of a forecast day is 4.2e-3 of the wind removed
by nothing but bookkeeping.

The vector is ROTATED instead, by the minimal rotation taking the
departure point to the arrival point.  That rotation is not an
approximation of the physics: the Cartesian momentum equation of a
parcel with no forces on it is ``D V/Dt = -(|V|^2/a) r``, whose solution
is the great circle with the velocity parallel-transported along it, and
the minimal rotation from ``r_D`` to ``r_A`` IS that parallel transport.
So the term the trajectory would otherwise have to carry explicitly is
integrated exactly, and the magnitude of the wind is preserved to the
last bit the arithmetic has.

For unit vectors ``p`` (departure) and ``q`` (arrival),

    R v = v - ((p + q).v / (1 + p.q)) (p + q) + 2 (p.v) q

which sends ``p`` to ``q``, fixes every vector orthogonal to both, and
needs no axis, no angle and no trigonometric reconstruction of either.
Its one singular point is ``p.q = -1``, the antipode; the largest
displacement in the ladder is 0.011 rad.

The projection onto the arrival point's local east-north basis is done in
the same launch, because the caller always wants it: the step assembles
its right-hand side in the local components the vector analysis reads.
