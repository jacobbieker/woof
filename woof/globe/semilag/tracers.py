"""Semi-Lagrangian transport of the ten grid tracers, and its mass fixer.

The condensate species and number moments ride the SAME stencil as the
wind, the thermodynamic variable and the vapour: one departure-point
search and one index-and-weight computation serve every field of the
step, so ten tracers are ten more rows in a batched gather rather than a
second transport scheme with a second time step of its own.

That matters arithmetically as well as in cost.  The shipped flux-form
sweep is sub-cycled to a per-face Courant number of 0.25, and on the
outermost T255 ring, which is 326 m wide, a 10 m/s zonal wind at
dt = 300 s has a Courant number of 9.2 and needs 37 sub-steps; at T533
the same wind on a 75 m ring needs 160.  The flux form does not survive
the step this integrator exists to take.  It is not deleted, and
``transport.py`` is not edited: ``[semilag] tracer_scheme = "flux_form"``
still routes the tracers through it for the arm that compares the two.

What a semi-Lagrangian gather does not do is conserve mass.  It reads a
MIXING RATIO at a point; the layer thickness that mixing ratio is
measured against has changed underneath it, and nothing in the
interpolation knows that.  On top of that the quasi-monotone limiter cuts
the cubic's overshoot at every sharp maximum, and a condensate species is
almost all sharp maxima.

Both effects are MEASURED, on the T255 native arms of 2026-09-06 (the 16 GB host,
dt = 300 s, the full native suite).  The two arm sets run the tree's two
cases and the numbers below are not two points on one run: the six-hour
arms are the GDAS 2026-08-30 18Z case
(configs/verify/arwen_global_gdas_t255_native_sl_si_6h.toml) and the
forecast day is the GDAS 2026-09-01 00Z case.  The largest per-step
relative mass the fixer had to move was 5.96e-2 over six hours and 1.01e-1
over the forecast day, and the six-hour arm with the limiter TURNED OFF
reads 6.43e-2, which is the same number as the six-hour arm with it on.

That equality is the finding, and it took fixing the defect below to see
it.  The mass is not the limiter's; it is POSITIVITY's.  A cubic through a
field that is zero at three of its four stencil points undershoots below
zero on the shoulder of every maximum, and something has to lift it back,
because a negative mixing ratio is not a state this model has.  Turning
the limiter off does not stop the lift, it moves it: the negatives arrive
at the fixer's own floor instead of at the gather's clip, and the same
mass is created either way.  Turning BOTH off does stop it, and the run is
then refused at its first step on a cloud water of -1.49e-5 against a
maximum of 1.02e-3.

So the fixer's magnitude is the ADVECTION's error, it is the same to two
figures under every form below, and what separates the forms is not how
much they move but where they put it:

``bermejo_conde_additive``
    Two stages.  First the clip deficit, the signed mass the limiter moved
    at every point, which the gather reports at no extra arithmetic: the
    correction goes back exactly there, scaled by one global number and
    capped so it can never over-restore past the raw interpolated value or
    drive a point negative.  Whatever is left over closes multiplicatively
    as below.  MEASURED on the same arms: that stage carries 1 to 6
    percent of the correction under the default physics coupling and 100
    percent under ``physics_coupling = "arrival"``, where the correction is
    an ADDITION and the deficit points the right way.  The reason it is
    small under the default is the direction above: the limiter's mass came
    from lifting points to zero, and a point that now holds exactly zero
    cannot give any of it back without going negative.
``bermejo_conde`` (default)
    The multiplicative form alone: one uniform RELATIVE adjustment of the
    air that holds the species, weighted by the mass already present.
    Conservative, and it reshapes the field by its own weighting rather
    than by the flow.  On a non-negative field it IS the additive form
    with mass-proportional weights, because ``q (1 + d/W)`` is
    ``q + d q/W``; what the additive stage above adds is not a different
    algebra but a different WEIGHT, the clip deficit in place of the
    mass.  It is the default because the additive stage's
    measured share does not pay for the second device array per gathered
    tracer that reporting the deficit costs; it ships selectable with that
    number rather than being left unbuilt.
``proportional`` is RETIRED and refused by name.  It weighted the
correction by the signed advected value where ``bermejo_conde`` weights
it by the positive part, and once the positivity floor moved in front of
the mass measurement the two weightings became the same array at every
point of every field: MEASURED 2026-09-06 on the numpy path, bitwise
identical output with the limiter on AND off, on a spiky field and on a
cloudy one.  A door whose two values produce the same run and two
different config hashes is the flag-parsed-and-ignored failure this
package refuses everywhere else, so it is refused here rather than left
selectable.

All three floor the advected field at zero BEFORE they measure it, and
report the mass that floor created per species.  A negative mixing ratio
is not a state the model has, so the floor is not optional; measuring the
mass after it is what makes the correction close.

The refusal in the middle of both names its breakage.  A species whose
entire mass has left the model cannot have that mass restored by a
weighted fixer, and a fixer that fell back to spreading it uniformly
would create the mass in clear air, which is precisely the failure the
level-wide spectral rescale used to have: 37 percent of the planet's
cloud water moved out of its columns on every positivity pass, four per
step, and grid-scale precipitation never reached the ground (the pin
document's ``water_repair`` v6 entry).
