"""Three-dimensional interpolation at semi-Lagrangian departure points.

One :class:`Stencil` describes where every arrival point came from; every
advected field is then read at those points through the same index and weight
computation.  The stencil carries the departure COORDINATES rather than
twelve precomputed weights per point, for two reasons and both are measured:
twelve float32 weights plus three base indices is 566 MiB at T255 and 2.46 GiB
at T533 against 141 MiB and 616 MiB for three coordinate arrays, and the
kernel that made the cost model computes the weights once per point and reuses
them across all fourteen fields inside one launch anyway, so writing them to
memory would be the only time they were ever stored.

Directions, and what each one's weights are:

*   Zonal.  ``lon[i] = i*2*pi/nlon`` is uniform, so the weights are the
    equispaced cubic Lagrange weights and the stencil wraps modulo nlon.  It
    is never clamped: there is no zonal boundary.
*   Meridional.  The latitudes are Gauss-Legendre nodes and are NOT uniform,
    so the weights are the general four-point Lagrange weights on the actual
    node latitudes, built from a precomputed table of reciprocal
    denominators.  Treating them as equispaced is exact for no cubic at all
    and shows up first as a hemispherically antisymmetric error, which is
    why KERN-1 runs at a rotation angle of pi/2.  A departure point poleward
    of the outermost ring reads the reflected rows described in
    :mod:`woof.globe.semilag.tables`.
*   Vertical.  Four-point cubic Lagrange in the continuous level index, full
    level ``k`` at index ``k``, with the departure index clamped to the data
    range ``[0, nlev-1]`` and the stencil start clamped to ``[0, nlev-4]``,
    so the four levels nearest a boundary use the one-sided cubic through
    them.  The clamp names its breakage: a departure point above the model
    lid has no data there, and extrapolating instead of clamping would make
    unbounded values exactly where the top sponge already has a rigid-lid
    reflection to fight.

All three weight sets are normalized by their own sum.  That is what makes
the zero-displacement identity exact, at every point of the grid including
the polar rows and the vertical boundaries: at a grid point three of the four
Lagrange weights are exactly zero and the fourth is divided by itself.

Two horizontal widths.  ``order = 4`` is the tricubic gather above, the one
every kernel gate of record was measured on, and its arithmetic does not
move.  ``order = 6`` is the QUINTIC-horizontal gather: six-point Lagrange
weights in the zonal and meridional directions on the six-point tables
(three reflected rows beyond each pole) and the same four-point cubic in the
vertical.  It exists because an interpolation is a filter applied once per
step whatever the step is: MEASURED 2026-09-06 on the T255 forecast day at
dt = 300 s, the cubic gather kept 17 percent of the Eulerian core's 500 hPa
vorticity power at total wavenumbers 181 to 230 and 49 to 71 percent above
n = 60, and the four-point weights at a fifth of a cell lose 7.6 percent of
a 3.8-cell wave's amplitude per pass.  The six-point weights halve that
loss at the same cost in trajectory and tables and 2.25 times the taps.
The dynamical bundle reads it; the limited species keep the cubic, whose
limiter box is the same inner cell either way.
