"""The seam where this package meets an engine that is not quite there yet.

The carve measured this distribution's boundary symbol by symbol against the
engine it depends on.  `tools/measure_boundary.py` is that measurement and it
is re-run rather than transcribed, because a count in a docstring ages: this
one said eighty-two while the tool said seventy-six, and said four while the
list under it had five entries and `GAPS` below had six rows.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS NOW, AND WHAT IT STOPPED BEING.  Until 2026-09-09 it
carried a contract, forwarded to two float64 reference functions and refused
five signatures, because the physics this model was graded with sat in a
source tree and the published engine had a different one.  That is no longer
a gap to stand in: the modules and kernels the model executes are CARRIED, in
`woof.globe.core`, cut from the tree the model was graded in.  A carried
callable's signature is this package's own, and no installed engine can
present a different one, so the five signature refusals and the YSU
mixing-length contract are retired -- not weakened, retired, because a guard
whose defect is fixed teaches a reader to expect a failure that cannot
happen.

What remains is what the carve genuinely left on the engine's side:

    woof.core.preflight.measured_free_vram_bytes
    woof.verify.harness.surface_bias.interpolate_to_tape
    woof.mapped_source.decode_mapped_source(scratch_destination=...)

They are patch items the engine has to carry, and the carve wrote the series
out for the engine's owner.

THE RULE, and it is the same one `woof.globe.obs_doors` follows: the ENGINE
IS ASKED FIRST, every time, for every symbol.  Nothing here shadows a symbol
the engine has.  `tests/test_engine_compat.py` fails the day the engine grows
one, which is how the shim retires itself instead of quietly becoming a fork.

A COMPUTATION IS REFUSED, never reimplemented.  `measured_free_vram_bytes`
measures a card and `interpolate_to_tape` interpolates a reference field.
Reimplementing either here would produce a SECOND instrument answering the
same question, and a second instrument that disagrees with the first is worse
than no answer: the number would be reported with the same confidence and be
wrong in a way nobody could see.  So each one refuses by name, says which
command it stops, and names the engine change that fixes it.

A CARRY IS NOT A REFUSAL AND NOT A STAND-IN.  The distinction matters because
the three mechanisms fail differently.  A refusal stops a command.  A stand-in
answers with this package's copy of somebody else's value.  A carry means the
code is HERE and runs, and what the engine still supplies underneath it is
pinned in `woof/globe/data/engine-seam.json` and reported file by file by
the doctor.

#:
#: MEASURED 2026-09-07 with `tools/measure_engine_signatures.py` between the
#: tree this package was carved from and a published 2.7.0: eighteen callables
#: differ and eight do not accept an argument this package passes.  Seven of
#: the eight were physics, and the carve took all seven into
#: `woof.globe.core` on 2026-09-09 -- the surface layer's `vegfra`,
#: radiation's `column_size_bounding`, both cumulus constructors'
#: `column_chunk`, the YSU launcher's mixing-length flag and the two float64
#: mirrors' keywords -- so their rows are gone from this table rather than
#: standing as guards against a thing that can no longer happen.
#:
#: THE EIGHTH WAS THE SOURCES SEAM and it was translated rather than carried.
#: `woof.mapped_source.decode_mapped_source` used to be a row.  Its missing
#: `scratch_destination` keyword named WHERE the decoder stages its frame
#: stream, and a published engine places the same scratch by
#: `WOOF_COMPOSE_SCRATCH` -- two spellings of one placement, so
#: `woof.globe.mapped_source_compat` translates between them, under one
#: lock, and records in the receipt which of the two placed the directory.
#: A row that is adaptable without changing what a run does is not a refusal.
#:
#: SO THE TABLE IS EMPTY, and that is the measurement rather than an
#: omission: against a published 2.7.0 there is no call this package makes
#: that the installed engine refuses.  The mechanism stays because the
#: question does not go away -- an engine inside `>=2.8.0,<2.9` can still
#: move a signature underneath the seam -- and a row added here is refused at
#: the door by name, before a run prices a card.  `tools/measure_engine_signatures.py`
#: is what finds the next one.
