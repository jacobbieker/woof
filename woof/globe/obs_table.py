"""Neutral point-observation table and table-declared cache decoders.

The observation layer is ONE neutral table.  Every observation is a row
``(source, station_id, latitude, longitude, elevation, level, valid_time,
variable, value, error)`` in the small neutral variable vocabulary below.
A stream joins the system by declaring a :class:`SourceDecoder` TABLE ENTRY:
which header columns identify the stream, which columns feed which neutral
variable through which NAMED conversion from the fixed vocabulary.  The
decode engine is source-agnostic; a new source is a new table entry, never a
new code path.

Sources are fetched by URL or local file path identically, gzip or plain.

The cache files are PRE-DECODED tables: the upstream service already parsed
each raw report into columns, so this module reads tables and never parses a
raw METAR or aircraft report.  The production route for raw-report decode is
an rw-obs Rust decoder behind the obs front-door ladder; this reader is the
research seam for the pre-decoded cache streams.

The neutral table as a file
---------------------------
The Rust observation front doors of the global data assimilation
(``rw_igra2``, ``rw_amv``, ``rw_ndbc``, ``rw_gnssro``, ``rw_asos table``;
``tools/rustwx/crates/rw-obs/src/table.rs``) write this module's own
vocabulary straight to disk as ``gpuwm-obs.table.v2``
(:data:`TABLE_HEADER`): the ten v1 columns above followed by the five
causal-bookkeeping columns ``measurement, nominal_time, published_time,
received_time, revision``.  :func:`decode_neutral_csv` reads a v2 file and
a v1 file (:data:`TABLE_HEADER_V1`, the extras empty) without conversion,
and :func:`decode_obs_csv` recognises either header before it consults the
declared source tables, so every door of the tree that calls
:func:`load_obs` takes these files unchanged.  The bookkeeping columns say
what a number is (:data:`MEASUREMENT_TABLE`: a station pressure recovered
from an altimeter setting is not a reduced sea-level pressure), which
synoptic hour a report is filed under, when its source published it, when
this system first held it, and which source object it came from; a row
whose receipt time is empty is a report whose arrival was not recorded
and is labelled latency unverified by the streams module.
