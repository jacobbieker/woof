"""How a physics suite's per-band readings become the globe's.

The physics half-step runs the suite one latitude band at a time
(``dynamics.MoistHybridModel.apply_physics``): every band returns a
:class:`~woof.globe.physics.exchange.PhysicsResult` of its own
rows, and what the step reports for the call is assembled here.  Three
kinds of reading exist, and each has exactly one merge that makes the
answer independent of the band count:

- a reading that is the SAME on every band (a call counter, a schedule
  flag, a config-derived string) is checked equal across the bands and
  refused by name when it is not, because a per-call reading that differs
  between bands is a band leaking into arithmetic that must not see it;
- an EXACTLY associative reading (a maximum, a minimum, an integer count)
  folds across the bands in any order;
- a reading that is a flat reduction over a horizontal plane (a grid
  mean, a path sum) is NOT merged from the bands' scalars at all: the
  suite hands the plane back unreduced (``PhysicsResult.planes``), the
  caller assembles the whole plane, and the suite's ``finish`` reduces it
  once -- the same operand in the same order whatever the schedule was.

A floating-point SUM across bands is refused: folded band by band it is a
different number for a different band count, which is the whole thing
this module exists to prevent.  Integer-valued counts carried as floats
(a column count) are exact and are the one sum admitted, under ``count``.
