"""Observation scorecard for WOOF global: the run, a control and the GFS
forecast read the same way against MEASURED observations, never against an
analysis.

What it measures
----------------
Two instruments, one sampling rule.

*Surface.*  ASOS station reports (the ``gpuwm-obs.asos-surface.v2`` or ``.v1`` record
``rw_asos`` decodes, or -- ``--obs-source dynamical-asos`` -- the same record fetched
from the Dynamical.org ASOS Parquet archive for the models' own box, so stations
anywhere that archive has them are scored; the provenance and its attribution
travel in the result) at one valid time, four variables in the seam's units:
2 m temperature (K), 2 m dewpoint (K), 10 m wind speed (m/s) and mean sea
level pressure (Pa; the tables print hPa).  Every model is a
:class:`SurfaceFields`: its 2 m temperature and specific humidity, 10 m wind
components, surface pressure, terrain height and land mask on its own
rectilinear latitude-longitude grid.  The station set is admitted by the
verification library's own rule (:func:`woof.verify.obs.stations.
freeze_station_set`: land at the nearest cell, model terrain within the
registered tolerance of the station elevation, the gross-error screen and
the reporting fraction) with EACH model's own land mask and terrain, and
the scored set is the INTERSECTION of the admitted sets, so every model
meets the same stations and the same report.  A station where any model's
stencil is refused leaves that variable for every model.  The model value
is bilinear in latitude and longitude on the model's own grid
(:class:`RectilinearSampler`); the residual is model minus observation; the
rows are n, bias, rmse and mae.

*Upper air.*  Radiosonde mandatory levels from the IGRA2 year-to-date
archive (:func:`parse_igra2`), at the nominal 00Z and 12Z hours: 500 hPa
geopotential height (m), 850 and 500 hPa temperature (K), and the vector
wind at 250 and 850 hPa (m/s: root-mean-square vector error, wind-speed
bias, u and v biases).  The run's fields come from the upper-air
scorecard's own column interpolation (linear in ln p between the bracketing
full levels, geopotential hydrostatic, below-ground targets refused per
column) on the Gaussian grid; the GFS fields are the product's own isobaric
levels on its 0.25 degree grid, refused where the product's surface pressure
sits below the level.  Both are then sampled at the site bilinearly in
latitude and longitude; a site whose stencil touches a refused column is
refused for every model at that level.  Rows by hemisphere: ``nh`` is
latitude >= 0, ``sh`` latitude < 0, ``global`` everything.

How the two models are sampled differently (stated, not hidden)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Our 2 m temperature and specific humidity are the physics suite's
  SFCDIAGS books on land (T2 = TSK - HFX / (rho cp CHS2), Q2 from the
  moisture flux) and the surface layer's bulk profile over water
  (``physics__t2``, ``physics__q2`` in the checkpoint); the GFS 2 m fields
  are diagnosed by the GFS's own surface scheme inside the GFS and written
  to the product.  Each model's 2 m value is the model's own claim about
  2 m; nothing is re-diagnosed here.
* Our 10 m wind is the surface layer's (``physics__u10``, ``physics__v10``);
  the GFS's is its 10 m product field.
* Our terrain is the analysis orography the run integrated with (regridded
  to the Gaussian grid and spectrally truncated, ``phi_s / g`` with the
  model's g 9.80616); the GFS terrain is the product's surface height in gpm.
  The terrain-mismatch admission uses each model's own terrain, so the
  admitted sets differ (the truncated T255 orography is smoother than the
  0.25 degree GFS terrain); the intersection is what is scored.
* Dewpoint is derived on BOTH sides from 2 m specific humidity and surface
  pressure with one formula (Bolton 1980, ``surface_energy.
  dewpoint_from_specific_humidity``), never read from a product dewpoint.
* Mean sea level pressure is reduced on BOTH sides with one formula, the
  scoring chain of record's (``tools/arwen_global_bias_vs_gfs.py``):
  ``p_msl = p_s exp(g h / (R (T2 + 0.0065 h / 2)))`` with g 9.80665 and
  R 287.05.  The GFS product's own PRMSL is not read.  The station's own
  reduction is the ASOS algorithm's.
* Our grid is Gaussian (T255: 384 rows, 768 columns, about 0.47 degree);
  the GFS product's is 0.25 degree.  Bilinear sampling on each model's own
  grid means the GFS is read at roughly twice our resolution; no field is
  regridded before sampling.
* Geopotential height: ours is ``phi / g`` with g 9.80616; the GFS product's
  is gpm (g0 9.80665); IGRA2 reports geopotential metres.  At 500 hPa the
  constants differ by 0.27 m of thickness, well below the rows' rmse.
* A sounding is valid at its nominal hour; the balloon is released up to
  an hour before it and reaches 500 hPa about 20 minutes after release.
  Both models are read at the nominal hour.

Calibration (``python -m woof.globe.obs_scorecard calibrate``;
``tests/test_arwen_global_obs_scorecard.py`` holds every bar): the
families in CALIBRATION below are planted in both directions.

Recorded 2026-09-05 on the CPU test host (Python 3.14, numpy 2.5, float64)
by `calibrate`; the test file holds every bar.  Grids: the T21 Gaussian
grid (33 x 66, rows ascending from the south) and a regular 1 degree grid
with rows descending from the north (the product's order), both periodic
in longitude.

Family S1, the sampler against a closed form: a field 3 + 0.7 lat - 0.02 lon
at 400 random points that never cross the longitude seam reads the closed
form to 1.4e-14 on both grids (bar 1e-12); 40 points inside the seam cell
(between the last column and the first) read the four-corner hand
computation to 7.1e-15 (Gaussian) and 0 (regular); the library's
index-space bilinear (woof.verify.obs.stations.sample_field) and this
sampler agree to 8.9e-16 at 400 points on the regular grid; a point
poleward of the first Gaussian row is refused (NaN); a point whose stencil
touches one NaN cell is refused while the clean cell beside it reads 1.0.

Family S2, a model against itself: pseudo-observations equal to the model's
own samples at 300 stations score bias 0, rmse 0, mae 0 exactly for every
surface variable (the intersection with a second model on the regular grid
keeps all 300), and at 200 sites every upper-air target reads exactly 0
(rmsve 0, every wind bias 0).

Family S3, planted differences (observation = model sample + delta; the
row reads model minus observation):

    z500 +12 m plus a zero-mean texture of rms 5 m: bias -12.000, rmse 13.000 (2e-14 off)

Family S4, the two derived fields: dewpoint from specific humidity and back
through Bolton's saturation vapour pressure round-trips to 0.0 K over 233
to 313 K; a station at terrain 0 reads mean sea level pressure equal to
surface pressure exactly, and terrain 1000 m at T2 288.15 K reads the chain
of record's closed form to 0.0 Pa.

Family S5, the IGRA2 record: a synthetic two-sounding file in the archive's
own fixed columns (verified against the archive's 2026-09-01 12Z records)
reads back z850 1512 m, t850 294.35 K, u850 +10 / v850 0 (270 degrees,
10 m/s), z500 5860 m, t500 262.65 K, u500 0 / v500 -5 (360 degrees, 5 m/s)
to 2e-15; a -9999 height and temperature read None with the 30 m/s wind
speed beside them kept; no 700 hPa row reads None; a 12Z filter keeps one
of the two soundings.

Family S6, refusals by name: a checkpoint lacking physics__t2 refuses
naming physics__t2 (and every other missing array); a decoded product
lacking specific_humidity_2m refuses naming it; a product without an
850 hPa level refuses naming the level.

Family S7, admission parity: the fractional positions this sampler hands
the admission library on the regular grid equal the direct index formula
to 0 (x) and 1.4e-14 (y), and the library admits the same station set from
either.
