"""``woof global da``: the data-assimilation door of WOOF global.

Five legs, one receipt (:data:`DA_RECEIPT_NAME`, schema
:data:`DA_RECEIPT_SCHEMA`) beside whatever the leg wrote:

``init``
    Build the ensemble from an analysis: the deterministic state (a
    checkpoint given, or the config's cold start written as step 0) and
    the filter's members, recorded in the ensemble manifest
    (:mod:`woof.globe.da_filter`).

``cycle``
    The hourly cycle (:func:`woof.globe.cycle.cycle`): fetch the
    streams for each window, quality control, analyse through the filter,
    write the deterministic analysis checkpoint and the ensemble manifest,
    a report per cycle with O-B and O-A per stream, variable and region
    (the DA scorecard) and the wall budget of every cycle.

``analyze``
    One analysis at a stated instant from stated observation tables into a
    checkpoint (the file door of :mod:`woof.globe.assimilate`),
    with its scorecard printed.

``fresh``
    The one command: fetch the newest analysis (GDAS through the tree's
    fetch door, or a GRIB on disk), derive the run configuration from a
    base TOML, ``init`` if no ensemble exists in the output, ``cycle``
    hourly through every stream up to the newest observation hour, and
    hand back the analysis checkpoint the forecast starts from.

``forecast``
    The forecast from an analysis checkpoint (the runner's restart).

Every analysis carries its lineage in the checkpoint (the assimilation
chain: instant, background identity, filter, streams) and in the report;
the receipt names the checkpoint handed back with its digest, so the
forecast door and the scorecards read the same object.

Interface decisions (the door builds against the ensemble lane's filter
and the observations lane's streams through code, not assumptions):

* the filter interface is :mod:`woof.globe.da_filter`'s
  (``resident_states`` / ``analyse`` / ``init`` / ``manifest``); the
  deterministic successive correction is the filter in this tree and the
  default; ``letkf`` refuses by name until the ensemble lane lands;
* a stream is a :data:`woof.globe.da_streams.STREAM_TABLE` entry
  whose fetch lands files an obs-table decoder entry reads; the door
  fetches each stream for ``(analysis time - interval, analysis time]``
  and records URL or path, bytes, SHA-256, wall and latency behind real
  time in the fetch manifest and the report;
* the observation vocabulary is :data:`woof.globe.obs_table.
  VARIABLE_TABLE`; the scorecard groups by the row's ``source``;
* the analysis checkpoint is the runner's own checkpoint format (schema
  v3) with the chain in the physics metadata; the ensemble manifest names
  the member checkpoints beside it;
* the receipt's gate is engineering validity (design amendment G): a
  stream whose rows never reached the operators or has no O-A is
  INCOMPLETE; O-A against O-B, the Desroziers reading and the withheld
  rows are assessments the receipt carries, never a gate;
* the control member gets its own analysis through the ensemble
  covariance (amendment A, :mod:`woof.globe.da_control`), the
  transfer is tapered and inspected (C), reports are compared at their
  own bin instants (B, ``--observation-bin-s``), the external analysis is
  a weak low-pass constraint (E, ``--anchor``), RTPS is the one inflation
  by default (D), the increment may be inserted incrementally (D,
  ``--increment-application iau``), and ``fresh`` states its information
  cutoff (F, ``--cutoff-utc``).
