# The mass/water drift gates compare post-fix means against the very targets
# the fixers reset every step, so they cannot see a conservation leak while
# the fixers are on. These budgets gate what the fixers and the physics local
# water repair ABSORBED, per step, so an unbounded leak fails the run even
# while the fixers hold the mean. The limits are per-precision because the
# healthy ceiling is arithmetic roundoff and roundoff scales with the float:
#
# float64, measured on the six-hour T7 reference campaign (360 steps,
# conservative physics, exchange-clamp closure): mass fixer |log offset|
# <= 1.64e-7, water fixer <= 3.9e-8 relative, physics local repair
# <= 1.14e-13 kg/m2.
#
# float32, measured on the six-hour T63 GDAS canary on the RTX 5090
# (72 steps, 2026-08-31): 4.14e-5, 1.51e-6 relative, and 1.22e-4 kg/m2 -
# that last is exactly 2^-13, the fp32 ulp of the ~500 kg/m2 ledger.
#
# The leaks these exist to catch measured 5e-3 (0.5%/step surface-pressure
# sink), 2.4e-4 relative/step (1%-per-call qv deletion), and 8.2e-4
# kg/m2/step (the unfixed diffusion operator) - every limit sits >=4x above
# its precision's measured healthy ceiling and remains below the leak scale.
#
# These envelopes were measured on the REFERENCE suite, whose exchange-clamp
# closure has no kernel-internal error channel.  (They were measured under
# the v4 uniform reservoir levy; under the v5 atmosphere-internal fixer the
# clamps no longer move water between reservoir and atmosphere, so the water
# fixer absorbs only transport/projection residuals - audit 2026-09-01
# VTW-1.)  The arwen-native suite does:
# Morrison's rainncv is credited 1:1 to the reservoir while the kernel's own
# fp32 sedimentation/process arithmetic sets the actual column debit, and the
# post-kernel negative-species clamp silently creates up to ~1e-7 kg/kg per
# level-species.  Both are genuine fp32 accumulation, not booking routes
# (CPU repro water-repair-262, 2026-09-01: every Noah/PBL booking route
# settles to <=2x2^-14 by construction), so a native run config may carry its
# own MEASURED gates.physics_water_repair_max_step_kg_m2 - the config-level
# override below - with the measurement and sizing arithmetic quoted in the
# config.  Reference configs keep this envelope.

# paid back from their own vapor that step.  Under the v5 per-level global

#: Per-step correction the semi-Lagrangian tracer fixer may make, as a
#: fraction of the atmosphere's OWN column water.
#:
#: This is the number the breakage is about.  A tracer scheme that is not
#: conservative silently loses or gains water over a forecast day, which
#: is the class of defect the grid tracers were introduced to retire, and
#: what says whether that is happening is how much water the fixer has to
#: put back, not how large that is beside one trace species' own mass.
#:
#: Priced from measurement, not from an estimate.  MEASURED 2026-09-06,
#: the 16 GB host RTX 5070 Ti, T255 L40 with the full native suite at dt = 300 s:
#: 3.44e-5 over a whole forecast day (288 steps) from the GDAS 2026-09-01
#: 00Z analysis, and 2.17e-5 over the six-hour arms, which run the OTHER
#: case this tree carries (GDAS 2026-08-30 18Z,
#: configs/verify/arwen_global_gdas_t255_native_sl_si_6h.toml) -- two
#: initial states, named because a reading of six hours and a reading of a
#: day here are not two points on one run.  The six-hour number is the same
#: 2.17e-5 whichever form the fixer runs, because it is the ADVECTION's
#: error and not the fixer's.  The limit is 1e-4, three times the day's
#: reading.
#:
#: It interlocks with the two water gates rather than duplicating them.  A
#: run sitting at this limit with every correction the same sign would move
#: 2.9 percent of the column over 288 steps, which
#: ``total_water_relative_drift`` (1e-3) would refuse; a run that hid it in
#: the surface reservoir instead would be refused by
#: ``water_fixer_max_step_relative``.  What this row adds is the reading
#: BEFORE either of those absorbs it, so a scheme whose water error is
#: growing is visible while it is still being closed.
SEMILAG_TRACER_FIXER_WATER_RELATIVE_LIMIT = 1.0e-4

#: Per-step relative mass the fixer may move within ONE species.  This is
#: an accuracy diagnostic of the advection, not a conservation gate: the
#: fixer closes the mass either way, and what a large value says is that
#: the species' field is being shaped by the fixer's weighting as much as
#: by the flow.
#:
#: Read what the number is before reading the limit.  ``fix_mass``
#: computes it as ``|mass(before) - mass(advected)| / mass(before)`` on
#: the field the gather produced and BEFORE any correction is applied,
#: and it computes it for every scheme including ``"none"``.  So it
#: measures the TRANSPORT's mass error and no choice of fixer can move
#: it: the multiplicative form this module ships is, on a non-negative
#: field, algebraically the additive Bermejo-Conde form with
#: mass-proportional weights (``q (1 + d/W) == q + d q/W``), so "take the
#: additive form instead" is not a remedy for this number, it is the same
#: operator.
#:
#: Priced from measurement.  The 1e-4 of the specification of record was an
#: estimate written before the scheme ran; it is off by three orders of
#: magnitude and this is what the arms read.
#:
#: MEASURED 2026-09-06, the 16 GB host, T255 L40 native: 1.01e-1 for graupel over
#: the forecast day (GDAS 2026-09-01 00Z) and 5.96e-2 to 6.35e-2 over the
#: six-hour arms (GDAS 2026-08-30 18Z, the other case), the six-hour
#: reading the same to two figures under every fixer form AND with the
#: quasi-monotone limiter turned off (6.43e-2).  What the number measures
#: is what POSITIVITY costs, not what the limiter costs: a cubic through a
#: field that is zero at three of its four stencil points undershoots
#: below zero on the shoulder of every maximum, something has to lift it
#: back, and turning the limiter off only moves that lift from the
#: gather's clip to the fixer's own floor.  Turning both off stops it and
#: the run is refused at its first step, on a cloud water of -1.49e-5
#: against a maximum of 1.02e-3.
#:
#: The limit is 0.25.  Named breakage: a species whose per-step correction
#: approaches its own mass is a species the fixer is placing rather than
#: the flow transporting, and a quarter of it per step is where that
#: begins to be true over the few steps a convective species lives in one
#: column.  2.5 times the day's worst reading.
#:
#: What the number is a function of, so the headroom is not read as an
#: invariant.  MEASURED 2026-09-06 on the numpy specification, a synthetic
#: condensate blob displaced by a third of a cell in each direction on a
#: 40-level stack: the correction falls from 1.35e-1 for a species ONE
#: model layer deep to 1.9e-2 for one ten layers deep, and from 1.16e-1
#: for a blob two cells across to 2.6e-2 for one ten cells across, while
#: the UNLIMITED gather's own mass error stays at 4.6e-3 throughout.  So
#: the reading is what positivity costs FOR A SPECIES A FEW CELLS ACROSS
#: AND ONE TO THREE LAYERS DEEP, which is what a condensate species is at
#: T255 on forty levels; it is not a property of the scheme alone, and a
#: run at a sharper truncation or on a thinner ladder reads higher.  The
#: 2.5x headroom above the T255 L40 day is headroom AT THAT OPERATING
#: POINT and the limit owes a re-reading at T533 and at T799.
