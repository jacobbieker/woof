"""What a configuration's physics ALLOCATES and PUBLISHES -- no runtime.

Configuration predicates and name tables only, split out of
:mod:`woof.globe.core.physics` because that module's body imports cupy and
these answers must not cost a GPU runtime to ask.  The VRAM estimator
(:func:`woof.core.preflight.physics_array_shapes`) is the consumer that
forced the split: ``woof domain`` -- a command that integrates nothing
on a card -- reached ``import cupy`` through this metadata and refused
every CPU-only install, with ``--card`` declared and the answer already
in hand (measured by the 2.5.0 persona walks).

Everything here is re-exported by :mod:`woof.globe.core.physics`, whose
docstrings carry the WRF line-number authority; import from either, but
from HERE when the caller must stay importable without cupy.  The
runtime-free property is held by
``tests/test_wizard_sizing_authority.py``, which runs the wizard in an
