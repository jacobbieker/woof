"""WRF-ordered non-timesplit physics driver.

The driver calls radiation, MM5 surface layer, Noah LSM, YSU PBL, and
cumulus in WRF order before RK3.  Physical tendencies are computed once,
converted from A-grid uncoupled rates to the dry-mass-coupled ARW
slow-tendency form, and held fixed across all three RK stages.  This follows
WRF v4.6.1
``solve_em.F``, ``module_first_rk_step_part1.F``,
``module_em.F:calculate_phy_tend`` and
``module_physics_addtendc.F:phy_bl_ten``.

``radt_minutes``, ``cudt_minutes``, and ``bldt`` use WRF minutes and zero
means every model step.  Each slot follows its own WRF driver predicate:
radiation uses the default-offset ``MOD(ITIMESTEP, STEPRA) == 1`` calendar,
while cumulus and surface/PBL use ``MOD(ITIMESTEP, STEP*) == 0``.  Every
driver also calls on the first step and when its interval is one step.

Cumulus results that carry ``nca_seconds`` additionally follow WRF's
Kain-Fritsch driver persistence (Task 6b): each column holds its stored
tendencies, RAINCV, and PRATEC while its NCA timer has time remaining
(``module_cu_kfeta.F:410-440``), RAINC accumulates ``PRATEC*DT`` on every
model step, and the timer decrements by DT per step with the stored
tendencies cleared near expiry (``solve_em.F:3558-3571`` ->
``module_physics_addtendc.F:2139-2231``).

    WRF v4.6.1 forms ``SR=(SNOWNCV+GRAUPELNCV)/(RAINNCV+1e-12)``.
    The frozen numerator and total-precipitation denominator contain the
    same nonnegative components but associate their binary32 additions
    differently, so an all-frozen column may finish a few ULPs above one.

    For ``L`` WSM6 minor loops, each loop's total uses three additions, the
    snow pair uses one, each carrying accumulation uses ``L-1`` additions,
    and the final numerator and division use one rounding each.  With
    binary32 unit roundoff ``u=2^-24`` and
    ``gamma_n=n*u/(1-n*u)``, the positive-sum bound is

      B = (1+u)^3 (1+gamma_(L-1))
          / ((1-gamma_3) (1-gamma_(L-1))).

    ``step_scalings`` covers a family member whose kernel applies extra
    unit-scale multiplicative operations to BOTH sides of the quotient
    after each step's sums -- WDM6 scales every accumulation step by
    ``delz[0]/1000*dtcld*1000`` (wdm6.cu:618-633, four roundings) where
    WSM6 accumulates pre-scaled sediment returns.  Each such rounding
    moves the numerator up by at most ``(1+u)`` and the denominator down
    by at most ``(1-u)``, so the bound widens by exactly
    ``((1+u)/(1-u))^step_scalings``; at ``step_scalings=0`` the integer
    arithmetic below is unchanged bit for bit.

    The integer arithmetic below evaluates ``floor((B-1)/ULP(1))`` exactly,
    selecting the largest representable binary32 value no greater than the
    analytic bound.  It therefore admits only WRF expression-order roundoff
    and never clips or otherwise changes the scheme's SR field.  The

    FORENSIC FORM, the same one ``validate_sase_tendencies`` already
    carries, and for a reason this scheme learned from a field report
    rather than from theory.  A user on 1.5.2 lost an ERA5 run on its
    FIRST step to ``non-finite dtheta``, and that name is a false lead:
    the kernel writes ``dtheta`` from one solve whose only surface term
    is HFX (kernels/ysu.cu:480), so a non-finite HFX handed IN is
    reported as a dtheta produced OUT.  1.5 million fuzzed columns of
    finite, extreme, degenerate input never produce a non-finite rate at
    all, so when one appears an input is overwhelmingly the cause.  The
    output name alone therefore sent the reader to the PBL scheme when
    the defect was in the surface layer that fed it.  Naming the
    degenerate INPUTS is what closes that gap, and it costs nothing
    until a rate has already failed.

    WHICH output carries the poison depends on surface stability.  The
    input-poisoning sweep that found ``hfx`` was run before the sm_120
    DAZ work, so it was re-run against the shipping kernel on both
    branches, poisoning each of the 22 fixture-supplied inputs in turn:

    - STABLE (``br > 0``): the sweep's result holds exactly.  ``wstar3``
      is a literal zero (kernels/ysu.cu:177), so the surface buoyancy
      flux reaches nothing but ``rhs[0]`` (:480), and ``hfx`` is the
      UNIQUE input whose corruption surfaces as ``dtheta`` and nothing
      else.  That is the shape the field report described.
    - UNSTABLE (``br <= 0``): NO input has that signature.  The buoyancy
      flux sets the convective velocity scale (:173), which sets the
      mixed-layer diffusivity for momentum and moisture as well as heat,
      so a non-finite ``hfx`` poisons the whole column and the refusal
      names ``du``, first in launcher order.

    The producer detail below names ``hfx`` either way, which is the
    half the reader actually needs; only the output label moves.  Both
    branches are pinned in tests/test_ysu.py.

    ``status`` keeps the native single-readback path; the forensic work
    runs only on the failing branch of either path.

        of ``thompson_init``'s two INDEPENDENT presence-gated fills ran
        (``module_mp_thompson.F:493`` for CCN, ``:531`` for IN).  A receipt
        of ``{"ccn": False, "in": False}`` is the normal, correct answer on
        an aerosol-bearing domain.

        WHAT IT DOES NOT MEAN, on a RESUME.  woof's restart order is
        prepare -> ``initialize_physics`` -> ``restore_restart``
        (``woof/runtime.py``'s docstring for the integration loop), so a
        resumed mp=28 domain is still all-zero aerosol when this runs and
        the receipt will say both fills happened -- and then
        ``restore_restart`` overwrites ``nwfa``/``nifa``/``nwfa2d`` with the
        checkpointed fields.  The resumed forecast therefore integrates the
        CHECKPOINTED aerosol, not the synthetic profile; the receipt is a

        The call cadence and the LSM contract are the MM5 layers': the

        and RIB) land in the same ``fields`` slots ``_run_sfclay`` fills,
        because that contract is a property of woof's surface seam rather
        than of a scheme.  What is MYJ's -- the viscous sublayer over
        water, the Zilitinkevich thermal roughness over land, the five-pass
        flux iteration and the AKHS/AKMS/THZ0/QZ0/UZ0/VZ0 set the MYJ PBL
        consumes -- lives in :mod:`woof.core.myjsfc` next to its source
        anchors.

        Bindings with their source of truth:

        * ``RIB`` is written to ``fields["br"]``.  That is WRF's own
          binding, not an analogy: the surface driver passes ``br`` as
          MYJSFC's ``RIB`` actual argument
          (module_surface_driver.F:2199,:2217), and ``_run_noah`` copies
          ``br`` into ``rib`` for Noah.
        * ``USTM``/``WSPD``/``CH`` are filled from the driver's own
          post-call block (:2226-2231): ``ustm = ust``, ``wspd =
          max(sqrt(u1^2+v1^2), 0.001)``, ``ch = chs``.
        * ``Z0BASE`` is the background roughness the Zilitinkevich fix
          reads (module_sf_myjsfc.F:733).  It is a static field seeded from
          the cold-start ZNT in :func:`initialize_physics`, never the
          working ZNT the sea branch overwrites every iteration.
        * ``PBLH`` is MYJSFC's own TKE scan (:263-277), not MIXLEN's
          (module_bl_myjpbl.F:834).  The two use different interfaces on
          purpose and WRF lets the surface layer's value stand until the
          PBL call replaces it.
        * ``ITIMESTEP`` is one-based, matching WRF's NTSD: the scheme's
          first-step branches seed USTAR, QSFC, THZ0 and QZ0.

        the partition functions, the prescribed-profile nonlocal
        transport, the TKE diagnostic chain -- lives in
        :mod:`woof.core.shinhong` next to its source anchors.

        Scheme-specific bindings, each with its source of truth:

        * ``psim``/``psih`` receive the FULL similarity denominators
          ``fm``/``fh`` exactly as YSU's seam does: the scheme
          reconstructs zol as ``br*fm^2/fh`` from them
          (module_bl_shinhong.F:751-780, transcribed at
          woof/verify/shinhong_ref.py:735-737), the same construction
          WRF's PBL driver feeds both YSU-family wrappers.
        * ``corf`` is ``state.f``, the per-column Coriolis parameter
          2*Omega*sin(lat) at mass points -- the SAME field the
          dycore's Coriolis+curvature kernel consumes
          (woof/core/dycore.py add_coriolis_curvature; filled by
          DomainState.set_map_coriolis, zeros on idealized runs).  The
          scheme reads it only through ``f = max(corf, eps1)``
          (module_bl_shinhong.F:2001, kernel :453), so the idealized
          zero lands on WRF's own eps1 floor.
        * ``tke`` is ``state.e_sgs``, the scheme's own published SGS
          TKE fed back as next step's ``tke_in`` -- and after the
          launch the validated ``out["tke"]`` is written back to
          ``state.e_sgs``, which is the field the D1 gray-zone
          instrument scores and the restart stream carries.
        * ``tke_diag=1`` always: the dispatch-row note documents why
          the WRF namelist knob is not imported (the chain is a
          passenger diagnostic; tendencies never read it).
        * ``dx``/``dy`` are the run's own spacings -- the whole point
          of the scheme is that the answer moves with sqrt(dx*dy), so
          each nest launches with its own pair.
        * No ``exch_m``: the WRF wrapper publishes a heat exchange
          coefficient only (EXCH_H); the driver's exch_m field keeps
          its allocated zeros rather than inheriting another scheme's.

           operator uses (launch_n2; authority ``brunt_vaisala_n2`` is
           the pinned discrete form).  SASE-M1 (S4-2): n2_eff =
           launch_moist_n2 beside it -- the DK82 saturated N^2_m where
           the registered binary switch fires, the dry bits verbatim
           elsewhere (authority ``moist_n2``); the step receives BOTH
           (``n2_moist=n2_eff`` for the three substitution points, dry
           ``n2`` for the w-sensor screen).  SASE-M1b (S4-3c): the
           same pair also drives the moist master-length limb inside
           the step's vertical channel (launch_sase_step passes
           ``n2_dry=n2`` down exactly when the seam is engaged) -- no
           additional driver field or call.  ``cfg.sase_moist_n2``
           (default True = the model as built) gates the seam: False
           passes ``n2_moist=None`` so the step uses the DRY field at
           all three substitution points and forms no M1b bound, while
           the moist field is still computed for the M2 vent's
           saturation veto (step 5) -- M1 off, M2 standing.
        3. The named surface source (:func:`sase_surface_e_source`)
           deposits ``dt*source`` into the lowest ``e_sgs`` level BEFORE
           the fused step, so this interval's dissipation/clip acts on
           it (the source is non-negative, so the E_MIN floor holds).
        4. ``launch_sase_step`` advances the work winds and
           ``state.e_sgs`` in place through the S3-6c SPLIT scheme
           (authority ``sase_split_step``): domain-level solve
           (plan-bound decision 1) on the uniform clamped strain with
           the representative spacing dz_rep = FP64 mean layer
           thickness (carry-forward 4); the explicit HORIZONTAL stress
           divergence plus the implicit backward-Euler K_v vertical
           channel (per-column FP64 Thomas) run on the per-column
           ``dz_col`` = the model's live layer thicknesses; delta =
           sqrt(dx*dy), the horizontal filter scale of the L1
           sensor/solve operators (they are horizontal-scale operators,
           spec 4.1); the S3-6f partition bounds run inside the step
           (bulk-Richardson z_i from the model's own u/v/theta columns
           -> Delta/z_i cap; N^2-screened w-based resolved-fraction
           bound riding the SAME n2 field passed for the stability
           length -- f_used = min(f_solved, f_cap, f_w), diagnostics
           in the retained ledger); under damp_opt == 3 the config's
           zdamp engages
           the S3-6e damping-layer production taper (weight law shared
           with the audited KDH damper); S3-6j: the live sfclay ``ust``
           field drives the IMPLICIT surface momentum stress inside
           the step's u/v Thomas solves (drag conductance
           u*^2/max(|V1|, SFC_WSPD_FLOOR) folded into the bottom
           diagonal -- the YSU linearization; authority module
           docstring, S3-6j section), closing the missing-friction
           hole where ust fed only the step-3 e source; S3-9c: the
           live sfclay ``wspd`` field (the gust-enhanced speed u*
           was computed against) rides beside ust, multiplying the
           conductance by the audited YSU gustiness factor
           (spd1/wspd)^2 (authority module docstring, S3-9c
           section) so gust-inflated u* is not applied at full
           strength against the resolved wind.  The returned
           ``kv`` and
           ``km_h`` fields (popped from the ledger) are the vertical
           and governed-horizontal diffusivities the scalar channel
           rides.
        5. A-grid rates (work - before)/dt; the split scalar channel
           for theta, qv, qc, qi -- IN THAT ORDER: horizontal K_h
           down-gradient mixing via launch_scalar_mix riding the split
           step's exported GOVERNED diffusivity field as K_h =
           km_h/Pr_t(f) (S3-6e: the identical K the momentum stress
           and e-transport used, at the post-surface-deposit e^n --
           flux-consistent by construction, superseding the Task-6
           pre-step-e kh_coef convention, which survives only as the
           CPU-shim seam fallback), then the implicit K_v/Pr_t(f)
           vertical solve of s* = s + dt*T_h on the step's own ``kv``
           field (the same K_v/Pr_t(f) the split step's buoyancy term
           used), rate = (s_new - s)/dt.  S3-11b: the theta and qv
           rows of that solve carry the SURFACE SCALAR-FLUX DEPOSIT
           (authority ``surface_scalar_flux_deposit``, registered
           SFC_SCALAR_FLUX = "explicit-deposit-v1") -- the live
           sfclay HFX/QFX applied to the lowest layer,
           theta*[0] += dt*HFX/(rho1*CP_AIR*thick_0) and
           qv*[0] += dt*QFX/(rho1*thick_0), fused into the bottom rhs
           BEFORE the sweep at the SAME fresh fluxes the step-3 e
           source consumes and the SAME rho1 (computed once,
           ``sase_surface_rho1``); qc/qi rows take no deposit and the
           seam is off only where the fluxes are zero (in-kernel
           guard, no config flag).  SASE-M2 (S4-5, spec C1-C3): the
           theta/qv/qc rows ALSO carry the CONDITIONAL VENTING
           deposit -- the diagnosed shallow mass-flux limb's
           face-registered profiles (authority ``plume_vent_flux``,
           launched here as ``launch_plume_vent_flux`` from the FROZEN
           pre-step state at the step's used f) deposited in flux form,
           phi*[k] += (Fs[k] - Fs[k+1])*dt/(rho1*thick_k), on the
           pre-solve state BEFORE the sweep, under the registered
           cap-family uniform rescale Fs = s*F (authority
           ``vent_deposit_rescale``, enforced at this seam and nowhere
           else).  F[0] = F[nz] = +0.0, so the scalar ledger extends
           with a ZERO net-column term and the surface flux stays owned
           by the S3-11a deposit above (double-counting ban).  Nothing
           enters ``sase_split_step`` and no Thomas row moves.  qi takes
           no vent deposit (authority scope).  Pr_t(f) is the S3-6g
           regime-blended Prandtl number (authority prandtl_blend)
           at the step's used f -- recomputed here from the retained
           ledger f, identical to the step's exported pr_t
           diagnostic.  Scope is plan-bound
           decision 2: moist scalars qv/qc/qi mix, number
           concentrations and qr do NOT (parity with YSU); the
           legacy CPU-shim fallback (no ``kv`` in the ledger) has no
           vertical solve and therefore no deposit row -- S4-5b Item 4c:
           it therefore does not DIAGNOSE the limb either (it used to
           launch the flux and cap-scale kernels and discard their
           output silently), and a RuntimeError after the scalar loop
           enforces that every diagnosed row was deposited.
        6. Dissipative heating: ``heat`` (m2 s-2 accumulated over dt,
           = the S3-6d EXACT analytic decay decrement
           e* - e*/(1 + b*dt)^2 minus clip_gain, plus the S3-6e smag
           bypass and taper redirect) deposits into internal
           energy through the theta tendency,
           dtheta += heat/(dt*cp*exner) -- the spec-4.2 "existing
           heating pathway" (same slot as h_diabatic-style theta
           rates).  S3-6f doc fix: since S3-6e ``heat`` is NOT
           pointwise sign-definite -- the smag bypass share P_h,heat
           inherits the horizontal pairing's local sign (backscatter
           cells), beside the rare source-driven floor cells -- exactly
           as the restated ledger defines it (authority module
           docstring); domain sums stayed positive in every suite
           fixture.
        7. couple_ysu_tendencies mass-couples/staggeres u, v, theta,
           qv, qc, qi exactly like YSU's rates; the w rate couples
           through :func:`couple_sase_w_tendency` and rides the pbl
           stack as the plain ``rw`` attribute (restart-REBUILT:
           replaced here every step before any read; never a serialized
           dataclass field, so the restart inventory is unchanged).

        STABILITY -- RESOLVED by S3-6b/6c (implicit vertical).  History
        (S3-6 review, kept for the record): the v0 SASE diffusion was
        fully explicit with the viscosity on the horizontal scale
        (nu ~ 0.3*delta*sqrt(e) at f = 0), so the vertical-diffusion
        number 2*nu*dt/dz1^2 was unbounded on coarse-Delta domains with
        thin lowest layers (d01: delta = 12 km, dz1 ~ 50 m, dt = 60 s
        -> O(10^2) once the surface source spins sqrt(e) up to ~1).
        The fix landed at the FORMULATION level exactly as required:
        the vertical channel now rides K_v = C_KV*l_v*sqrt(e) on the
        Blackadar length (S3-6h: further bounded in the RANS limb by
        the BL89 displacement lengths and the retained l_s; S3-6i:
        the RANS limb's coefficient decouples to the stable-limit
        C_KS where l_s binds, K_v -> C_KS*e/N -- the authority module
        docstring's S3-6h/S3-6i sections) and every vertical
        diffusion (momentum, e,
        scalars) advances backward-Euler through unconditionally stable
        M-matrix Thomas columns -- no vertical CFL bound exists; the
        explicit horizontal channel keeps its own 13x CFL margin at d01
        scale (authority test derivations).

        Registered approximations (controller ledger, 2026-07-20):
        (1) [RESOLVED by S3-6g] the fixed PR_T = 1/3 put the
        RANS-regime vertical scalar channel at K_v/PR_T ~ 3*kappa*u**z
        vs the observed ~1.2*kappa*u**z -- the smoke-c inversion-
        mixdown/wind-amplification root cause; the blended Pr_t(f)
        gives K_v/PR_RANS ~ 1.18*kappa*u**z at f = 0 (inside the
        observed band) while the LES limit keeps PR_LES.
        (2) The one-constant closure's equilibrium e ~ 1.05*u*^2 sits
        ~3-5x below the observed 3.3-5.5*u*^2 (sqrt(e) ~2x low),
        biasing l_s, horizontal K, buoyancy flux, and TKE products --
        still open; BLOCKS scientific claims about TKE magnitudes
        until revisited (validation-stage carry).

        Specified-boundary policy (registered adjudication, S3-6
        review): after the fused step, ``e_sgs`` is held at the E_MIN
        floor across the outer ``spec_bdy_width`` rows on all four
        lateral edges (the width covers the widest 4-cell test-filter
        halo, so the periodic-wrap contamination of the SASE horizontal
        operators never reaches the interior through e); the same width
        is excluded from the domain-level solve reductions
        (``exclude_boundary_width``); the coupled tendencies were
        already boundary-masked by the coupling helpers.

    """Return ``(initial GLW, provenance)`` or refuse to invent one.

    Downward longwave has exactly three exact origins, and this function
    is where a run is made to name which one it has.

    * ``"scheme"`` -- a longwave scheme is attached (``ra_lw_physics >
      0``), so the buffer allocated here is scratch: the scheme
      overwrites the whole field on its first radiation call, exactly as
      WRF's radiation driver zeroes ``GLW`` at the top of every call
      (``phys/module_radiation_driver.F:1722``) before its
      ``lwrad_select`` fills it.  The fill value is
      :data:`DECLARED_CONSTANT_GLW_WM2` because that is the value 1.8.7
      allocated, and a healthy run must stay byte-for-byte what it was.
    * ``"declared"`` -- the CALLER typed a value or handed a field.  An
      idealised column that wants a fixed longwave says so here; a route
      with a source GLW passes the source's array here.
    * ``"unused"`` -- nothing reads the buffer and nothing publishes it:
      no land-surface scheme to consume it, and radiation entirely off so
      no ``GLW`` row reaches wrfout.

    Anything else is a run that will CONSUME or PUBLISH a downward
    longwave that no scheme computed and no caller declared, and it is
    refused rather than filled.

    WHAT WRF v4.6.1 DOES with the same selectors, because the standing
    rule is to implement the defined behaviour rather than reproduce a
    bug, and here WRF is defined in both branches:

    * ``ra_lw_physics = 0`` with ``ra_sw_physics > 0``: FATAL.
      ``radiation_driver`` returns early only when BOTH are zero
      (``:1068``), so a shortwave-only run reaches ``lwrad_select``
      (``:1839``), which has no ``CASE (0)`` -- it falls to ``CASE
      DEFAULT`` (``:2245``) and calls ``wrf_error_fatal('The longwave
      option does not exist: lw_physics = 0')``.  The reciprocal
      pairing is fatal too: ``swrad_select``'s ``CASE (0)`` at ``:2827``
      calls ``wrf_error_fatal`` for every ``lw_physics`` except
      Held-Suarez (``:2831-2835``), so WRF permits a single stream only
      for that one idealised case.  woof refusing this pairing is
      WRF-CONFORMANT, not a divergence.
    * ``ra_lw_physics = 0`` with ``ra_sw_physics = 0``: the driver
      returns at ``:1068`` and ``GLW`` keeps its Registry-allocated
      0.0 W m-2, which every land-surface scheme then consumes as a real
      flux.  woof does NOT copy that: zero downward longwave is not a
      physical atmosphere, it is an absent one, and a column run under it
      cools without bound.  woof's divergence is to require the constant
      to be DECLARED -- documented here and named in the run receipt --
      instead of inheriting either WRF's 0.0 or 1.8.7's silent 300.0.

    Inputs accept scalars or arrays broadcastable to ``(ny,nx)``; soil
    inputs accept scalars, four-element profiles, or ``(4,ny,nx)`` arrays.
    ``landmask`` is WPS 1=land/0=water and is the authority for WRF XLAND
    (1=land/2=water).  Noah receives both masks and therefore skips water,
    while SFCLAY and YSU continue to compute their marine branches.  A
    :class:`woof.globe.core.landuse.LanduseInitialization` supplied through
    ``landuse`` takes precedence for the WRF cold-start mask/category,
    roughness, surface-optics, UST, PBLH, and MAVAIL fields.

    A radiation or cumulus callable is selected by its nonzero RunConfig
    scheme ID.  Legacy ``ra_physics=4`` resolves to RTE+RRTMGP and
    ``ra_physics=90`` to the analytic clear-sky adapter.  Split
    ``ra_lw_physics=0, ra_sw_physics=1`` resolves to Dudhia shortwave, and
    ``1, 1`` to WRF's classic RRTM longwave + Dudhia shortwave pair, which
    is a COMPOSITION of the two single-stream adapters rather than a
    coupled one (:class:`woof.core.rrtm_lw.RRTMDudhiaRadiation`).
    Production adapters require
    their UTC start time and mass-grid latitude/longitude here.
    ``cu_physics=1`` resolves to the
    Kain-Fritsch adapter (:class:`woof.core.kf.KainFritsch`).  A
    scheme callable receives keyword arguments ``atmosphere``, ``fields``,
    ``state``, and ``cfg`` and must return :class:`RadiationResult` or
    :class:`CumulusResult`, respectively.

    ``glw`` HAS NO DEFAULT -- see :func:`_resolve_initial_glw`, which is
    where the argument is turned into a value or the call is refused.
    With a longwave scheme attached the buffer is a transient: WRF
    ordering runs radiation before the surface layer and the LSM, and the
    first radiation call is due at ``itimestep = 1``, so the scheme's own
    flux is in the field before anything reads it.  With
    ``ra_lw_physics = 0`` it is NOT a transient -- Dudhia hands the field
    straight back and a fully radiation-free run has no adapter at all --
    so whatever is in the buffer IS the run's entire downward longwave,
    and this function will not pick that number on the caller's behalf.
    Pass ``glw=`` explicitly to declare a fixed sky (the historical
    idealised value is :data:`DECLARED_CONSTANT_GLW_WM2`) or to hand the
    call a source's own GLW field.  A real experiment that means it also
    declares it in the config, which is what
    :func:`woof.physics_compat.constant_longwave_refusal` and
    :func:`woof.physics_compat.radiation_off_land_surface_refusal` read
    at load -- two separate claims, two separate tokens.

    #     aerosol-bearing parent takes thompson_init's has_CCN branch
    #     (:516-522) exactly as WRF's would -- no refill, and no re-derived
    #     nwfa2d;
    #   * a RESUME: woof's order is prepare -> initialize_physics ->
    #     restore_restart, so the fill DOES run here on the all-zero cold
    #     state and restore_restart then overwrites it with the checkpointed
    #     aerosol.  The resumed run integrates the checkpoint, which is the
    #     property that matters; the receipt records what this call did, not
