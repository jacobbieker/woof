/* New Tiedtke cumulus (cu_physics = 16), one CUDA thread per mass column.
 *
 * Mirror authority: gpuwm.verify.ntiedtke_ref.np_ntiedtke_prep.
 * WRF v4.6.1 transcription anchors:
 *   phys/module_cu_ntiedtke.F
 *     391-455   cu_ntiedtke_pre_run: delt, slimsk, the interface-height
 *               accumulation, omega, and THE VERTICAL FLIP
 *   phys/physics_mmm/cu_ntiedtke.F90
 *     228-239   the scale-dependency factors scale_fac / scale_fac2
 *
 * STAGE: PREP ONLY.  cumastrn and everything under it is not here yet.  The
 * prep is graded first on purpose -- see the flip note below.
 *
 * ==========================================================================
 * THE VERTICAL IS INVERTED, and this is the only cumulus kernel where it is
 * ==========================================================================
 * WRF hands the driver a bottom-up column: k = kts is the surface.
 * cu_ntiedtke_pre_run reverses it, so cu_ntiedtke_run and everything below
 * it run TOP-DOWN -- k = 0 is the model top, k = nz-1 is the surface.  That
 * is the ECMWF convention that the whole Tiedtke line inherits.
 *
 * gf.cu and kf.cu are both bottom-up.  So this is the one structural
 * inversion in the port, and its failure mode is SILENT: an upside-down
 * column produces finite, plausible, entirely wrong numbers rather than a
 * crash or a NaN.  It is graded before any physics for exactly that reason
 * (tests/test_ntiedtke_prep_parity.py, max_ulp == 0 against
 * gpuwm/data/ntiedtke/oracle/nt-prep-levels.csv).
 *
 * ==========================================================================
 * FP CONTRACTION IS PINNED FROM THE FIRST LINE, NOT RETROFITTED
 * ==========================================================================
 * __fmaf_rn / __fmul_rn / __fadd_rn are NVIDIA-guaranteed never merged, so
 * pinning to them costs nothing.  ptxas otherwise contracts by local
 * register pressure, which means a RUNTIME BRANCH can leave two clones of
 * the same arithmetic rounding differently -- that has already failed a
 * bitwise gate once in this tree, and the fix was a branch-free shape.
 *
 * New Tiedtke is branchy by construction: ktype selects between three
 * closures INSIDE the column, and scale_fac applies on one arm while
 * scale_fac2 applies on another.  So every arithmetic expression in this
 * file is spelled in explicit rounded intrinsics from the outset, including
 * the ones that look too simple to matter.  `dot` is the live example: it is
 * a left-to-right chain of three multiplies over one add, and letting ptxas
 * fuse any pair of them moves bits.
 *
 * DIVISION: gfortran's `/` and CUDA's default -prec-div=true are both
 * correctly rounded, and __fdiv_rn is that operation named.  sqrtf likewise
 * (-prec-sqrt=true), which is why scale_fac2 = scale_fac**0.5 needs no
 * glibc mirror even though it is a real exponent -- gfortran folds the 0.5
 * case to sqrt and both sides are correctly rounded.
 *
 * LOGARITHM: scale_fac reads log(dxref/dx), and glibc's logf is NOT CUDA's.
 * gfk_log (glibc_flt32.cuh, transcribed from glibc 2.39
 * sysdeps/ieee754/flt-32/e_logf.c) is the reference's own function.  Checked
 * 2026-08-28: e_logf.c and e_logf_data.c are identical between glibc 2.35
 * and 2.39 apart from their copyright line, so the oracle built on this
 * box's 2.35 and this kernel's 2.39 transcription agree by construction.
 *
 * ==========================================================================
 * LAYOUT
 * ==========================================================================
 * Every column array is LEVEL-MAJOR, a[k * ncol + i], so the 32 threads of a
 * warp touch 32 consecutive floats at each level.  The per-thread local
 * frame is zero -- nothing here is a function-scope column array -- which
 * the compile-only probe confirms.  When cumastrn lands it brings 79 column
 * arrays that DO need somewhere to live, and that somewhere is a global
 * workspace in the kf.cu shape, not the stack: MEASURED on an RTX 5070
 * Ti (70 SMs x 1,536, sm_120), those 79 as function-scope locals compile to
 * a 15,496 B frame at nz = 49 and reserve 1,483.9 MiB, against 0 B and
 * 0.0 MiB in the workspace shape.
 */

/* ==========================================================================
 * THE LAUNCH-GEOMETRY DESCRIPTOR, CHECKED ON THE DEVICE
 * ==========================================================================
 * The workspace is per-block and lane-interleaved: element k of slot s for
 * lane t lives at block_base + (s*nz + k)*LANES + t.  A column's slots
 * therefore belong to one (block, lane) pair FOR THE WHOLE STAGE SEQUENCE.
 *
 * If one stage were launched on a different geometry -- a different
 * threads-per-block, a different grid, a different column ordering -- that
 * column would resume on a different lane and read ANOTHER COLUMN's state.
 * Nothing would crash.  Every number would stay finite.  It is the worst
 * failure mode in this port.
 *
 * It is also the one guarantee with no analogue in the Fortran, so no
 * comparison against the reference can catch it, and this project's culture
 * is kernel performance work: cutypen is at 91 registers and someone will
 * want to re-tile it for occupancy.
 *
 * So the geometry is not documentation.  Every kernel takes the descriptor
 * it was promised, REPORTS the geometry it actually observed, and refuses
 * to compute when the two disagree -- which turns a silent cross-column
 * read into a loud parity failure.  gpuwm/core/ntiedtke.py owns the one
 * descriptor and is the only thing that launches these; a stage cannot be
 * re-tiled alone without changing the descriptor every stage reads.

/* ==========================================================================

 * ==========================================================================
 * cu_ntiedtke.F90:3324-3357 (cuadjtqn kcall == 1) and :1330-1748 (cutypen).
 *
 * cutypen is THE TRIGGER.  It decides ktype, and ktype is what selects
 * which scale factor applies downstream -- :676 scale_fac for deep,
 * :716 scale_fac2 for shallow -- so this routine is where the property
 * this whole port was bought for is actually decided.
 *
 * It assigns ktype 0, 1 and 2 ONLY.  ktype 3 (mid-level) is assigned later
 * in cubasmcn, called from cuascn:1968, and is not this routine's business.
 *
 * ==========================================================================
 * WHY EVERY EXPRESSION HERE IS SPELLED IN ROUNDED INTRINSICS
 * ==========================================================================
 * This is the branchiest routine in the scheme: two full parcel ascents
 * (shallow, then deep over ~23 candidate departure levels), each with an
 * early exit, a cloud-base refinement with two arms, and a reset that
 * rewrites the output arrays.  ptxas contracts by LOCAL REGISTER PRESSURE,
 * so a runtime branch can leave two clones of the same arithmetic rounding
 * differently -- that has already failed a bitwise gate once in this tree
 * and the fix was a branch-free shape.
 *
 * The shallow and deep ascents are near-identical in shape and differ in
 * three places (entrainment, the plu clamp, the departure-level seed).
 * They are written as ONE helper taking a `deep` flag rather than two
 * clones, precisely so ptxas cannot contract the two copies differently:
 * one body, one rounding.
 *
 * SCRATCH: the 11 per-column working arrays live in caller-provided global
 * buffers, not on the stack.  At nz = 49 they would be 2,156 B of frame,
 * over the 1,024 B default stack, and every byte of frame costs 105 KiB of
 * VRAM.  In global scratch the frame stays 0 B.

 * Slice 4a: cubasmcn and cuentrn
 * ==========================================================================
 * cu_ntiedtke.F90:3457-3482 (cubasmcn) and :3516-3536 (cuentrn).
 *
 * cubasmcn assigns ktype = 3 (:3480) and is therefore where the mid-level
 * arm of the scheme begins.  cuascn calls it once per level, jk = klev-1..3.
 *
 * ==========================================================================
 * THIS KERNEL MUST NOT INITIALISE ITS OUTPUTS
 * ==========================================================================
 * All THIRTEEN of cubasmcn's outputs are written only inside its guard.  A
 * column that does not trigger keeps the CALLER's value in every one of
 * them -- ktype, kcbot, klab, ptu, pqu, plu, pmfu, pmfub, pmfus, pmfuq,
 * pmful, pdmfup and plrain.
 *
 * So the reflex of zeroing outputs at kernel entry, which almost every CUDA
 * kernel does, would diverge from WRF on every non-triggering column.  On
 * this fixture that is 48 of 108 columns for cubasmcn, and the failure would
 * be QUIET: the triggering columns would still match.  Nothing here writes a
 * slot outside the guard, and the parity test covers both sides of it.
 *
 * The same applies to cuentrn, whose entire body sits inside `if (ldwork)`.
 *
 * See gpuwm/data/ntiedtke/oracle/nt-aliasing-audit.txt and section 7 of
 * docs/ntiedtke/PORT-RECORD.md for the contract this is an instance of.

 * ==========================================================================
 * cumastrn:566-568 FLIPS ktype between cuascn and here -- deep becomes
 * shallow when the cloud is thinner than zdnoprc, and shallow becomes deep
 * when it is not.  Feeding this kernel cuascn's ktype runs the wrong arm.
 * That cost two rounds of debugging on the mirror; the caller must pass the
 * post-:568 value.
 *
 * ==========================================================================
 * WHAT IS UNDEFINED OUTSIDE THE DEEP BRANCH
 * ==========================================================================
 * zheat, zcape, zcape1, zcape2, ztauc, ztaubl and upbl are dimension(klon)
 * arrays in cumastrn assigned ONLY inside `if(ldcum .and. ktype==1)`.  For
 * any other column the reference leaves them at whatever they held -- the
 * pqsenh[0] class.  This kernel writes them only where the reference does,
 * so a non-deep column's slots keep the caller's values.  Do not initialise
 * them; that would diverge on 66 of 108 columns and grade green on the rest.
 *
 * ztau is a SCALAR in cumastrn, written :676 and read :684 inside one loop
 * iteration.  It never escapes, so one thread per column reproduces it.
 * (itopm2 is the scalar that LOOKS like it escapes and does not -- see
 * docs/ntiedtke/PORT-RECORD.md §9 before porting cuflxn.)

/* =====================================================================
 * Stage 7: cuascn -- the entraining/detraining updraft (:1755-2258)
 * =====================================================================

 * nt-cuascn-out-levels.csv and nt-cuascn-surface.csv at max_ulp == 0; the
 * NumPy mirror in gpuwm/verify/ntiedtke_ref.py is the same transcription
 * and the two are graded against the same oracle rows.
 *
 * NO WORKSPACE.  cuascn declares five klon x klev locals -- zlrain, zbuo,
 * kup, zodetr, pdmfen -- and the naive port gives each a (nz+2, ncol)
 * global array, which at nz = 62 on a 372x284 domain is 81 MiB of VRAM for
 * scratch.  None of it is needed:
 *
 *   zodetr  is never assigned anywhere in the routine.  Dead.
 *   pdmfen  is written at :2050 and never read.  A local, not a dummy, so
 *           nothing downstream can observe it.  Dead.
 *   zlrain  is read only at jk+1 and jk.
 *   zbuo    is read only at jk+1 and jk.
 *   kup     is read only at jk+1 and jk.
 *
 * The loop descends one level at a time, so the last three are strictly
 * one-level lookback and live in registers -- three floats instead of
 * three arrays.  That is the difference between 0 B of scratch and 81 MiB,
 * and it is why this kernel still measures 0 B frame.
 *
 * The seeding is the part to get right.  At the top of each iteration the
 * "cur" register must hold what section 2 and section 3 left at level jk:
 * zero, except kup at cloud base, which section 3 set to 0.5*wbase^2.  The
 * "prev" register enters the loop holding level klev under the same rule.
 * cubasmcn can zero zlrain at jk+1 mid-iteration (:3480), so it takes the
 * prev register by reference rather than reading the array.
 *
 * llo3 IS A TILE-WIDE FLAG, not a per-column one: :1994 sums klab over all
 * columns and :2009 latches it true for the rest of the run.  It is passed
 * in as a kernel argument for that reason, and NOT recomputed per lane.
 * test_ntiedtke_cuascn_parity.py::test_llo3_is_true_throughout is the gate
 * that makes passing 1 exact on this fixture; a tile that broke it would
 * need a block-wide OR reduction here, and the gate fails first.

 * ALL SIX LEVEL OUTPUTS ARE CLASS 2 -- ptd, pqd, pmfd, pmfds, pmfdq and

 * every level the routine does not reach keeps the caller's value.  THIS
 * KERNEL MUST NOT ZERO THEM.  Zeroing outputs at entry is the reflex in
 * almost every CUDA kernel ever written and it is wrong here on every level
 * but one.  The mirror learned that by being wrong on levels 1-4 of every
 * column; see docs/ntiedtke/PORT-RECORD.md section 14.
 *
 * pud and pvd are dummies the routine never mentions -- downdraft momentum
 * is cududvn's -- so they are not arguments at all.
 *
 * ztenwb/zqenwb are klon x klev locals, but each is written, adjusted and
 * read within ONE iteration, so they are registers.  0 B frame.
 *
 * The `is == 0 cycle` at :2448 is a horizontal reduction and it is INERT:
 * ztenwb/zqenwb/zph are set for every column before it, cuadjtqn is masked
 * by the same per-column llo2 the reduction sums, and everything after is
 * inside if(llo2).  So the per-column form below is exact, and unlike
 * cuascn's llo3 that was derived rather than assumed.

 * Thirty lines between cuascn and cudlfsn that nothing owned:
 *
 *   :566-568  THE KTYPE FLIP.  A deep column whose cloud is shallower than
 *             200 hPa becomes ktype 2; a shallow one that is deeper becomes
 *             ktype 1.  ktype selects scale_fac (deep) or scale_fac2
 *             (shallow) in the closure -- the entire reason for the port.
 *             This is the fifth failure's line: it sits between two stages
 *             that look adjacent, and feeding cuascn's ktype to the closure
 *             runs the wrong arm.  The closure kernel's header says it
 *             takes the CLOSURE-TIME ktype; THIS is what produces it.
 *   :580-588  the downdraft-array zeroing that four class-2 excuses in
 *             test_ntiedtke_aliasing_audit.py rest on.  Owning it clears
 *             those debts -- the excuses stop being conditional.
 *
 * ldcum is READ ONLY here.  ktype is flipped in place; ictop0 is set to
 * kctop for cumulus columns and left alone otherwise, which is the same
 * conditional-write discipline as everywhere else in this port.

 *              accumulator running DOWNWARD through the column.
 *   :863-880   entrainment-rate floors, and pdmfup recomputed from the

 *   :883-892   the downdraft-top humidity guard.
 *   :896-913   the near-cloud-top humidity guard, which can REDUCE plude.
 *
 * NOT THE MOMENTUM RESCALE.  That is :996-1016, off a different zmfs
 * computed against a different limit -- and the two share the local name.
 * This port attributed one range's job to the other once already.
 *
 * pmfude_rate arrives from CUFLXN's exit, not cuascn's: the 6.5 updraft

 * column reaches 0.5076 of it -- so this constant is graded only in the
 * sense that its guard is evaluated.  Named in

 * raincv/pratec.  Phase 1's end condition names that file, so the port
 * could not have reached it however many kernels were graded.
 *
 * TWO VERTICAL CONVENTIONS IN ONE STATEMENT, and this is the only kernel
 * in the port where that is true.  exner/qv/qc/qi/t/u/v are the driver's
 * untouched WRF-order inputs, k = 1 the SURFACE, and they are the

 * carry cu_ntiedtke_run's answer in SCHEME order, k = 1 the model TOP.
 * The routine pairs them by flipping and so does this: zz = klev + 1 - jk.
 *
 * ASSIGNED, NOT ACCUMULATED, and unconditionally -- unlike cudtdqn and the
 * KE dissipation there is no `if` in the loop and no add.  Every level of

 * not inferred from the intent.
 *
 * NO PHYSICAL CONSTANTS.  Every other stage takes the six-member family
 * through nt_init; this one takes none, because the routine uses none.
 * Passing them anyway would make the signature lie about the dependency.
 *
 * THE ASSOCIATION IS STRUCTURAL: (tf - t)/exner*rdelt is subtract,
