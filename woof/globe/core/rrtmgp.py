# Radiation-facing effective radii are contracted in MICRONS across every

    THE BREAKAGE THIS CLOSES, measured on a real forecast.  A 6 h GFS run
    on the shipped ``p3-mp50-...`` suite died at its FIRST radiation call
    (12 steps in, radt = 12 min) with "effi is outside the
    physical-plausibility band [1.0, 600.0] microns; the state contract is
    microns -- a radii writer probably emitted another unit".  The writer
    had emitted microns and the values were physical: over 5.59 M cells the
    field ran ``min 1.3832, max 21495`` microns, and those two numbers are
    EXACTLY the minimum and maximum of the shipped table's own column 6.
    P3 is a lookup-table scheme; ``diag_effi`` is that column and nothing
    else, so the attainable set is the column's range.

    Why P3 needs its own band while nothing else does: every other shipped
    scheme clamps its ice radius inside its own microphysics (Thompson's
    ``MIN(re, 125.E-6)``, WSM6's equivalent), so a value outside a generic
    band really is a unit mistake there.  WRF applies NO clamp to P3 --
    ``module_microphysics_driver.F:1597-1598`` passes ``re_ice`` straight
    out of the scheme -- and caps it in RADIATION instead, at
    ``resnow1d = 130`` with the mass discount ``MIN(0.99, (130/res)^2)``
    (module_ra_rrtmg_lw.F:12515-12532, _sw.F:11055-11067), which
    :func:`hydrometeor_paths`' p3 branch already transcribes.  A generic
    600 um band therefore refused the scheme for being itself, three cells
    in a thousand, and named a unit error that had not happened -- a
    refusal that misnames its breakage.

    NOT A WIDENED TOLERANCE.  The band is DERIVED from the table this
    install ships (sha256-pinned by
    :data:`woof.core.p3_tables.TABLE_1_2MOM_ASSET`), so it cannot drift
    from the scheme, and it keeps the whole point of the check: P3 returns
    metres and woof converts to microns, so an unconverted metres emission
    reads about 1.4e-6 and is still refused by the lower bound.

# Which cloud-optics coupling each microphysics selector gets.
#
# This table decides THREE things at once inside
# :meth:`RRTMGPRadiation.__call__`, which is why it is stated here as data
# with its WRF citations rather than inlined as a ``.get(mp, "kessler")``
# default: the branch :func:`hydrometeor_paths` takes (scheme-native radii
# vs. Kessler's constant 10 um / 50 um pair), whether the scheme's
# effc/effi/effs columns are read out of state at all, and -- through
# :data:`_ICE_ACTIVE_SCHEMES` -- the ``f_qi``/``f_qs`` flags
# :func:`cal_cldfra1` is called with.  A scheme that falls through to
# "kessler" therefore does not merely lose its radii: its ice and snow stop
# producing cloud fraction, and an overcast ice cloud radiates as clear sky.
#
# THE ENTRY THAT WAS MISSING.  ``28`` (THOMPSONAERO) is the aerosol-aware
# Thompson package and takes the SAME radiative coupling as classic
# Thompson.  WRF's authority for that, all in the stock v4.6.1 tree:
#
#   * ``Registry/Registry.EM_COMMON:3036`` declares
#     ``package thompsonaero mp_physics==28 - moist:qv,qc,qr,qi,qs,qg;
#     scalar:...;state:re_cloud,re_ice,re_snow`` -- character for character
#     the same ``moist:`` inventory and the same three ``re_*`` state
#     fields as line 3024's ``thompson`` (mp==8).  ``F_QI``/``F_QS`` are
#     therefore both true for mp=28, which is exactly what
#     ``cal_cldfra1`` keys on.
#   * ``phys/module_physics_init.F:1005-1006`` lists ``THOMPSON`` and
#     ``THOMPSONAERO`` as two members of ONE disjunction that sets
#     ``has_reqc = has_reqi = has_reqs = 1`` (:1021-1023); the P3 /
#     Jensen-Ishmael ``has_reqs = 0`` override at :1027-1033 does not
#     name THOMPSONAERO.  So mp=28 hands radiation all three radii.
#     Those same three flags are the ONLY gate on the block that computes
#     them -- ``module_mp_thompson.F:1466`` opens
#     ``IF (has_reqc.ne.0 .and. has_reqi.ne.0 .and. has_reqs.ne.0)`` around
#     calc_effectRad and the :1475-1477 clamps -- so in WRF a scheme
#     computes re_cloud/re_ice/re_snow if and only if radiation consumes
#     them.  Computing them for mp=28 and then discarding them at the
#     radiation boundary is not a WRF configuration at all.
#   * Neither RRTMG wrapper branches on the selector for any of this:
#     ``phys/module_ra_rrtmg_lw.F`` tests ``mp_physics`` only at
#     :12131-12136 and ``_sw.F`` only at :10732-10737, both for
#     FER_MP_HIRES / FER_MP_HIRES_ADVECT / ETAMP_HWRF.  ``cal_cldfra1``'s
#     only ``mp_physics`` branch is the same Ferrier one
#     (``phys/module_radiation_driver.F:3926-3937``); mp=8 and mp=28 both
#     take the ``F_QI .and. F_QC .and. F_QS`` arm at :3870-3877.
#
# woof's own side of the contract is already in place: ``mp_physics == 28``
# allocates effc/effi/effs and background-fills them with the same
# RE_QC_BG/RE_QI_BG/RE_QS_BG values mp=8 uses
# (``woof/core/state.py``), and the mp=28 adapter writes them every step
# through ``launch_aerosol_effective_radius``
# (``woof/core/microphysics_aerosol.py``) under mp_gt_driver's OWN clamps
# (module_mp_thompson.F:1466-1479), which is the identical clamp pair mp=8
# takes because mp_gt_driver is one driver serving both packages.
# ``woof/core/rrtmg_legacy.py`` already carried this same judgement
# (``_MP_DECLARES_RADII[28] = True``, ``_LEGACY_ICE_ACTIVE_MICROPHYSICS``);
# this table is the RTE+RRTMGP half of it, and the two are pinned equal by

    Upstream RTE+RRTMGP refuses a size outside its table
    (``mo_cloud_optics_rrtmgp.F90``: "liquid effective radius is out of
    bounds") and leaves the host model to keep them inside; the shipped
    v1.9 domain is 2.5-21.5 um for the liquid radius and 10-180 um for
    the ice diameter, and a two-moment scheme's snow (radius 15-3000 um
    in Morrison) and freshly nucleated ice leave it routinely.  Above
    the upper bound the layer is carried geometrically: extinction of a
    particle much larger than the wavelength is its cross-section, so
    per unit mass it goes as 1/size, and scaling the in-cloud path by
    bound/size at the bound's single-scattering albedo and asymmetry
    reproduces that limit instead of radiating 500 um snow as 180 um ice
    (2.8x the extinction).  Below the lower bound the size is clipped
    (the small-particle limit is not a scaling of the table's end and
    the mass there is small); both are counted so the treatment is never
    silent.  Cells whose path is zero get the clip only (the kernel does
    not read their size) and are not counted.

    ``treatment="clip"`` clips above the upper bound as well, at the full
    path: the WRF-transcribed explicit-radius and P3 couplings use it
    because their arithmetic is fixture-pinned to module_ra_rrtmg's own
    size cap and snow discount, which already bound the oversize their
    way; the carry on top would discount twice.  The count record is the
    same under both.

    ``cldfra`` (the layer cloud fraction the paths were divided by, or
    None for an overcast coupling) weights the ``*_radiative_fraction``
    fields of the record (see :class:`SizeBounding`); ``sentinel_masks``
    is the optional ``(liquid, ice)`` pair of boolean cell masks the
    Morrison coupling reports its no-mass-radius cells through.

    ``path_sums=False`` is the chunked coupling's form: the counts are
    formed for these columns and the fraction fields are left None, and
    the result carries the :class:`SizeBoundingTerms` the caller
    assembles over the whole grid for :func:`finish_size_bounding`.  The

    """Convert hydrometeor mixing ratios to cloud-optics inputs on device.

    Mixing ratios and Morrison number concentrations are per kg dry air.
    Per WRF the radiation liquid path is cloud water only and the ice path
    is cloud ice plus snow; rain never feeds the paths
    (module_ra_rrtmg_sw.F:11029-11034, module_ra_rrtmg_lw.F:12488-12493:
    ``gliqwp = qc1d(k) * pdel*100/gravmks*1000``).  When ``cldfra`` is
    given the grid-box paths become in-cloud paths through WRF's
    ``max(0.01, cldfrac)`` division (same lines).
    Kessler uses a 10 micron liquid radius and 50 micron ice diameter.
    WSM6, Thompson, and NSSL consume their scheme-native cloud/ice/snow
    effective radii (MICRONS, the state contract) and merge ice plus snow
    into the single RRTMGP ice species.  ``"thompson"`` serves BOTH Thompson
    packages: mp_physics=8 (Registry.EM_COMMON:3024) and the aerosol-aware
    mp_physics=28 (:3036) declare the same ``moist`` inventory and the same
    ``re_cloud/re_ice/re_snow`` state, and module_physics_init.F:1005-1006
    lists them together in one ``has_req*`` disjunction, so their radiative
    coupling is identical -- see :data:`_MP_CLOUD_OPTICS_SCHEME`.
    ``snow_treatment`` selects how snow joins that path:
    ``full-snow-mass-into-ice`` keeps the adapter's original
    full-mass merge; ``wrf-rrtmg-130um-snow-discount`` reproduces WRF
    v4.6.1's option-4 explicit-radius coupling -- ice path from cloud ice
    only (module_ra_rrtmg_lw.F:12500-12505, _sw.F:11040-11045), snow mass
    multiplied by ``MIN(0.99, (130/re_s)^2)`` with ``re_s`` floored at 10
    and capped at 130 microns (_lw.F:12242,12515-12532, _sw.F:10824,
    11055-11067; the FP32 discount expression is bitwise-pinned by
    tests/data/wrf_rrtmg_snow_discount_fixture.csv).  WRF's dead
    ``gicewp`` accumulation of the 1% remainder (_lw.F:12518, _sw.F:11058
    -- computed but never stored to ``cicewp``) is intentionally not
    reproduced.  The mass-weighted single-species diameter remains a
    documented adapter divergence from WRF's separate Fu snow species.
    ``snow_treatment`` is validated for every scheme but only alters the
    explicit-snow-radius (WSM6/Thompson/NSSL) coupling: WRF discounts snow
    only when the scheme supplies re_snow (iceflg=5); Morrison and Kessler
    keep WRF's merged path (_lw.F:12488-12493).
    ``"p3"`` is mp_physics=50 and takes neither of those: WRF remaps P3's
    single ice category ONTO the snow species and empties the ice path
    (_lw.F:12250-12261, _sw.F:10851-10863), so the branch consumes effc and
    effi, refuses an effs, and applies WRF's iceflg=5 discount at P3's own
    ice radius unconditionally -- see the branch for why the compatibility
    token does not gate it.
    Morrison liquid size is the cloud-droplet gamma radius alone -- rain
    carries no radiative mass, so it contributes no radius either
    (``effr`` is accepted for interface parity with Morrison's
    diagnostics and ignored); ice and snow combine into the one RRTMGP
    ice species at the area-conserving size: each species first at the
    solid-ice effective diameter that carries its area per unit mass,
    ``2 re_x rho_x / rho_ice`` (Morrison's cloud ice at 500 and snow at
    100 kg/m3 against the table's 917; MORRISON_*_DENSITY_KG_M3), then the
    mass-weighted harmonic mean ``(qi + qs) / (qi / d_i + qs / d_s)``:
    extinction of the two populations is their summed cross-section, and
    that is the single size whose extinction at the summed mass equals
    it.  (Until 2026-09-04 the two combined by NUMBER at their
    sphere-equivalent sizes, which put the merged size at the cloud-ice
    radius wherever ice crystals outnumber snow, i.e. nearly everywhere,
    and read the table as if a 100 kg/m3 snowflake were solid ice of the
    same diameter; on the T255 control the snow is four fifths of the
    frozen condensate.)
    Every branch ends in :func:`bound_cloud_sizes`: the sizes are brought
    inside ``size_bounds`` (default: the domain of the shipped tables,
    :func:`shipped_cloud_size_bounds`; a driver passes the bounds of the
    tables it loaded) and the record of what that touched rides on the
    result as ``size_bounding``.  The Morrison branch carries the oversize
    geometrically; the WRF-transcribed explicit-radius and P3 branches
    clip, as module_ra_rrtmg does past its own cap (their fixture-pinned
    arithmetic already discounts the snow WRF's way).
