"""Per-operator total-energy ledger: an instrument, never a source.

Around every operator of ``MoistHybridModel.step`` the observer marks the
atmosphere and the ledger books the PER-LEVEL NET CHANGE of the column
energy that operator made.  Per level ``k`` (area-weighted global means,
``grid.global_mean`` quadrature, column integrals ``f dp_k / g``):

* ``kinetic``   = 0.5 (u^2 + v^2) dp_k / g
* ``internal``  = cv T dp_k / g
* ``potential`` = R T dp_k / g, the level's share of the gravitational
  potential energy: ``int Phi dp / g = Phi_s ps / g + int R T dp / g`` by
  parts (budgets.py), so the level potential is booked as ``R T dp / g``
  and the surface term ``Phi_s ps / g`` as its own row (index ``nlev``);
* ``total``     = kinetic + internal + potential = (cp T + K) dp_k / g on
  a level and ``Phi_s ps / g`` on the surface row.

Summed over the rows, ``total`` is the hydrostatic primitive-equation
invariant ``int (cp T + K) dp / g + Phi_s ps / g`` (Kasahara 1974), the
same quantity budgets.py reports as ``total_dry_energy_j_m2``.

What the instrument is for, and what it must not do.  The Level 7 review
(2026-09-01) measured what a ledger of the POINTWISE-RECTIFIED column
kinetic-energy difference does: it admits ``max(delta, 0)`` per column,
so a reversible exchange (the semi-implicit map converting kinetic energy
to enthalpy in half the columns and back in the other half) is booked as
loss in every column where it went one way, and on the shipped smoke the
"numerical loss" over-credited the dycore's actual removal about seven
times (165x for the semi-implicit operator, 6.7x for diffusion).  This
ledger books the signed, per-level, area-integrated NET of total energy,
so a reversible operator nets ~0 over a period and a dissipative one
nets its analytic decay (tests/test_arwen_global_insitu_energy.py holds
both), and nothing here feeds a tendency: the marks are read-only and a
run with the ledger on is bit-identical to a run with it off.

Cost.  One mark synthesizes theta, vorticity, divergence and ln ps (four
spectral syntheses, no water species: the surface potential needs ps
only and the dry column energy needs T, not Tv) and reduces on the
device; the vector crosses to the host with the batched flush.  Measured
on the T255 40-level native suite (dt = 100 s, 60 steps, RTX 5070 Ti,
2026-09-02, two repeats each): marks at every step cost 0.093 s of a
1.795 s IMEX step (1.7935 / 1.7952 s against 1.7019 / 1.7013 s without
them, 5.4%) and 0.097 s of a 1.739 s split step (eleven marks:
1.7424 / 1.7346 s against 1.6288 / 1.6549 s, 5.9%), so the ledger samples
every ``energy_every`` steps (InsituOptions, default 50: 0.11% of the
run's steps).  The T533 per-step cost is not measured on a card: the
T533 leg allocated 28.7 GiB beside two other jobs on the 32 GiB card and
died in its first sampled step, and the 16 GiB card holds no T533 run
(its T255 native run alone holds 11.2 GiB through the steps, 12.6 GiB at
the close).

Spectral bands and hemispheres (2026-09-02).  Beside the per-level rows
every mark books the column kinetic energy of the wind BAND-FILTERED in
total spherical-harmonic degree (``BAND_EDGES``: n 1-20, 21-60, 61-120,
121-200, 201-truncation; ``spectral_bands`` clips the edges to the
truncation and drops the bands it does not reach) and split by
hemisphere, so an operator's kinetic-energy traffic is read per band and
per hemisphere, not only per level.  Definitions:

* ``column_kinetic_j_m2[band][hemisphere]`` = the hemisphere's share of
  the sphere-mean ``int 0.5 |v_b|^2 dp / g``, where ``v_b`` is the wind
  synthesised from the vorticity and divergence coefficients of the
  band's degrees alone (``VorticityDivergenceOperator.wind_from_vordiv``
  on the masked coefficients; every other degree is zero).  The
  hemisphere share is the same Gaussian quadrature as the global mean
  with the other hemisphere's rows weighted zero, so northern + southern
  is the sphere mean.
* ``level_kinetic_m2_s2[band][hemisphere]`` = the same for
  ``0.5 |v_b|^2`` on the model level whose full pressure on the
  reference column (``ps = LEVEL_BAND_REFERENCE_PS_PA``) lies nearest
  ``LEVEL_BAND_TARGET_PA`` (250 hPa, the level the spectrum instrument
  reads), without mass weighting.
* the ``total`` entry of each is the unfiltered wind's value, so
  ``total - sum(bands)`` is the cross-band term (zero over the sphere
  for a uniform ``dp`` by orthogonality; not zero over one hemisphere or
  under a varying ``dp``) and the reader can show the closure.
* ``level_spectral_m2_s2[band]`` = ``[rotational, divergent]`` sphere-mean
  kinetic energy per unit mass on the same reference level, read from the
  coefficients alone by Parseval (``insitu.spectra``: ``a^2 / (2 n (n+1))
  sum_m w_m |c_nm|^2 / (4 pi)`` per degree, summed over the band's
  degrees), no synthesis; on the dealiased grid ``rotational + divergent``
  of a band equals the band's ``level_kinetic_m2_s2`` northern + southern
  to roundoff (the cross term integrates to zero over the sphere), which
  the calibration holds as the cross-check of the two code paths.  This
  is the entry that says WHICH part of a band an operator moves: the
  balanced (rotational) cascade or the gravity-wave (divergent) part.
* ``level_spectral_by_degree_m2_s2`` = the same Parseval reading on the
  reference level at EVERY total degree 0..truncation, ``rotational`` and
  ``divergent`` vectors (2026-09-04): the band partition says which band
  an operator moves, this says which DEGREE inside it, so a shelf that
  sits on the last fifteen degrees of the truncation band is attributed
  to the operator that builds it and not to the band's mean.  Same
  arithmetic as the band entry (the band entry is this vector summed
  over the band's degrees; the calibration holds the two equal), no
  synthesis, 2 (truncation + 1) more floats per mark.

An operator that injects a known kinetic energy at one degree is read in
that degree's band and in no other, over the sphere to 1e-9 relative and
exactly zero elsewhere (the other bands' filtered winds are identically
zero); a pure rotation of the state about the polar axis and its mirror
in the equator read zero in every band (tests/test_arwen_global_insitu_
energy_bands.py holds both families in both directions).  Cost: one
band-filtered wind synthesis per band per mark, paid only on sampled
steps; unsampled steps pay nothing (the marks are the no-op they were).
