#: A kind is a CLAIM, so it is only made where it can be MEASURED, and

#:
#: :data:`SHARED_SCOPE` claims the SELECTED SCOPE is what refuses, so it
#: is measured by asking the per-domain application -- the door a save
#: passes through -- to set exactly the run-wide values the option needs
#: on the selected domain.  Measuring it instead by whether All domains
#: is admitted classified three land-surface schemes, whose own sentence
#: reads "These settings apply to all domains ... Select All domains to
#: change them", as ordinary combination refusals, left them selectable,
#: and let a save fail on them.
#:
#: :data:`NOT_IMPLEMENTED` and :data:`SOURCE_ROUTE` claim the refusal
#: belongs to the OPTION rather than to the combination it was asked
#: about, so they are kept only where no installed choice for another
#: component admits the option on this setup at all.  A refusal one such
#: choice clears is :data:`COMBINATION`: the option is reachable, and
#: greying it walls off the repair search that exists to reach it.
#:
#: :data:`PRECONDITION` claims something about the MACHINE rather than
#: about the draft: a dataset or table set this install does not have.
#: It is measured by the same inventory the run door raises from
#: (``woof.config.run_preparation_preconditions``), so a greyed cell and
#: the refusal a run meets cannot say different things, and it fires at
#: :data:`AT_RUN_PREPARATION` because the configuration parser -- the

#: review, because a refusal that arrives after the plan was accepted is

def availability(request):
    """Why each installed physics option is closed to this draft, or open.

    THE FAILURE THIS CLOSES.  The companion greyed shared-scheme options
    with one general note beneath the whole panel, so an operator who
    reached for land surface, soil layers or a radiation variant while a
    single domain was selected read a sentence that did not name their
    option, and an option the parser would refuse at save looked
    selectable until they saved it.

    Nothing here decides anything.  Every option is APPLIED to the saved
    configuration on top of the current draft and handed to the ordinary
    parser, exactly as saving would; the emission route's own gate is
    then asked about the resolved domains.  Every sentence a caller shows
    is the refusing door's own, so a closed option and the refusal it
    will meet cannot say different things.

    AN OPTION CARRIES A SET OF REASONS, NOT ONE.  A single verdict has to
    choose which door to report, and choosing hid the half that mattered:
    a land-surface scheme one domain cannot set AND that every domain is
    refused reported only the second, so the panel offered the cell and
    the save failed on it.  Both are reported now, scope first, in the
    order a reader meets them.

    WHAT A REASON TAKES AWAY IS MEASURED, NOT READ OFF ITS KIND.  Every
    reason says whether it ``closes`` the option, and a caller greys a
    cell if and only if one of them does.  Two things close one: a
    selected scope that cannot apply these values at all, and a door that
    refuses this option under every installed choice for another
    component.  Everything else is a refusal of the option TOGETHER with
    the rest of the draft; the repair search exists to trade one for the
    other and is only reachable from a draft the reader was allowed to
    build, so those cells stay live and say what will happen instead.

    One option's surprise is not the panel's.  An unexpected exception
    from a single option is caught, reported as :data:`CHECK_FAILED` for
    that option alone, and never allowed to take down the answer for the
    other forty.

    Read-only: no candidate configuration is written and no forecast is
