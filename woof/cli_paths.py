"""A path the reader typed that is not there, said as a sentence.

Every door takes files and folders on its command line, and most of
them open the path where the work needs it rather than checking it at
the parser.  A missing or mistyped path then left as a
FileNotFoundError traceback from deep inside the handler: `woof
spectral cross-box` on a receipt that was not there, `woof domain
--forcing` on a file that had not been downloaded yet, and the same on
most of the three hundred path options the CLI carries.

The refusal boundary asks :func:`supplied_path_refusal` about every
FileNotFoundError, NotADirectoryError, IsADirectoryError and
PermissionError that reaches it.  When the path the error names is one
the reader supplied, the answer is one sentence naming the option and
the path, exit 2.  When it is a path the program chose for itself, the
answer is ``None`` and the traceback stands: a file this program expected
to have written and did not is a defect, and dressing it as a usage
error would hide it.
