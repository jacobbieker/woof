"""The as-posted fetch: every source's window, lead by lead as it posts.

``woof fetch --as-posted`` (the default; ``--whole-cycle`` is the old
rule) is one loop for every source (DESIGN A136 2.3).  It writes the
posting schedule first, waits for the window's start needs, then moves
each lead the moment one host holds all of it, verifies it, and
publishes a per-lead marker, in lead order, while the window's manifest
grows.  The bytes move through the transfer code that exists today --
the route engine (:func:`woof.fetch_routes.run_plan`, gated per lead)
or a legacy transport called for the verified prefix -- so no source
gets a path of its own.

Files, all under ``<out>/posting/`` (the names :mod:`woof.source_posting`
declares and :mod:`woof.chain_events` relays):

``schedule.json``  ``gpuwm.posting-schedule.v1``: every lead's
                   ``valid_time``, ``expected_at``, ``late_at``,
                   ``first_seen_at`` (with ``posted_when_first_asked``
                   once posted: true when the lead was already up at its
                   first ask, so the time only bounds its posting),
                   ``fetched_at``, ``endpoint`` and
                   ``state`` (``scheduled``, ``waiting``, ``posted``,
                   ``ready``, ``late``), once asked its ``last_answer``
                   (``posted``, ``not_posted``, ``not_heard``,
                   ``failed_verification``), the start needs and
                   ``expected_ready_at``.
``fNNN.json``      ``gpuwm.posted-lead.v1``, one per verified lead: its
                   fetched ``objects`` and, for a route that composes a
                   lead's parts into one file, those files under
                   ``composed``.
``failed.json``    ``code: source_behind`` when a lead passed its late
                   time (or the window its ``--wait-timeout-minutes``);
                   the fetch then exits 75 and a rerun resumes from the
                   verified prefix.
