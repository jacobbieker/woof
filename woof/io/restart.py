"""wrfrst-style full-state restart files with a bit-identical contract.

``write_restart`` serializes every cross-step model field, prognostics,
physics/soil/snow surface state, accumulators, held slow tendencies, the
KF driver persistence, and the model clock, so that ``restore_restart``
into a freshly prepared process continues the trajectory FP32-bit-exactly
(Phase 4 Task 8 gate: 6 h + restart + 6 h == uninterrupted 12 h on every
state field and accumulator).

Format: NumPy NPZ (an uncompressed zip of raw little-endian ``.npy``
members).  Chosen over NetCDF for exactness and auditability: the ``.npy``
payload is the array's memory bytes, so FP32 values (including negative
zeros, denormals, and NaN payloads) round-trip bit-exactly with no
writer-side dimension/type mapping in between, and any zip tool can audit
the members.  The wrfout NetCDF writer keeps its WRF-tooling role; restart
files are a model-internal exchange, not a product.

Completeness is ENFORCED, not hoped for: ``write_restart`` walks every
``DomainState`` attribute, every ``DomainState._scratch`` slot, and every
``PhysicsDriver`` attribute and raises :class:`RestartManifestError` for
anything not explicitly classified below as serialized, rebuilt, setup, or
infrastructure.  Adding model state without updating this manifest fails
the next restart write (and the CPU manifest tests) loudly.

Classification argument (audit2 restart findings, adjudicated here):

* SERIALIZED, read across step boundaries and not reconstructable:
  prognostics (+ Morrison moments and effective radii, which feed the NEXT
  radiation call), ``h_diabatic`` (WRF ``rdu``, Registry.EM_COMMON:1389,
  re-zeroing drops one step of retained heating), the dycore's exported
  advective forcing pair ``rthften``/``rqvften`` (WRF RTHFTEN/RQVFTEN, on
  the schemes that read them, same lifecycle as ``h_diabatic``: the
  producer is an RK stage that has not run yet when a resume reaches its
  first cumulus call), the km_opt=2 prognostic
  SGS TKE carrier ``tke`` (WRF ``r``, Registry.EM_COMMON:312, a developed
  turbulence field with no reconstruction route), the live microphysics
  accumulators in scratch (``mp_*``; the driver's diagnostic dataclass aliases
  this canonical set), the KF driver persistence (``cu_*`` scratch,
  W0AVG), the held coupled tendencies (mu-coupled at their historical due
  step: recoupling at restore is NOT bit-identical), the surface/Noah
  ``fields`` dict (UST/MOL/ZNT/QSFC/HFX/QFX/PBLH/SH2O/SNOTIME/ALBEDO/EMISS
  and the rest of WRF's r-flagged surface block), ``_pending_rainbl``,
  ``microphysics_updates`` (behavior-gating counter), and the clock.
* REBUILT, overwritten before every read: the RK time-t copies (written
  from prognostics at each ``dycore.step`` entry), the slow-tendency slots
  (zeroed each RK stage), the acoustic perturbations (reseeded by
  ``_init_small_steps`` each stage; ``ww_pp`` is checkpoint-only instead),
  and the per-call scratch work buffers (Morrison/Kessler prep, refl,
  advection, diffusion, LBC helpers).  The driver's one-frame
  ``refl_10cm`` handoff is also rebuilt: normal output consumes it before
  any same-step restart write, and a resume never rewrites the boundary
  frame.  The bit-identity gate is the proof of this list: a missed
  cross-step dependence diverges the trajectory.
  The driver ``microphysics`` dataclass is rebuilt as aliases of the
  serialized ``scratch/mp_*`` arrays; v2 files carrying both historical
  copies are accepted only when those copies compare byte-for-byte equal.
* SETUP, deterministic from config + ingest (base state, coordinates,
  map factors, LBC tables) or resolved while physics is initialized
  (radiation calendar/grid/gases/ozone, Noah parameters, scheme policies,
  and coefficient assets): rebuilt by the normal preparation path and
  VALIDATED against SHA-256 fingerprints stored in the header, so a restart
  into a different setup fails loudly instead of drifting.  The dynamics
  fingerprint covers the attached lateral-boundary FORCING tables (every
  interval's side values and tendencies, byte-level).  The physics identity
  separately carries explicit versioned algorithm/policy names plus actual
  active-asset byte digests; config IDs alone are not treated as proof of
  identical physics.  The resident LBC device tables are re-uploaded by
  ``attach_lateral_boundaries`` during preparation; ``restore_restart``
  requires that attachment to exist and restores the clock LAST, after
  attach reset it to zero (audit: attach rewinds every physics calendar).
* McICA carries no RNG state: the subcolumn generator's seeds are pure
  functions of the column pressures and the fixed permuteseed
  (kernels/rrtmgp_mcica.cu:35-47, mirrored by
  ``npref.np_mcica_maxran_masks``, proven there against WRF's kissvec),
  so radiation is call-time stateless and nothing is serialized for it.

Cupy is imported lazily so the module (and the CPU manifest/roundtrip
tests) stay importable without a GPU.

#: Cross-step accumulators that are deliberately NOT checkpointed.
#:
#: A THIRD class, because two questions were being answered by one word and
#: they are different questions: "does this survive a checkpoint" and "is this
#: cross-step state that a run must not lose between steps".  ``serialize``
#: says yes to both and ``rebuild`` says no to both; these say NO to the first
#: and YES to the second, and until this class existed they had to be filed
#: ``rebuild``, which is read as "per-call work buffer" by everything that
#: consumes the classification for a purpose other than writing a restart
#: file.
#:
#: MEASURED CONSEQUENCE of the missing class, and the reason it now exists:
#: ``tilestream.physics_inventory.carrier_manifest`` builds the STREAMING
#: carrier set out of this classification (deliberately, so a field added to
#: woof tomorrow is streamed the day it is added).  Reading ``rebuild`` as
#: "not cross-step", it neither gathered nor scattered the two tracker
#: windows, so under a host store they were not in the store at all: each tile
#: buffer accumulated its own window over whatever tiles that buffer served,
#: at that buffer's coordinates, and the domain had no window anywhere.
#: ``tilestream/test_uh_stream.py`` is the gate; its ``carry_windows=False``
#: control reproduces the old inventory and must differ.
#:
#: The storm-following consumer windows (woof/core/uh_diag.py:
#: TRACKER_WINDOW_SLOTS) are the whole membership.  ``carry`` is their class
#: for every consumer of this table: an ORDINARY checkpoint does not write
#: one, so a run with no lifecycle to restore keeps the member set it has
#: always had, byte for byte.
#:
#: A NEST-LIFECYCLE run opts its own windows in per member instead
#: (:func:`write_tree_restart` -> :func:`_opted_in_scratch_manifest`), and
#: that is a writer decision, not a reclassification.  The old posture here
#: was that a window "restarts empty" because a checkpoint cannot know when
#: the consumer will next look; the restart-first ruling overrules it, and
#: the arithmetic says it can: the content is a max-fold since the
#: consumer's last reset, max is associative, commutative and rounding-free
#: on float32, so folding the persisted window and then the rest is bitwise
#: the unbroken fold.  An empty window at resume under-reads the next
#: spawn/retire/follow decision, which is a different trajectory, not a
#: shorter window.

#: children evaluating on different cadences must not blind each other by
#: sharing one plane.  Those names cannot be enumerated above: the set
#: depends on which children the experiment declares.
#:
#: MEASURED CONSEQUENCE of their having matched no class: ``classify_scratch
#: _slot`` is TOTAL by construction -- it raises on anything it does not
#: recognise, deliberately, so a new slot cannot be silently dropped from
#: every checkpoint -- and ``_scratch_manifest`` walks the LIVE pool through
#: it.  A run with a per-domain follow and ``restart_interval_s > 0``
#: therefore died at its first checkpoint instant, hours into the forecast,
#: having written no checkpoint at all.  ``carried_scratch_manifest`` walks
#: the same pool, so the streamed carrier set broke identically.
#:

#: it, on the REBUILT_SCRATCH_PREFIXES pattern, and taken FROM

#:   moves.  This follows it exactly.
#: * NOTHING CONSUMES IT is not the case.  WRF flags its own row ``rh``
#:   (Registry.EM_COMMON:1839) -- restart AND history -- so upstream
#:   carries it, and it lands in every wrfout frame here, which means a
#:   reader consumes it.  A frame reporting 0 W m-2 of outgoing longwave
#:   is not a missing value, it is a wrong one, and a reader has no way
#:   to tell: the same argument this tree already makes to refuse

    at all: it would resume against a different ``freezeH2O.dat`` or a
    different ``CCN_ACTIVATE.BIN`` with every identity check passing.  The
    scheme is table-driven to an unusual degree -- the activation fraction
    that sets droplet number is READ from ``tnccn_act``, not computed
    (module_mp_thompson.F:5229-5230 index it at fixed radius/kappa) -- so a
    silent table substitution is a silent trajectory substitution.

    Two inventories, deliberately kept apart.  ``classic_tables`` is the
    SAME four-asset set mp=8 pins, because mp=28 genuinely loads them (its
    adapter calls ``load_classic_device_tables`` and reuses the frozen mp=8
    sedimentation and classic-graupel launchers unchanged).
    ``aerosol_tables`` is the one asset only mp=28 reads, addressed by the
    path the run resolved rather than by ``root / filename``: woof ships the
    blob since 2026-08-01 but the file and root overrides let a run bind to a
    copy in a WRF ``run/`` directory instead, so its LOCATION is not part of
    the identity but its BYTES are.  Neither is the fact that it ships --
    see the note beside the record; a packaging fact in a trajectory identity
    only buys refused resumes.

    condition is ``thompson_init``'s synthetic CCN/IN profile
    (module_mp_thompson.F:493-551) when no aerosol dataset resolved.
    Since lane/wif-default the DEFAULT real-data mp=28 aerosol state is
    WRF's monthly WIF climatology, so a restart's aerosol fields are
    normally interpolated data and only fall back to the synthetic
    profile when the dataset was unavailable -- which the run receipt
    names (woof.config.MP28_AEROSOL_SYNTHETIC_FALLBACK).

    with the forecast to that point already spent.  Plan review answers the

    can be asked is once a domain has one.  The identity value is thrown
    away: what is bought is the refusal's placement.

    ASKED OF A :class:`~woof.core.physics.PhysicsDriver`, and of nothing
    else.  There is exactly one production attach site --
    ``woof/core/physics.py``'s ``state.physics = driver`` -- so a state
    carrying some other object is a route this identity is not defined

    instead of the route that attached the object.  Such an object meets
    the restart writer at its own door, unchanged by this gate.  A domain
    with NO driver is still asked: an active cumulus scheme without an
    attached driver is exactly one of the setups a checkpoint cannot name.

    Both forecast doors call THIS function rather than each writing the
    rule out: ``woof.core.model.execute_experiment`` (once per domain,
    parent-first, before step 0 -- and at activation for a domain that
    joins the tree after the run started) and
    ``woof.runtime.integrate_prepared_case``.  They had diverged -- the
    single-domain door asked unconditionally, so the foreign object the
    tree door deliberately skips raised there on an attribute -- which is
    the sort of difference that only shows up in whichever door the user
