"""Write a real wrfout frame from a 2-D surface snapshot.

Two lanes in this tree publish their forecasts as ``.npz`` and nothing
else, so the production renderer -- which reads wrfouts -- could not draw
them at all and both grew a matplotlib renderer of their own:

* ``tilestream/run_bigdomain.py`` writes ``bigdom_<n>_<tag>.npz``
  (``bigdomain_render.py``: *"cannot be pointed at a pinned host store, so
  it is not the tool for a domain that never becomes a wrfout"*);
* ``tools/da_cycle_prepared.py`` writes ``cycle/composites/legNN_*.npz``
  carrying ``refl_colmax``.

The fix is a writer, not a new reader.  ``.npz`` is a container with no
geolocation contract and no schema; teaching the Rust renderer to read it
would be exactly the per-format adapter the arbitrary-acceptance test
forbids, and the producing lanes already hold everything a wrfout needs.
``tilestream/output.py`` and ``tilestream/run_case_hrrr.py`` write real
wrfouts from the pinned store already; this is the same move for the two
lanes whose snapshot is 2-D.

## What the vertical axis means here

A surface snapshot has no profile, so these files are written with
``bottom_top`` of length 1 and the composite reflectivity stored as the
single ``REFL_10CM`` level.  The renderer's composite is the column
maximum, and the column maximum of a one-level column is that level, so
the product it draws is exactly the composite the lane computed -- not an
approximation of it.

That is a real limitation and it is stated in the file: ``GPUWM_VERTICAL``
is set to ``surface-snapshot`` and ``TITLE`` says so, so a reader who
opens one of these looking for a sounding finds the answer in the file
rather than in a wrong plot.  Anything that needs a profile must be
written from the model state, which is what
:class:`tilestream.output.StoreHistoryWriter` is for.

    ``LON``) are required -- without them the file has no geolocation and
    the renderer would have nothing to project -- and everything else is
    written when present.

    ## What reaches the file

    THE SHAPE DECIDES, not a table of names.  After the geolocation and
    the composite are placed, every remaining entry that is a 2-D array of
    this frame's own ``(ny, nx)`` grid is published under its own key
    (:data:`RENAME` supplies the name for the two keys whose wrfout
    spelling differs).  ``WrfoutWriter`` types an unknown ``(ny, nx)``
    field as ``f4`` and the render door draws any 2-D plane a wrfout
    carries, so there is nothing a per-field row would add -- and a lane
    that grows a carrier gets it in the wrfout without editing this file.

    Everything else is REPORTED, not dropped in silence:
    :class:`SurfaceWrfoutWrite` carries ``passed_through`` and a
    ``skipped`` map of key to reason, and the lanes print the second.
    The ``*_units`` siblings and the bookkeeping scalars (``elapsed_s``,
    ``nx``, ``ny``, ``nz``, ``dx``, ``dt``, and any other 0-d entry) are
    in neither: they are not fields, and naming them on every frame would
    bury the entry that matters.

    ``T`` is placed BEFORE the shape rule, because it is the file's
    structure rather than a stand-in for a measurement: a snapshot entry of
    the same name is reported as already written instead of replacing the
    mass coordinate with a surface plane.  The rotation pair
    (``SINALPHA``/``COSALPHA``) goes in after it, so a lane that knows its
    grid rotation publishes it.

    ## What the file does not invent

    A field the snapshot does not carry is not written as zeros.  THE
    BREAKAGE: this writer used to add ``HGT`` and ``MU`` as zero planes,
    and the renderer draws every plane a wrfout carries, so every frame
    drawn with the default product set got a Terrain Height map reading
    0 m across mountains and flat-zero ``wrf_hgt``, ``wrf_terrain`` and
    ``wrf_mu`` pictures: on a ``woof cycle`` boundary, four of the eleven
    pictures were of fields the frame did not hold.  MEASURED on ``rw_wrfbatch`` (2.8 line): a frame without the two
    reads and draws exactly its own planes (exit 0), and one without ``T``
    is refused, so ``T`` is the one placeholder the file needs.  A lane
    that has its terrain or column mass passes it (``HGT``/``HT``, ``MU``)
    and it is written as the measurement it is.

    A 2-D array on a grid that is not this frame's is the one refusal, and
    it is :func:`_plane`'s, unchanged: it names a field placed where it
    was not computed.

    The RUN ORIGIN is required too, and by the same argument.  Either
    ``global_attrs`` already carries one of :data:`ORIGIN_ATTRS` (which is
    what :func:`woof.io.wrfout.wrf_global_attrs` puts there) or
    ``start_time`` states it as a ``datetime``.  Neither is a refusal
    rather than a file, because a frame with no origin is refused by
    ``rw_wrfbatch`` after it is written and the lane that wrote it has
    already reported success.

    The composite reflectivity, if the snapshot has one, becomes the
    single ``REFL_10CM`` level; see the module docstring for why that is
    exact rather than approximate.

    ## What comes back

    The written path, and nothing a caller has to unwrap:
    :class:`SurfaceWrfoutWrite` extends ``Path``, so a caller that wants
    only the file uses the return value as the file, unchanged, and one
    that wants the report reads ``passed_through``/``skipped`` off the
    same object.
