"""Hand a WRF input file back to an in-place analysis, unchanged where
nothing changed.

The exchange this serves
------------------------
A variational or ensemble analysis that runs beside the model on CPU (the
kind that opens a WRF file, rewrites the fields it analysed and leaves
every other byte alone) owns the file's shape: its header, the alignment
its I/O library chose for the data section, and every variable it carries
that this model has no state for.  The model side of the exchange has two
duties:

* read the analysed file with every variable either mapped to model state
  or named as passed through (:func:`woof.ingest.wrfinput.read_wrfinput`
  and its ``ANALYSIS_PASSTHROUGH_WRFINPUT`` table), and
* write the file back so the next analysis reads the same file it would
  have read from its own model: same header bytes, same layout, the
  variables the model advanced carrying the model's values and every
  other variable carrying the bytes it arrived with.

:func:`write_back` is the second duty.  It never builds a file from a
schema.  It patches a copy of the file that was read
(:class:`woof.io.nc_writer_bridge.ClassicPatch`), so a variable nobody
rewrites cannot be dropped, reordered or retyped, and a write-back of the
values that were read is byte-identical to the file that was read.  That
identity is the test of the contract: it fails if the reader loses a bit
of any mapped variable, if a mapped variable has no way back, or if any
variable in the file is neither mapped nor named.

What it does not do
-------------------
It does not turn model state into WRF variables.  ``updates`` takes arrays
that are already WRF-named and WRF-shaped; producing them from a forecast
is the history writer's mapping and is wired by the caller.  Without
``updates`` the values written are the ones the reader restored, which is
the zero-step exchange.

Who moves the bytes: the Rust classic writer.  Python here decides which
variable takes which array and writes the receipt.
