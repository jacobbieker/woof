"""Which variables the history tape carries: the ``[output]`` surface.

A woof run writes its whole history inventory every period, and on a
four-domain tree at forecast cadence that is the thing that fills a
disk.  WRF's own answer is ``iofields_filename``; this is woof's, and
it is deliberately a SELECTION over the inventory the run already
produces rather than a second inventory of its own:

* the vocabulary is the UNION of the wrfout schema tables, both of them
  in :mod:`woof.io.wrf_output_schema` (``HISTORY_FIELDS_BY_NETCDF_NAME``
  and ``REGISTRY_VAR_META``, which the writer binds as ``_VAR_META``),
  so a scheme that adds a history field joins the vocabulary with its
  schema row and no code here changes -- the arbitrary-model test
  applied to variables;
* the presets are TABLES of names, so a new preset, or a new member of
  one, is a row;
* the filter is one predicate applied to the frame the writer already
  assembled, so there is no per-variable code path to grow.

THE DEFAULT IS THE FULL SET.  ``[output]`` absent, or ``preset =
"full"``, writes exactly what every run before this feature wrote --
same inventory, same order, same header -- and stamps no attribute of
its own.  Trimming is a thing a user asks for, never something a
default does to them.

WHAT IS NOT DROPPABLE, and why.  :data:`STRUCTURAL_FIELDS` is the
georeference, the vertical coordinate and the time coordinate: without
them no reader can place a value in space or time, so a file missing
one is not a smaller wrfout, it is an unreadable one.  Naming one in
``history_drop`` is refused with that sentence rather than served.

THE CHECKPOINT STREAM IS UNAFFECTED.  Checkpoints are separate files
written by :mod:`woof.io.restart` from model state, not from the
history frame, so a run that trims its history restarts exactly as it
would have.  ``tests/test_restart.py`` proves it, and the selection is
deliberately kept out of the restart identity for the same reason
``[tiles]`` is: it changes no number the model computes.

#: placing ANY value: the horizontal georeference (``XLAT``/``XLONG``),
#: the terrain and mass/vertical coordinate the eta levels are defined
#: against (``HGT``, ``ZNU``, ``ZNW``, ``P_TOP``, ``MUB``, ``PHB``), and
#: the time coordinate WRF tooling reads (``Times``, ``XTIME``,
#: ``ITIMESTEP``).  A wrfout missing one of these is not a smaller
#: wrfout; it is a file no tool in the estate can open as one.
#:
#: ``T`` IS IN THIS SET, AND IT IS HERE BECAUSE IT WAS MEASURED.  A
#: two-domain proof run whose 1 km child took ``preset = "minimal"``
#: wrote a d02 tape that ``rw_wrfbatch`` refused outright -- "Open WRF
#: ... failed and the file is not a supported post-processed WRF
#: archive" -- not a product skipped, the whole FILE rejected.  The
#: ladder was then measured against the real binary on a real frame,
#: one field at a time (``rw_wrfbatch --list-products``):
#:
#:   minimal (57 vars, no 3-D)      rc 1, the file does not open
#:   minimal + T (58)               rc 0,  30 products renderable
#:   minimal + T,P,PB (60)          rc 0,  38

#:   the full inventory (74)        rc 0, 162
#:
#: So ``T`` is the field that makes the difference between a readable
#: wrfout and a file the estate's own reader will not open, which is
#: exactly what this set is for.  It costs one 3-D volume, and a preset
