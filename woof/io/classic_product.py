"""A whole-file classic NetCDF product, written through WOOF's Rust.

:mod:`woof.io.wrfout` drives :mod:`woof.io.nc_writer_bridge` as a *tape*:
one unlimited record dimension, frames appended over time, the header frozen
the moment the first frame lands.  The gridded observation products are the
other shape entirely -- no record dimension, every variable fixed, the whole
file produced in one call -- and they declare their schema INTERLEAVED with
their data (``createVariable`` immediately followed by ``variable[:] = ...``),
which the tape's freeze-on-first-write rule cannot express.

This module is that second shape.  It collects dimensions, attributes,
variables and their values, and emits them at :meth:`ClassicProduct.close` in
declaration order: header first, as the classic containers require, then every
variable's slab.  The surface is the slice of ``netCDF4.Dataset`` the product
writers already use, so a writer ported onto it keeps its own shape.

What it does NOT buffer is a copy.  ``variable[:] = array`` stores a
REFERENCE; the cast to the declared external type happens one variable at a
time inside :meth:`close`.  A radial-velocity volume is hundreds of megabytes
and there is no reason for a facade to hold a second copy of every one of them
at once.

Holes are impossible by construction: the Rust writer refuses ``finish`` with
any fixed variable never written, and the classic container has no in-band way
to say "this region was never filled" -- an unwritten slab would read back as
whatever the filesystem left there.
