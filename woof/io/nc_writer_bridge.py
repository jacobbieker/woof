"""ctypes seam onto the Rust classic-NetCDF writer.

This is the write-side counterpart to :mod:`woof.netcdf_bridge`, which is
the read-side facade over ``rw_netcdf``.  The library it loads is
``tools/rustwx/crates/netcdf-writer``, a dependency-free emitter for the
NetCDF classic containers (CDF-1, CDF-2, CDF-5) with the full classic type
set, a record dimension and attributes -- everything a wrfout needs and
none of which the previous Rust writer (``rw-store``'s ``netcdf3.rs``,
CDF-2, ``NC_FLOAT`` only, no record dimension) could express.

Why ctypes rather than pyo3
---------------------------
Every Rust library woof already drives from Python is a cdylib behind
ctypes: ``gpuwm_preprocess_cpu`` (:mod:`woof.ingest.cpu_backend`) and
``region_global_dealias`` (:mod:`woof.obs.dealias_region`,
:mod:`woof.obs.coarse_cost`).  One loading discipline, one staging path
in ``tools/stage_wheel_bridges.py``, one ABI-marker rule in
:mod:`woof.bridges`, and no build-time bind to a CPython version.  A
pyo3 module would need a maturin build per interpreter and would be the
only artifact of its kind in the estate.

What this module does NOT do
----------------------------
It does not change what :class:`woof.io.wrfout.WrfoutWriter` writes with
today.  Flipping the product tape onto this writer is an integration step
with its own dual-write verification, and doing it here would mean
changing the product tape in the same commit that first introduces the
library that writes it.

Shape
-----
The calls mirror the netCDF C API on purpose, because the caller being
ported is written against netCDF4-python::

    from woof.io.nc_writer_bridge import ClassicSchema

    schema = ClassicSchema()                       # CDF-2 by default
    time = schema.def_dim("Time", 0, unlimited=True)
    strlen = schema.def_dim("DateStrLen", 19)
    south_north = schema.def_dim("south_north", ny)
    west_east = schema.def_dim("west_east", nx)
    schema.put_global_attr("TITLE", " OUTPUT FROM GPUWM")
    times = schema.def_var("Times", "S1", (time, strlen))
    t2 = schema.def_var("T2", "f4", (time, south_north, west_east))
    schema.put_var_attr(t2, "units", "K")

    with schema.create(path) as writer:
        writer.write_record(0, times, b"2026-08-16_00:00:00")
        writer.write_record(0, t2, field)          # C-contiguous f4

Adding a variable is a row in the schema table driving ``def_var``.  There
is no per-variable code path on either side of the seam.
