"""Minimal WRF-style "wrfout" NetCDF writer.

``WrfoutWriter`` lays out WRF-ARW dimensions/staggering and stamps each
variable with the WRF attribute set (``FieldType``/``MemoryOrder``/
``description``/``units``/``stagger``) so standard wrfout tooling can read
the files.  ``state_frame`` builds the standard frame dict from a
``DomainState`` (winds, T = theta - 300, PH/MU perturbations, the
terrain-consistent PHB/MUB/HGT base fields, and QVAPOR/QCLOUD/QRAIN when
the state carries moisture).  Active Morrison, precipitation, snow, Noah,
and vertical-coordinate history state is included under its WRF Registry
name.  ``wrf_time_str`` formats the ``Times`` record.  Only ``state_frame``
touches the GPU (deferred cupy import) -- the writer itself is
CPU-importable.

#: DOCUMENTED DIVERGENCE FROM WRF.  WRF v4.6.1 has no convention for
#: this.  ``share/output_wrf.F`` writes exactly two date globals --
#: ``START_DATE`` (this file's own start) and ``SIMULATION_START_DATE``
#: (the simulation's, held across restarts) -- and both are model-clock
#: times; the only provenance-shaped global it writes at all is
#: ``FLAG_RESTART`` on a restart file (output_wrf.F:379-381).  Nothing
#: upstream carries it either: metgrid's ``met_em`` globals are geometry,
#: land-use identity and ``FLAG_*`` presence bits, with no statement of
#: which cycle or which lead the fields came from (verified against the
#: reference bundle's own ``met_em.d01`` and ``wrfout_d01`` files).  So
#: WRF's convention is FOLLOWED where it exists -- ``START_DATE`` and
#: ``SIMULATION_START_DATE`` keep their WRF meaning untouched (which for a
#: delayed-start nest means two DIFFERENT dates; see
#: :func:`wrf_global_attrs`), and these
#: names are SCREAMING_SNAKE NC_CHAR/NC_INT globals like WRF's own -- and
#: the gap is filled in the ``GPUWM_`` namespace this writer already uses
#: for ``GPUWM_VERSION``/``GPUWM_FEEDBACK``.
#:
#: The names are the receipt's field names, uppercased and prefixed, so

    THE reader for a wrfout directory, and the reason there is only one:
    this module WRITES ``d05/episode-002/wrfout_...`` when a domain
    declares a lifecycle (see :meth:`PerDomainWrfoutWriters.submit`,
    which takes the segment from ``render_layout.episode_segment``), and

    what makes this walk safe to feed a RENDERER as well as the sweep,

    The walk goes through :func:`woof.render_layout.fs_path` and the
    results come back in the CALLER's spelling, for the same reason the
    picture walk does: a root's own length says nothing about its
    descendants', and a frame that cannot be enumerated is a frame that
    cannot be swept.

    The explicitly selected root may itself be a junction. Descendant

        ``frame`` is a COMPLETE host frame, already assembled, and it is the
        seam an out-of-core domain publishes through.  A streamed domain has
        no resident ``DomainState`` to read: ``woof.core.streaming.attach``
        copies the carriers into a pinned host store and the sweep writes
        the STORE, so ``state`` still exists, still has the right shapes,
        and still holds the values it held at t = 0 forever.  Passing it
        here is the shipped defect this parameter closes -- a full run's
        worth of frames that are correct in inventory, in Times and in
        global attributes, and frozen at the initial condition
        (``tilestream.test_history.negative_frame_from_state`` measures how
        much of a frame that freezes and requires it to differ).

        With ``frame`` given, ``state`` is not read at all -- pass ``None``
        -- and there is no D2H: the fields are already host arrays, so the
        side-stream staging this class exists for becomes a no-op and the
        writer thread is fed directly.  ``tilestream.output.StoreFrame``
        builds exactly such a frame off the pinned store, in the device
        frame's own field order (which is essential: HDF5 lays its name
        heap out in variable-creation order, and the same numbers in a
        different order give a file that hashes differently while every
        variable in it compares equal).

        THE FRAME'S ARRAYS ARE BORROWED, NOT COPIED, and that is the caller's
        problem to get right, exactly as it is for ``state``.  With
        ``StoreFrame(overlap=False)`` the carriers are zero-copy views of the
        pinned store -- which is what makes an out-of-core frame 2.2x-2.4x
        cheaper than the resident path -- so the caller must ``drain()``
        before it sweeps again, or use ``overlap=True`` and pay one host
        memcpy for a snapshot the writer thread may hold.  Submitting views
        and sweeping on writes a frame the scatter is mutating underneath;
        it is a property, not a race, and
        ``tilestream.test_history.negative_async_no_drain`` asserts it.

        ``global_attrs`` is a per-frame global-attribute override (carrier
        provenance above all); it rides the ticket so the snapshot taken at
        submit time lands on exactly the file that carries this frame.
