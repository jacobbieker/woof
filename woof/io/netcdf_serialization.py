"""The one lock every netCDF4/HDF5 session in this process takes.

netCDF4 releases the GIL around HDF5 calls and the shipped HDF5 library
is not thread-safe, so two Python threads inside it at once is a crash,
not a race that merely produces wrong numbers.  :mod:`woof.io.wrfout`
has serialized its own writer sessions on this basis since the async
writer landed; the lock lived there, which meant it protected the writer
against itself and against nothing else.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS, measured: a two-domain run with a relocating
1 km child died with SIGSEGV or SIGBUS immediately after
``wrfout_d01_..._12_40_00`` was written, in 3 of 8 full runs, always at
the same point -- the 2400 s relocation.  ``faulthandler`` on the SIGBUS
put the main thread at ``woof/core/rrtmgp.py`` opening
``rfmip-clear-sky-inputs.nc`` inside the RRTMGP state being rebuilt for
the moved child, while a ``gpuwm-wrfout-*`` writer thread sat in
``validate_wrfout_file`` reopening the tape it had just published.  Two
threads inside HDF5, one of them holding a lock the other had never
heard of.  Nine frames on disk out of fourteen, on both the release line
and the lane, so it is neither adaptive- nor relocation-specific: any
netCDF4 read that lands beside a publish can do it.

The rule this module exists to make enforceable: EVERY netCDF4 session
in this process is opened under :data:`NETCDF4_IO_LOCK`.  It lives here
rather than in ``woof.io.wrfout`` so that a reader in
``woof.core`` can take it without importing the writer.
