    The longwave delta is a PER-DOMAIN substitution, not a constant: the

    longwave off (0), and carries any other admitted longwave selection
    unchanged -- so under the resolved RRTMG (4, 4) pair the delta
    collapses and both arms run 4.  ``ghg_input=0`` stays stock-only in
    both cases: on the (0, 1) suite it fixes the substituted RRTM's gas
    table, and on the (4, 4) suite it mirrors the fixed-gas configuration
    the native arm runs on EITHER engine -- ``woof/core/rrtmg_legacy.py``
    pins it in its switch table, and the RTE+RRTMGP arm selects one annual
    mean CO2 for the run's calendar year (``woof/core/rrtmgp.py``).
    Pinning it is mandatory either way: WRF's default ``1`` reads the
    time-varying CAM gas table and is not a valid implicit substitute for
    the fixed-gas configurations used by the acceptance gate.

    ``do_radar_ref=1`` is the second stock-only key and is mandatory for
    the same class of reason: it is a setting the native arm answers in
    CODE rather than from a namelist, so the native file must stay
    silent about it while the stock file has to be told.  woof
    evaluates REFL_10CM at output time unconditionally; WRF allocates
    the array only under ``package radar_refl compute_radar_ref==1``.
    At WRF's default the stock arm's history frames carry no REFL_10CM
