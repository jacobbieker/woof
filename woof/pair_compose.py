"""Compose matching product PNGs from two runs into labeled pair sheets.

``woof render --pair A_DIR B_DIR`` takes two directories of rendered
product PNGs -- either engine's output -- and writes one side-by-side
sheet per product the two runs have in common, plus a ``manifest.tsv``
recording exactly which files each sheet was composed from.  This is
the campaign's paired-comparison flow (its compositor is preserved
byte-for-byte in the campaign receipts) generalized to any two runs:
labels and title come from the caller or default to the directory
names, never to any particular experiment's wording.

Matching key: everything after the rust engine's ``_fNNN_`` lead marker
-- the domain token and the product slug together -- else the whole file
stem (the matplotlib engine's naming, where identical product/domain/
valid-time stems pair naturally).  The domain stays *in* the key on
purpose: a directory can now hold several nests of one run, and pairing
a 3 km panel against a 333 m one would be a comparison of nothing.

Pillow is the only dependency, and no woof extra ships it.  It
arrives with matplotlib, a base dependency, so a bare install already
has it; an install that somehow does not meets
``woof.capabilities.PILLOW`` at the door, in ``_pair_main``, before
any directory is read.  A reader sent to an extra for Pillow would
install a wheel that cannot supply it, so no message here names one.
No science is performed either way: pixels are pasted, never
recomputed.
