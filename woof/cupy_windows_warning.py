"""CuPy's false "CUDA path could not be detected" warning on Windows.

On Windows, ``import cupy`` (CuPy 14.0 to 14.2) runs
``cupy._environment._setup_win32_dll_directory``, which asks for one CUDA
root folder and, when it gets none, writes::

    cupy/_environment.py:286: UserWarning: CUDA path could not be detected.
    Set CUDA_PATH environment variable if CuPy fails to load.

With the CUDA 12 toolkit that CuPy's own ``[ctk]`` extra installs from pip,
it never gets one.  cuda-pathfinder finds NVRTC in
``site-packages/nvidia/cuda_nvrtc/bin``, and CuPy names a root only for the
CUDA 13 wheels' single ``nvidia/cu13`` folder, so the CUDA 12 wheels'
folder-per-library layout reads as "no CUDA path".  Setting ``CUDA_PATH``
does not change that: CuPy 14.2 does not read the variable itself, and
cuda-pathfinder searches site-packages before it, so the wheel's NVRTC is
found first either way.  Nothing is missing, either: CuPy loads NVRTC and
its math libraries through cuda-pathfinder from those same wheels, which is
how every Windows install of the engine runs.  CuPy's
maintainers removed the step as obsolete (cupy/cupy#10044, commit 54522ab);
no released CuPy carries that removal yet.

The breakage this prevents: every engine command on the Windows managed
runtime, the desktop's own install, wrote the warning to stderr before doing
anything else, and the desktop shows a failed command's stderr as its error
text, so every failure a desktop user saw opened on a CUDA warning that was
not true.

:func:`quiet_false_cuda_path_warning` ignores that one warning exactly when
it is false: on Windows, when a site-packages folder cuda-pathfinder searches
holds the CUDA 12 wheel's NVRTC.  Anywhere else it is left alone, because an
install with no toolkit wheel may really be unable to find CUDA, and the
warning is the first sign of it.  ``woof/__init__.py`` calls it, so it is in
place before any woof module imports CuPy.

Retire this module when the runtime's CuPy floor is a release without
``_setup_win32_dll_directory`` (cupy/cupy#10044).
