"""Declarative WRF v4.6.1 physics-combination authority.

The tables in this module are a transcription of WRF v4.6.1 commit
``d66e442fccc04111067e29274c9f9eaccc3cef28``.  They deliberately separate
WRF's verdict from WOOF implementation readiness: a WRF-legal tuple may
still have a named WOOF structural blocker, but WOOF must never describe
that blocker as a WRF incompatibility.

Only the schemes ported by this release are represented.  Keeping the
cross-product dimensions and citations here makes admission a table lookup,
not a collection of subtly different front-door conditionals.

# dimension it also publishes said (0, 1, 3) -- one artifact
# contradicting itself.  Nothing on a run path reads the cumulus axis, so

#: selectable and published by the registry this module generates while the
#: matrix dimension said (0, 1, 3), and nothing compared the two.  An
#: axis's represented set plus its rows here must equal the selectable set
#: exactly (``tests/test_authority_agreement.py``), so a newly ported
#: scheme has to do one of two things -- join the axis with its citation,
#: or say here why it cannot -- and neither can be forgotten.
#:
#: A blank reason is not a row.  These are not refusals (nothing on a run
#: path consults this module for any of these values); they state what the
