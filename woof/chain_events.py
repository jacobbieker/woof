"""What `woof go` cost, on disk, without anyone asking for it.

THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES, measured 2026-08-16.  `woof go` already times
every stage it runs -- it prints ``ok fetch (11s)`` and hands the same
number to an optional observer -- and a bare `woof go`, which is what
everybody types, had no observer, so every one of those numbers died
with the scrollback.  Answering one sentence's worth of question ("how
long from launch to sim step 1?") took a wrapper's timestamps, terminal
prose, proof.json, report.json and progress.jsonl assembled by hand.
Nothing the product writes answered it.

`woof run-plan` -- the least-used front door -- already wrote exactly
the right artifact: an append-only ``events.jsonl`` at
``gpuwm.run-plan.event.v1`` with ``stage_started``/``stage_finished``
carrying wall seconds.  So this module invents no format.  It attaches
that same :class:`woof.runplan.EventStream`, with that same grammar and
that same reader (:func:`woof.runplan.read_events`), to the front door
people actually use.

Three things are deliberate:

**It is not a host.**  ``hosts_forecast`` is False, so the forecast
stays the subprocess it has always been -- process isolation is what
keeps a CUDA failure inside one stage, and telemetry must not be the
reason a chain gives that up.  ``woof run-plan`` passes its own
observer, which does host, and this one steps aside for it entirely.

**The stage names are `go`'s chain, not run-plan's five.**  ``boot``,
``authority``, ``fetch``, ``manifest``, ``prepare``, ``forecast``,
``render``.  The envelope and the tag set are run-plan's; the stage
vocabulary belongs to the chain being described, and a consumer switches
on ``event`` (closed) and reads ``stage`` (open) exactly as it already
does for the HRRR chain's phases.

**Every number is relayed from an artifact.**  Fetch bandwidth is read
back out of ``fetch-manifest.json``; the forecast's internals are read
back out of ``progress.jsonl``; time to first plot is read back out of
the early render's receipt while the pictures it names still carry that
instant, and off the pictures' own mtimes otherwise.  Nothing here
re-derives a number a stage already published, and nothing here quotes a
number the published tree contradicts -- see :data:`TTFP_DEFINITION`.
