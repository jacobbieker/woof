"""Hash-bound composition of mapped products on compatible donor grids.

``rw-wps.mapping.v1`` describes one source format and the canonical field
semantics, but a meteorological archive may split those fields across product
files with different geographic extents.  This module implements the first
strict composition slice: an invariant GRIB terrain product whose regular
latitude/longitude grid contains the primary forcing grid as an exact
coordinate subset.

The join is intentionally narrow.  It does not fabricate terrain, treat WRF
target ``HGT_M`` as source terrain, or silently interpolate between donor
grids.  Mapping, composition, data, provenance, and native decoder bytes are
verified before and after decoding.  The terrain selector and unit conversion
remain owned by the sealed mapping document.  The same contract is used for
GRIB1, GRIB2, and NetCDF. Soil source geometry, target geometry, remapping,
and ocean repair are declarative and contain no source-family dispatch.

Cross-source composition extends the same contract across PACKAGED SOURCES:
a composition may declare that a canonical field's values come from a
DIFFERENT source's decode (soil from a physical analysis under an
AI-forecast atmosphere, and in general any declared field borrowed across
products).  The grammar is per-field source bindings in
``field_sources``: each binding names the contributing source id, pins that
source's OWN sealed mapping document by SHA-256, and declares a
grid-alignment and a cycle/time-alignment rule.  The primary mapping
declares each borrowed field as ``provider: "composition_bound"`` so the
gap is a declaration, never an absence.  Same-grid contributions (an exact
coordinate subset) land; a cross-grid contribution refuses by NAMING the
horizontal regrid capability this composition does not have; a
member-bearing donor refuses by naming member alignment; a vertical-bearing
borrow on a different ladder refuses by naming vertical alignment.  The
contributing mapping document is deliberately NOT a row of the input
manifest: the composition itself pins it by hash, and the manifest pins the
composition, so the donor's table version is bound transitively while the
manifest schema stays v1.  Provenance receipts name every contributing
source with its hashes.

    A cross-source composition additionally supplies each contributing
    source's own sealed mapping document under its declared
    ``mapping_role`` via ``contributing_mappings``; the observed bytes must
    hash to the SHA-256 the composition pins for that binding.  The
    contributing data files ride ``supplement_files`` and the contributing
    provenance documents ride ``provenance_files``, each under the
    binding's declared role, so the input manifest binds every byte it
    always bound; the contributing mapping itself is pinned by the
    composition (which the manifest pins), not by a manifest row.

    ``scratch_destination`` is the output directory of the preparation
    this decode feeds, when the caller has one: the engine's compose
    scratch -- the whole composed frame stream, tens of GB for the
    largest sources -- is created beside it instead of in the system
    temp, which is RAM-backed tmpfs on common Linux boxes and killed the
    bare default prep of the biggest registered source with a disk
    quota error.  ``WOOF_COMPOSE_SCRATCH`` overrides it; omitted
    entirely, the system temp remains the documented fallback for
    callers with no real output directory.
