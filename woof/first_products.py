"""Render the first committed frame while the forecast is still running.

Time to first plot is this product's headline number, and for most of a
short-cycle run it is spent on things that have nothing to do with the
picture: the download, the preparation, the model's own spin-up.  By the
time the forecast stage opens, the one frame a reader most wants to see
-- the analysis at t = 0, the state the run was initialised from -- is
already durable on disk.  The history alarm is true at t = 0
(:meth:`woof.core.clock.Clock.history_due`), so that frame is written
before a single step is integrated, and the per-domain writer raises
``output_committed`` the instant it has been fsynced, self-validated and
renamed onto its final name.

Until now that frame waited for the finalize stage, and finalize waited
for the whole forecast.  On a two-hour run that is minutes of a finished
picture sitting on disk unlooked-at.  This module renders it as soon as
it lands, on a worker thread, concurrent with the forecast that produced
it, and the run's event stream carries the wall time from
``plan_accepted`` to the moment the pictures were readable -- the TTFP
number, measured by the engine itself, on every run's receipt.

Four properties make that safe rather than merely fast.

**The renderer never touches the card.**  ``woof render`` is a separate
``python -m woof.cli render`` process which drives the Rust
``rw_wrfbatch`` binary (or matplotlib); it imports cupy as a transitive
dependency of the package and creates no CUDA context -- measured, with
``cuCtxGetCurrent`` returning ``CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED`` after the
render front door is fully imported.  The forecast owns the GPU for its
whole run; this contends for CPU, page cache and disk only.

**The command is the finalize stage's own.**  It is composed by
:func:`woof.go_cli.render_command` out of the same plan dict, and run
with the same working directory and the same ``PYTHONSAFEPATH``
environment, differing only in naming one frame where finalize names all
of them.  Byte-identity between a frame rendered early and the same
frame rendered at finalize is therefore a property of construction
rather than a coincidence -- and it is pinned by a test that renders
both ways and compares the bytes.

**Nothing half-written is ever published.**  The render runs into a
scratch directory underneath the render output, and each picture is
moved onto its final name with :func:`os.replace` only once the
subprocess has exited.  A reader watching the render directory sees a
complete PNG or no PNG, and a finalize render that later writes the same
name cannot collide with a write still in flight.

**Finalize skips only what it can prove is already there.**  The early
render leaves a receipt naming the frame it read and every picture it
wrote, all by sha256.  Finalize drops that frame from its own list only
when the frame still hashes to the recorded digest, every recorded
picture is on disk hashing to its recorded digest, and the product spec
has not changed since.  Anything else -- a moved file, an edited one, a
different ``--products`` -- and the frame is simply rendered again.

Telemetry never fails a run.  Every entry point here swallows its own
exceptions into a ``warning`` event: a forecast that completed must not
be turned into a failure by the picture of its first frame.

    analysis frame was being drawn kept 155 to 171 of the renderer's
    staging files as its pictures: ``rustwx_wrf_..._<product>.png`` and
    ``var_wrf_isltyp_<hash>.png`` lying flat in ``png/``, against the
    render folder ruling, and the banner and report counted them as
    pictures drawn.  The engine draws every picture flat under a name of
    its own and only then files it into ``<domain>/<product>/<day>/``;
    a render stopped in between leaves the flat names behind and writes
    no receipt for them.

    So, on a stop, once every render this run started has ended: every
    PNG in the folder that no render receipt names
    (:func:`receipted_pictures`) is removed, and so is the renderers'
    working scratch.  What stays is the organised tree of pictures a
    render finished and vouched for, and the frames themselves, which
    draw again with ``woof render`` at any time.

    Only a caller that has ENDED every render may call this: a render
    still running would lose the pictures it has drawn and not yet
    receipted.  Never raises; ``{"removed": [...], "errors": [...]}``.

    THE DECISION, recorded where it is enforced: a run that did not
    finish KEEPS its pictures.  The early render draws the analysis
    frame while the forecast is still integrating, and a child that then
    stops -- non-finite, a refusal mid-run, an interrupt -- used to have
    those pictures removed, so the only artifact a reader could look at
    disappeared at the exact moment it became the thing they wanted.
    The frames prove what happened; the pictures are what a reader can
    actually see, and they are cheap to keep.

    What replaces the removal is a SENTENCE, in the two places this
    function writes: a banner at the top of this directory and the
    status in the render summary beside it.  A picture with no verdict
    beside it is the state this function exists to prevent.

    IN THE REPORT TOO, where the run leaves one.  A child that stops
    inside its forecast publishes ``report.json`` whatever stopped it,
    carrying its failure capsule or the sentence the banner carries
    where the stop composed none, and both stop arms record what this
    function did in that document's ``products`` block: ``status``
    ``KEPT``, the count on disk and the banner's path.  This function
    does not write the report -- it returns what it did, and the caller
    that holds the report puts it there -- so the folder, the summary
    and the document cannot disagree about how many pictures there are.

    Best effort, exactly as the removal was.  A banner that cannot be
    written is not worth failing an already-failed run over: the count
    still comes back, and ``banner`` is ``None``.  The summary is
    stamped either way -- two independent writes, because the summary
    is the document the readers key on and a banner's failure says
    nothing about whether the status can be recorded.

    A STOP (``requested``) says so in the banner's first line, and
    ``discard`` first removes what a stopped render left
    (:func:`discard_stopped_render`), so the count below covers only
    pictures a render receipt names.  The caller passes ``discard`` only
    once every render the run started has ended.
