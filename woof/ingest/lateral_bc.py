    """The positions of ``count`` forcing times, START TIME LAST.

    WHO STILL USES IT.  The preparations that build every forcing time
    before anything is published: the domain-tree (hierarchy) arms of
    ``woof/mapped_direct.py``, ``woof/gfs_direct.py`` and
    ``woof/era5_direct.py``, the single-domain ERA5 arm with a
    water-temperature overlay (its receipt binds every forcing time into
    the cache identity), the met_em route (``woof/metem_forecast.py``)
    and ``woof/runtime.py``.  Every other single-domain preparation
    builds the start time FIRST instead, writes it into the prepared head
    and releases it before the next time
    (``woof/ingest/boundary_stream.py``), which holds the same one time.
    This guard retires when those routes are chained too.

    THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO CLOSE.  A prepare loop that walks its
    forcing times in time order has to hold the START time for the whole
    loop: it is the first one built and the last one used, because the
    prepared cache, the wrfinput export and the surface analysis are all
    written from it after the boundaries are complete.  Every LATER time
    is then interpolated and initialized underneath it, so two complete
    full-domain analyses and two complete states coexist at the peak
    while only one of them is being worked on.  Priced by
    ``woof.core.preflight.estimate_ingest`` at 800x800x49 with mp=10 and
    three GFS forcing times, that second resident time is 14.67 GiB of
    device residency against 7.66, and it carries the phase's peak
    envelope from 15.86 GiB to 23.92 -- which is to say, it is the
    difference between preparing that domain on a 16 GiB card and dying
    in preprocessing after the whole forcing chain has already been
    downloaded.

    Building the start time LAST costs nothing and removes it.  Every
    earlier time contributes its perimeter frames to
    :class:`StateBoundaryFrames` -- host memory, O(perimeter) -- and is
    released before the next one is interpolated, and the start time is
    then the only state that is ever retained.

    Reordering the WORK cannot reorder the ANSWER.  The frames are
    accumulated against their own position (``add_state(..., index=)``)
    and the intervals are assembled from them in TIME order whatever
    order they arrived in, and the accumulator is a pure function of that
    sequence.  The bit-for-bit equality is pinned by
    ``tests/test_ingest_prepare_ordering.py``.

    :func:`build_state_lateral_boundaries` needs every initialized state at
    once, so an N-time ingest had to hold N complete model states -- and the
    N horizontally interpolated snapshots that produced them -- before a
    single boundary number existed.  That, not the forecast, is what made
    preprocessing the memory-binding phase.

    This accumulator takes one state, keeps only the four
    ``spec_bdy_width`` perimeter frames it will actually write, and lets the
    caller drop the state immediately.  At a 414x330x49 root with nine
    forcing times, ALL nine times of frames come to 0.13 GiB of host
    memory against the 1.50 GiB one forcing time occupies on the device.

    :meth:`build` is exact, not approximate: for the same states and times
    it returns element-for-element what the all-at-once builder returns.
    The retained frames are the same ``ascontiguousarray`` slices
    :func:`_field_boundary` would have taken, and the tendency is the same
    float64 ``(after - before) / duration`` over the same two operands.

    A frame may be added AGAINST ITS POSITION rather than in arrival
    order (``index=``), which is what lets a prepare loop build its
    forcing times in the order that keeps only ONE of them resident --
    see :func:`start_last_forcing_order` for the residency this buys and
    what it cost before.  :meth:`build` sorts by position, so the

    # positive-definite scalar stage applied the ring's vertical advection,
    # which WRF computes and never applies
