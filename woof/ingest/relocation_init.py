"""Real-data child rebuild at a new placement (statics-on-move, leg 3).

The 2026-08-06 requirement (project ruling, via the WRF moving-nest discussion): a
relocated nest's STATIC fields -- terrain, landuse, soil categories --
must be REBUILT for the new footprint from the nest's own static source
at nest resolution, never inherited parent-interpolated, because
over-land storm-following at 2 km lives on resolved terrain.  This
module is the initializer that satisfies it on the real-data routes, and
it is deliberately assembled from the SAME machinery the t=0 nest cold
start uses (:mod:`woof.ingest.nest_init`) rather than a re-derivation:

1. **Footprint-rebuilt statics.**  :func:`woof.static.build.
   build_static_for_domain` is footprint-parametric and is invoked for
   the new footprint (plus the ``[static.highres]`` overlay when the
   case enables it, whose tile cache makes repeat moves cheap).  The
   footprint's grid comes from :meth:`ProjectedGrid.translated` -- the
   reference grid moved by an exact whole number of its own cells -- so
   a cell two placements share evaluates to bitwise-identical
   coordinates and therefore bitwise-identical statics (identical
   source + identical cells = identical bytes).  That equality is what
   lets the bitwise overlap transplant survive a statics rebuild, and
   the route's preparer ASSERTS it on every move rather than assuming
   it.

2. **Fresh-strip atmosphere on the new terrain.**  The atmosphere at
   move time exists only in the live parent, so the child is filled by
   the ordinary full-parent SINT (:func:`~woof.ingest.nest_init.
   parent_only_init`) and then adjusted to the rebuilt fine terrain by
   the SAME sequence the t=0 real child runs after its own fine-terrain
   analysis: the analytic fine base (``_make_real_base``), WRF's
   three-operand terrain blend (``blend_terrain`` on ht/mub/phb against
   the parent SINT captures), ``adjust_tempqv`` for the base-column-mass
   change, the ``start_domain`` base/EOS re-derivation, and the
   real-nest ``press_adj`` MU correction -- one call,
   ``_adjust_and_rederive``, reused verbatim.  On overlap cells outside
   both placements' blend frames this reproduces the t=0 base bitwise
   (the analytic base is a per-column pure function of the terrain
   bytes), which is what keeps the donor-alignment instrument armed.

3. **Blend frames resplit against the rebuilt base, and must.**  Inside
   the two placements' blend frames the child base states genuinely
   differ -- ``blend_terrain`` makes a cell's EFFECTIVE terrain a
   function of its ROW, so a move that changes a column's row changes
   the ground under it.  The perturbations are carried BITWISE anyway
   (WRF's ``mediation_nest_move.F`` does exactly that), which lets the
   column totals change by the base-state slab between the two effective
   terrains -- the mass and heat of the air below the old numerical
   floor.  :func:`rederive_after_transplant` (installed as the
   initializer's ``post_transplant`` hook) counts the base-changed cells
   and re-derives the EOS.  Preserving the totals there instead REFUSES
   that slab and manufactures a hydrostatic hole; it was built, measured
   on Melissa's Andes-frame move, and retired.  See that function.

4. **Land state moves by donor fill.**  Soil, snow and surface fields
   live on the physics driver, outside the serialised-state transplant;
   leg 1's contract moves them with a second transplant against the
   same plan, and the newly exposed strip is filled from its nearest
   same-landmask-class donor inside the overlap
   (:func:`donor_fill_plan`), with the counts recorded on the move
   receipt.  The route-side driver rebuild lives in
   :class:`woof.runtime.RealRelocationChildPreparer`.

Nothing here decides when or where to move.  A restart across a move is
no longer refused and no longer promises nothing: it reproduces the run
that wrote the checkpoint bit for bit, which puts this module's fill on
the resume path as well as the live one.  See
:data:`woof.core.nest_relocation.RESTART_ACROSS_MOVE_POSTURE`.

    effective terrains, which is the mass, heat and geopotential of the

    A totals-preserving alternative was built here first, and it is

    meant to prevent.  Preserving column totals across an effective-

    (2025-10-22 02:00, d02's southern blend frame on the Colombian

    terrain -- and the model surface 100 m below the ground

    non-finite six d02 steps later.  Carrying the perturbations bitwise
    survived the same move on the same bytes.  Over water the two
    behaviours are identical -- fine and parent terrain agree, the base
    bytes match, there is nothing to split differently -- which is why
    every ocean-track case was blind to the difference.

    The base-changed cells are still counted per pair, per move: the
    counts are the receipt's statement of how much ground changed role,
    and a nonzero count over water would again be the wiring defect the
    old instrument was hunting.  The EOS diagnostics are then re-derived

    ``reference_grid`` is the child's grid as originally placed

    grid translated by an exact whole number of child cells, which is
    the construction that makes footprint-rebuilt statics bitwise-equal
    on shared ground (see the module docstring).  The returned
    ``initialize(new_dc, parent_node, ...)`` satisfies
    :func:`woof.core.nest_relocation.relocate_child`'s initializer
    contract, states its provenance, scopes the donor-alignment
    instrument to the region where its invariant is defined
    (``donor_alignment_frame_width``), and installs the post-transplant
    EOS re-derivation as its ``post_transplant`` hook.

    WHERE THE STATICS COME FROM is the one route-owned seam.  The
    case-data route holds its input ``catalog`` (the GEOG source) and
    rebuilds per footprint through ``build_static_for_domain``; the
    prepared routes hold no ingest inputs and pass ``statics_builder``
    instead -- a callable ``(grid, new_dc) -> fields`` (the sealed
    statics-corridor crop, :func:`woof.static.corridor
    .corridor_footprint_statics_builder`) carrying ``static_provenance``
    and ``source_label`` attributes for the receipt.  Everything after
    the statics -- the SINT fill, the t=0 terrain adjustment, the
    re-derivation hook -- is one implementation, never forked per route.
