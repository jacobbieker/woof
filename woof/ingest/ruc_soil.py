"""WRF ``module_soil_pre.F`` soil ingest for the RUC LSM's soil levels.

This is ``init_soil_depth_3`` (:1153-1194) and ``init_soil_3_real``
(:1817-2158) of WRF v4.6.1 ``share/module_soil_pre.F``, the pair
``process_soil_real`` (:817-830) selects when ``sf_surface_physics ==
RUCLSMSCHEME``.  It is a separate module from :mod:`woof.ingest.soil`
because RUC's geometry is not a longer version of Noah's:

* Noah's ``zs`` are layer **midpoints** and its ``dzs`` are the layer
  thicknesses those midpoints sit inside.  RUC's ``zs`` are **level (node)
  depths**, and the shallowest one is ``0.0`` -- the ground surface itself,
  not the centre of a layer.  A RUC soil value is the value *at a depth*, not
  the mean *over a slab*.
* RUC's ``dzs`` is a derived control volume around each node, and WRF's
  derivation is not a partition of [0, 3] m -- see :func:`ruc_soil_depths`.

Everything here is ``float32``, in WRF's own expression order, because the
reference this module is measured against is WRF's own ``REAL`` arithmetic:
``woof/data/ruc/oracle/soil_ingest.csv``, produced by
``tools/ruc_soil_ingest_wrf461_oracle`` driving the byte-unmodified routines.
Computing in float64 and rounding once is a third function, neither float32
nor correctly rounded, and it is how this project has produced real bugs
before.

Two WRF behaviours are deliberately NOT reproduced.  Both are refused with an
error instead, and both refusals are proved against oracle rows that show
what WRF does:

1. **An unsorted layer source.**  ``init_soil_3_real``'s sort (:1881-1899,
   :1913-1931) permutes ``st_input(1..n)``, but a layer source lives in
   ``st_input(2..n+1)`` -- WRF itself puts it there
   (``share/module_optional_input.F:1364-1370``) and then writes the skin
   temperature into slot 1 and the deep temperature into slot n+2.  The sort
   therefore permutes the wrong slots and drags uninitialised memory into the
   soil column.  The oracle's ``era5_layers_reversed_adj`` rows show the
   result: soil temperatures of order -1e29 K.  metgrid emits its levels
   shallow-to-deep so WRF never trips over this, but a source adapter that
   does not is silently corrupted rather than told.
2. **A zero-moisture land column under the moisture adjustment.**
   :2079 divides by ``0.9*smtotr``; with an all-zero source profile
   ``smtotr`` is zero and the quotient is 0/0.  The oracle's
   ``era5_layers_adj_nosst`` column 10 records what this toolchain then
   returns from ``MAX(0.02, NaN)`` -- 0.02 -- but that is a property of
   gfortran's ``maxss`` operand order, not of Fortran, and a soil column
   whose value depends on it is not a number this project will ship.

    ``source_geometry`` is ``"layers"`` for a slab source that reaches WRF as
    metgrid's ``FLAG_SOIL_LAYERS=1`` (ERA5, GFS), and ``"levels"`` for a node
    source already on RUC's own depths (``FLAG_SOIL_LEVELS=1``; a RUC-native
    or HRRR grid).  The two are not interchangeable and WRF's two arms differ
    in more than bookkeeping:

    ``"layers"``
        ``source_levels_cm`` are the layer MIDPOINTS in whole centimetres,
        which is how WRF's reader forms them -- ``char2int2``
        (``share/module_optional_input.F:1949-1954``) and the
        ``flag_soil_layers`` block (:1339-1352) both compute
        ``(top + bottom) / 2`` in INTEGER arithmetic, so a 0-7 cm ERA5 layer
        is sampled at 3 cm, not 3.5 and not 7.  The profile is then anchored
        at 0 m by the skin temperature and at 3 m by the deep temperature
        (:1899-1907), and moisture is anchored at 0 m by a linear
        extrapolation off the top two layers and at 3 m by repeating the
        deepest (:1938-1948).
    ``"levels"``
        The nodes are the samples, with no anchors at all.  A target level
        outside them is an error, not an extrapolation.

    ``source_depth_scale`` is the integer unit ``source_levels_cm`` is
    carried in, declared by the source's own remap policy
    (:func:`woof.ingest.soil_contract.ruc_soil_remap_policy`).  The
    default 100 is WRF's own: ``char2int2``
    (``share/module_optional_input.F:1949-1954``) forms soil level depths
    by integer division into CENTIMETRES and :1994 divides the INTEGER by
    100, so every metgrid-shaped source runs at 100 and is bit-identical
    to the oracle.  A producer whose published ladder is finer than a
    centimetre (ICON's shallowest interior node is 0.005 m) declares a
    finer scale rather than being refused: the limit at 100 is metgrid's
    file format, not the soil column, and rounding 0.5 cm onto the 0.0 m
    node would hand :1958-1968 two samples at one depth.  The arithmetic
    is unchanged -- ``REAL(level)/scale`` in the same float32 expression
    order.

    ``moisture_adjustment`` is WRF's ``flag_sm_adj`` (namelist default 0,
    ``Registry.EM_COMMON:2537``).  It applies only to a layer source
    (:2067) and rescales the top ``num_soil_layers - 1`` levels so their
    ``dzs``-weighted bucket matches the source's own four-layer bucket
    divided by 0.9, then floors each at 0.02, then -- if moisture rises
    with depth across the top three levels -- multiplies levels 1-5 by
    :data:`_MOISTURE_DAYTIME_FACTORS`.  The deepest level is never adjusted.

    The surface bookkeeping -- the land/water/sea-ice partition, the lake
    override, the SST and TSK repair, the TMN repair, the 271.4 K sea-ice
    deep temperature and the SNOW/SNOWH reconciliation -- is
    ``dyn_em/module_initialize_real.F`` and ``share/module_soil_pre.F``'s
    surface half, which WRF runs identically for every ``sf_surface_physics``.
    So this function CALLS :func:`woof.ingest.soil.preprocess_noah_soil` for
    it rather than restating it.  That is deliberate and it is what makes
    "Noah initialization is bitwise unchanged" a structural property instead
    of a measurement: the Noah routine is not edited, not copied and not
    parameterised, only called.  Its four-layer TSLB/SMOIS/SH2O are then
    DISCARDED, and the soil column is rebuilt from the source profiles by
    :func:`remap_soil_to_ruc_levels`, which is ``init_soil_3_real``.

    Three divergences from stock ``real.exe``, each with a reason:

    ``flag_sm_adj``
        Not applied.  ``woof.config.RUC_OPTION_IDENTITY_EVIDENCE`` admits
        only ``flag_sm_adj = 0``, so ``moisture_adjustment`` is False here and
        the two must not drift apart.

    the open-water fill
        ``init_soil_3_real:2131-2144`` writes SST into TSK on every water
        column with no validity test, and stock ``real.exe`` then aborts a few
        hundred lines later at ``module_initialize_real.F:3283`` on any gap in
        the SST analysis -- measured at 10.4% of the water cells of one
        production coarse-domain frame.  ``preprocess_noah_soil`` has
        already resolved TSK to the valid SST wherever one exists and to the
        skin temperature where it does not, so this seam takes WRF's
        **no-SST** arm against that already-repaired TSK.  The result equals
        WRF's wherever WRF would not have aborted.

    sea ice
        Left to the runtime.  ``LSMRUC:862-895`` resets SOILMOIS, SMFR3D,
        SH2O, KEEPFR3DFLAG and ``min(271.4, TSO)`` on every sea-ice column on
        **every** step, not once at initialization, so writing an ice column
        here would be overwritten before it was read.  Noah's four-layer
        equispaced ice profile is therefore not carried over; TMN is, because
        ``preprocess_noah_soil`` sets it to 271.4 K on ice and RUC reads TMN
        as the bottom boundary at ``LSMRUC:1057``.

    ``landmask``, ``terrain`` and ``source_orography`` are the ERA5/mapped
    initializers' soil seam, with :func:`woof.ingest.soil.
    preprocess_noah_soil`'s exact semantics: the static-build landmask is
    the terrestrial/water decision surface (WRF's ``process_soil_real``
    drives every branch with ``grid%landmask``, never the met-source
    LANDSEA), and terrain/source_orography (all-or-none) arm WRF's
    ``adjust_soil_temp_new`` elevation lapse.  That lapse is applied by
    ``process_soil_real`` to TSK and to EVERY ``st_input`` level BEFORE
    either ``init_soil_*_real`` arm runs, so it is scheme-independent:
    the Noah call below returns the adjusted TSK anchor, and the same
    float64 increment -- computed by the same helper on the same decision
    surface, lakes excluded -- is added to the RUC source temperature
    samples (layer or level form alike) before the float32 remap.
    Moisture and the 3 m deep anchor are not adjusted, exactly as on the
    Noah path.

    ``num_soil_layers`` reaches :func:`ruc_soil_depths`, which refuses
    anything but 6 or 9.  woof's CUDA leaves index a nine-element
    ``__constant__`` table, so a six-level request is refused further in.

    ``soil_mesh`` is the sub-source-cell reconstitution
    (:mod:`woof.ingest.soil_downscale`).  It is applied HERE, to the source
    profiles, and NOT forwarded to the Noah call below -- deliberately, and
    for the two reasons this whole seam exists.  Noah's four layers are
    discarded a few lines later, so downscaling them would be work thrown
    away and an advisory printed twice; and RUC's air-dry and saturation
    constants are ``SOILPARM.TBL``'s ``STAS-RUC`` block, not ``STAS``, so the
    ratio has to be formed against the table the scheme itself integrates.
    The Noah call therefore stays bitwise what it was.

    This is the one seam every initializer calls, and it exists because the

    unconditionally with no land-surface selector in sight -- so a
    ``sf_surface_physics=3`` request was initialised on Noah's four layer
    midpoints, silently, and the nine-level remap beside it was dead code.

    **Fail-closed on the selector, not on the shape.**  An unrecognised
    ``sf_surface_physics`` raises here rather than falling through to Noah.
    That direction matters: the failure this replaces was not a crash, it was
    a complete plausible forecast on the wrong soil discretization.  The
    shape check downstream (``_as_soil``) would have caught a four-layer array
    handed to a nine-layer allocation, but only as an unexplained broadcast
    error, and only for the schemes whose counts differ.

    ``soil_no_source_land`` is the horizontal snapshot's mask of land the
    source holds no land for (an island in a source area of open sea).
    Those cells carry METGRID.TBL fill_missing in ``fields``, and they take
    :func:`woof.ingest.soil.island_soil_columns` instead, before either
    geometry reads its source profiles, so every scheme builds its levels
    from the same column.  ``None`` or an empty mask changes nothing.
