#: mp=28's moist list is character for character mp=8's -- the aerosol-aware
#: scheme adds only ``scalar:`` members -- so the mass-species handling is
#: the same at both, and that identity was verified against :3024 and :3036
#: directly rather than assumed from the mp=8 arm.
#:
#: mp=50 is the second narrow package, and narrow in the other direction
#: from Kessler's: P3 one-category HAS qi and has no qs and no qg at all,
#: because it carries ONE ice category and predicts rime mass fraction and
#: rime density (``scalar:qir,qib``, :3038) instead of splitting the frozen
#: mass into snow and graupel.  ``woof/core/state.py:464-497`` allocates no
#: qs and no qg on an mp=50 state, so retaining five species here would not
#: merely be wrong about the scheme, it would write into fields that do not
#: exist.  Its number moments (qni/qnr) and its rime pair are Registry
#: ``scalar:`` members that no real-data source read here supplies, so they
#: stay at the allocator's exact FP32 zero and P3 owns their first update --
#: the same source-absent policy mp=8/10/16/18/28 already take for their own
#: scalars, and the scheme is defined at that zero and says so: it floors
#: nitot at ``nsmall`` before any mean size is taken
#: (phys/module_mp_p3.F:2572-2573) and zeroes an unsupported rime pair in
#: ``calc_bulkRhoRime`` (:6799-6813).
#:
#: mp=9 is the first package WIDER than the decoded inventory: Milbrandt-Yau
#: carries hail mass beside graupel (``moist:qv,qc,qr,qi,qs,qg,qh``, :3025),
#: so it retains all five decoded species and discards nothing.  The seventh
#: member has no decoded source -- the native HRRR decoder reads exactly
#: QC/QI/QR/QS/QG (woof/ingest/hrrr.py:47), hail among them nowhere --
#: and real.exe's own QH arm agrees about what that means: the
#: interpolation at dyn_em/module_initialize_real.F:1979-1997 runs only
#: under ``flag_qh``, which a source that supplies no QH never raises, so
#: stock real.exe leaves QH at its allocated zero for this source too.
#: ``qh`` therefore stays at the allocator's exact FP32 zero
#: (woof/core/state.py mp=9 arm) exactly like the scheme's six number
#: moments (``scalar:qnc,qnr,qni,qns,qng,qnh``, :3025), which no real-data
#: source read here supplies either -- the same source-absent policy
#: mp=8/10/16/18/28 take.  The scheme is defined at that zero and says so:
#: its moment-consistency pass prescribes each number from its own mass
#: wherever Qx>epsQ and Nx<epsN, before any process rate is formed
#: (phys/module_mp_milbrandt2mom.F:1444-1530 -- N_c_SM for cloud at
#: :1459-1460, the No_r_SM/No_g_SM/No_h_SM intercept inversions for rain,
#: graupel and hail, Cooper for ice, Nos_Thompson for snow), so analyzed
#: mass entering with zero moments gets the scheme's own prescribed size
#: distributions on the first call rather than undefined arithmetic.

#: The microphysics ids whose WRF Registry ``moist:`` package can receive the
#: decoded HRRR analyzed hydrometeor inventory, so the decoder must supply it.
#:
#: This is ONE tuple on purpose.  It was three separate literals, and mp=28
#: was added to none of them: an mp=28 real-data run reached
#: :func:`initialize_real` with QC/QR/QI/QS/QG present in the snapshot, never
#: declared them required, never shape-checked them, never interpolated them,
#: and produced a condensate-free initial state from a cloudy analysis with
#: no error anywhere.  A single name makes that class of omission impossible.
#: mp=50 then reproduced that failure verbatim: the tuple was already a
#: single name, and P3 was simply never added to it, so a decoded native
#: HRRR analysis initialized an mp=50 forecast with qc/qr/qi identically
#: zero and nothing raised.  mp=9 was the third recurrence: Milbrandt-Yau's
#: package holds every decoded species and two more Registry members
#: besides, yet with 9 absent from the tuple an mp=9 real-data run started
#: with all five mass species identically zero,
#: ``hydrometeor_initialization`` empty, and nothing raised -- the same
#: condensate-free start from a cloudy analysis.  The ids are now exactly
#: the keys of HRRR_ANALYZED_HYDROMETEOR_MOIST_PACKAGE above, and the
#: retention each one gets is read from that same mapping instead of from
#: a ladder here.
#:
#: Kessler and P3 are members even though their packages are narrower than
#: the decoded inventory, because real.exe still requires the decoded
#: inventory and then discards what the ACTIVE package lacks
#: (WRF_REAL_PACKAGE_ABSENT_SPECIES_POLICY below); mp_physics=0 is refused
#: outright above.
#:

#: integer sets and would go blind on a comprehension -- can still see this

    above zero, an installed analysed NC/NR/NI, is kept as real.exe keeps
    it.  Before the seed the entry block was handed zero numbers and

    WRF real's default vertical operator is the second-order Lagrange
    polynomial (``lagrange_order=2``), and a second-order polynomial
    through three non-negative samples undershoots below zero when the
    middle one is a sharp minimum: a dry slot a few levels deep between
    moister layers -- the ordinary shape of a mid-tropospheric dry
    intrusion in a model's own column -- puts a NEGATIVE mixing ratio on
    the target level that lands inside it.  On the RH lane that value
    never surfaces, because ``rh_to_mxrat1`` floors everything it returns
    at ``qv_min_value``; on the use_sh_qv lane real.exe skips
    ``rh_to_mxrat`` and writes the negative to wrfinput
    (:data:`_PROGNOSTIC_QV_FLOOR_WRF_REFERENCE`).  This function makes the
    two lanes agree: cells the operator took below zero are floored at the
    identical constant, under WRF's own ``qv_min_p_safe`` condition, and
    receipted.  Cells the operator left at or above zero are untouched, so
    no artifact that passed before this floor existed moves.

    bounded undershoot envelope for the source it mapped

    the MAPPED field at :func:`_specific_humidity_to_mixing_ratio`), so a
    negative here is an interpolating polynomial's own -- this vertical
    operator's undershoot, the horizontal one's carried into it, or the
    surface undershoot carried up one layer -- and not evidence about the
    forcing.  A negative at or above ``qv_min_p_safe``, where WRF's
    conditional rule does not reach, is floored the same way and counted
    apart (``floored_cells_at_or_above_qv_min_p_safe``): the RH lane's
    ``rh_to_mxrat1`` floors at 1e-6 there too, unconditionally, and the
    refusal this replaced named no breakage a floored value would cause,

    d(phi)/phm/LOG(pfd/pfu)`` (F:4002-4010), all in the FP32 arithmetic
    the device kernel uses.

    "Matches the runtime EOS" is the whole contract, so the two
    cancellations calc_p_alpha stopped spelling are gone from here too:
    the layer thickness is the exact FP32 base difference plus the
    float64 residual the state carries as ``dphb_resid``, and opt 2's log
    ratio is ``log1p((pfd - pfu)/pfu)`` off the float64-differenced
    coefficient drops.  Measured on the 12-level hybrid opt-2 probe in
    tests/test_hypsometric.py (``_real_base_inputs``, terrain 200-350 m),
    re-diagnosing with the operator calc_p_alpha actually runs: quantizing
    against THIS operator leaves 1.46 ulps of the target alpha, quantizing
    against the pre-change one leaves 15.17 -- a tenth of that test's
    16-ulp bound versus within 5 % of it.  The search would otherwise be

    from source metadata. An empty tuple declares no analyzed mass fields;
    absent species retain WRF's allocated zero. None uses the snapshot's
    declaration when present, otherwise preserving the established native
    caller contract, including its required five-species inventory.

    ``analyzed_number_fields`` declares flagged metgrid QNI/QNC/QNR/QNS/QNG/QNH
    inputs. They use WRF's same linear Q vertical operator and selected scalar
    package, with the supplied NAME_SFC surface pseudo-level. They do not contribute condensate to
    the pressure recurrence. Omission retains source-absent initialization.

    ``analyzed_surface_fields`` selects supplied NAME_SFC mass pseudo-levels.
    Native HRRR callers retain their established exact-zero surface policy.

    ``boundary_species`` names the hydrometeor masses (state names) the
    SOURCE publishes on every forcing frame, read from its table row
    (:func:`woof.boundary_fields.mapping_boundary_species`,
    :func:`woof.boundary_fields.source_boundary_species`).  Those this
    initializer installs from the analysis, with the number moments the
    cold start seeds from them, join the state's lateral-boundary
    inventory, so the root's specified boundary carries the analysed
    cloud, rain, ice, snow and graupel instead of draining them.  The
    default, none, keeps water vapour only (WRF's have_bcs_moist off).

    ``landmask`` is the target grid's static LANDMASK (1 land, 0 water).
    An mp=28 cold start reads it as WRF's XLAND where a cloudy cell holds
    no aerosol, because real.exe's make_DropletNumber then sizes the
    droplets by land or water; such a start without it is refused.

    The pressure-level/RH lane requires TT, RH, GHT, UU, VV, PSFC, T2,
    exactly one of D2 or RH2, U10, and V10.  Native HRRR requires
    per-column PRES, SPFH, and Q2, and for
    WSM6/Thompson/Morrison/NSSL-2 requires analyzed QC/QR/QI/QS/QG.
    Kessler requires the same decoded inventory, retains QC/QR, and records
    WRF-real's explicit active-moist-package discard of QI/QS/QG.  MP off is
    refused because it cannot faithfully retain the five analyzed species.
    Classic
    Thompson retains the five analyzed HRRR mass categories, and its
    source-absent QNICE/QNRAIN moments are seeded as real.exe seeds them:
    make_RainNumber and make_IceNumber where rain or ice mass is present
    and the number is at or below zero, exact zero where there is no mass.
    Aerosol-aware Thompson (mp_physics=28) retains the same five
    categories -- its Registry moist package is character for character
    mp=8's (Registry.EM_COMMON:3024 vs :3036) -- adds nc, seeded from
    make_DropletNumber the same way, and deliberately leaves
    nwfa/nifa/nwfa2d/nifa2d at exact zero for ``microphysics_init`` to
    fill from thompson_init's
    synthetic profile; ``RealInitResult.aerosol_initialization`` is the
    receipt for that hand-off.  WRF's default
    ``use_sh_qv = .false.`` vertically interpolates HRRR RH and then diagnoses
    qv. Omitted ``use_sh_qv`` follows the snapshot's explicit
    ``specific_humidity_authority`` metadata; unmarked sources keep WRF's
    False default. An explicit boolean overrides that declaration. With
    ``use_sh_qv=False``, RH is diagnosed from the already horizontally mapped
    SPFH, temperature, and pressure exactly where real.exe handles FLAG_SH.
    Surface fields build WRF's ``use_surface`` pseudo-level that anchors
    every vertical-interpolation column.
    ``source_orography`` is mandatory for ``sfcp_to_sfcp`` unless the
    horizontal snapshot carries catalog-resolved ``SOURCE_OROGRAPHY``.
    ``preprocess_backend`` selects the interpolation engine independently of
    ``state_backend``.  The latter defaults to ``'cuda'`` so a GPU forecast
    may use CPU transforms and still receive the historical device state.
    Native export callers select ``state_backend='preprocess'``: CPU
    preprocessing then retains the completed setup/export state in NumPy
    host memory, while CUDA preprocessing keeps it on device.
    ``initial_perturbation`` is an optional
    :class:`woof.ingest.init_perturbation.InitialStatePerturbation`:
    when present its theta bubbles are applied once to the final
    theta/qv columns before alpha/geopotential are formed (constant
    analyzed pressure and column mass, geopotential rebalanced -- the
    em_quarter_ss convention) and the per-bubble application stats are
    returned as ``RealInitResult.initial_perturbation``.  ``None`` (the
    default) runs not one instruction of that path.
    ``column_workers`` is how many host threads the float64 setup columns
    use; ``None`` (the default) is every CPU this process may run on for a
    card preparation, and the preparation's worker count (at most eight
    unless named) for a CPU-backend one. Every count gives the same bytes.
    ``boundary_only`` marks a forcing time whose state only feeds the
    lateral boundaries: its caller keeps the state and drops the result's
    receipts, so the hydrometeor vertical disposition receipt, one operator
    replay per source level over the whole domain, is not built for it.
    The state is the same either way.
