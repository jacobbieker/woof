"""WRF's ``smooth_cg_topo``: the root terrain blended toward the source's.

WRF v4.7.1 ``&domains smooth_cg_topo`` (Registry.EM_COMMON:2301, logical,
scope 1, default ``.false.``).  With it on, real.exe replaces the outer
rows of domain 1's terrain with the INPUT MODEL's terrain and ramps back to
the high-resolution terrain over the next ``blend_width`` rows
(dyn_em/module_initialize_real.F:716-762 calls ``blend_terrain``,
dyn_em/nest_init_utils.F:712-785, with ``grid%toposoil`` -- the source's
SOILHGT on the d01 grid -- as the coarse field).  Every later forcing time
reuses the first time's blended terrain (``ht_smooth``, :754-761), so the
initial state, the lateral boundaries and the terrain the forecast
integrates all stand on one blended surface, and the specified zone's
boundary values are no longer interpolated onto terrain the input model
never saw.

The comment WRF carries beside the call is the reason for it: "This
smoothing is similar to the coarse/nest interface.  The outer rows and
cols come from the existing large scale topo, and then the next several
rows/cols are a linear ramp of the large scale model and the hi-res topo
from WPS."  Domain 1 only; a nest's terrain is already blended toward its
parent's by nest initialization.

WRF refuses the request when the input carries no SOILHGT (:729-738,
"The field SOILHGT is required when smoothing the CG topography on d01"),
and so does this module.
