"""WRF-order initialization for real and parent-only child domains.

The real-data path is the scope-trimmed ``med_nest_initial`` transaction
ratified for Phase 5 (WRF v4.6.1 ``share/mediation_integrate.F:509-952``):

1. ERA5-direct initialization on the child's own grid and unblended fine
   terrain, including Noah soil/skin/landmask preprocessing;
2. SINT capture of only the parent ``ht``/``mub``/``phb`` blend operands;
3. ``blend_terrain`` on all three operands;
4. ``adjust_tempqv`` for the base-column-mass change; and
5. a ``start_domain`` analogue that reconstitutes the analytic base fields,
   reruns the equation-of-state diagnostics, and applies the nest-only
   ``press_adj`` column-mass correction.

The Noah result is deliberately produced before SINT/blending and is never
adjusted afterward.  That is WRF fidelity, not an omission: real.exe builds
the land state on fine terrain before wrf.exe blends the nest, and WRF has no
post-blend soil adjustment.

All SINT outputs and adjustment work arrays are init-only plain temporaries.
They are intentionally absent from the step-scratch registry and become
unreachable when initialization returns.
