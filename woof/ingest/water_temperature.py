"""Assemble the finished water-surface temperature before soil preprocessing.

Why this module exists
----------------------
The shipped chain chose a water temperature PER CELL, between two fields
that were mapped by two different algorithms::

    water_temperature = where(finite(SST) and 170 <= SST <= 400, SST, SKINTEMP)

SST reaches the target through METGRID.TBL's ``sixteen_pt+four_pt``, and both
of those operators require every point of their stencil to be usable.  An SST
analysis carries no values over land, so within two source cells of any
coastline the stencil is incomplete, both operators decline, and the target
takes ``fill_missing=0.``.  Zero is not a temperature, so the selector above
reads it as "no SST here" and switches that column to SKINTEMP -- which over
lakes is ERA5's FLake model state, several K warmer than the analysis and
quantized on the 0.25 degree source cell.

The consequence is a lake painted as a quilt of two source fields joined at
the SST-validity boundary.  Measured on the reproducing case (Lake Erie,
1985-05-31 12Z, 24 km parent with a ratio-8 3 km nest) by
``tools/water_temperature_probe.py``, over the nest's 4195 water cells and
the 7915 adjacencies between them, with the shipped operators:

===============================================  ===========================
quantity                                         value
===============================================  ===========================
water cells taking SST                           1955 (46.6 %)
water cells taking SKINTEMP                      2240 (53.4 %)
adjacent-step P99 across the water               7.81 K
adjacent-step P99 INSIDE the SST region          0.13 K
adjacent-step P99 INSIDE the SKINTEMP region     0.85 K
adjacent pairs straddling the boundary           397, median jump 5.64 K
===============================================  ===========================

Each adjacency is counted once.  Restricted to Erie itself (the largest
connected body, 2684 cells) 257 of the 269 steps above 1 K sit exactly on the
switch boundary, which is the attribution: neither field is rough on its own,
and the discontinuity is manufactured by switching between them.  So the
remedy is to stop switching: decide ONE provider for a whole connected body
of water and interpolate that provider coherently across it.

What this module guarantees
---------------------------
* Surface classes come from the target statics: land is ``LANDMASK >= 0.5``,
  lakes are the land-use table's own inland-water category (``ISLAKE``),
  ocean is the remaining water.
* A lake and the ocean can never share a connected component, so a lake can
  never be handed ocean water.
* Donors for a component are drawn from that component alone.  There is no
  global search, so a landlocked lake with no analysis of its own cannot
  import another basin's water.
* Every water cell is attributed in ``WATER_TEMP_SOURCE``.
* A source can additionally declare lake-model water and ice state. Where
  the lake has no usable analysis of its own, explicitly ice-free model
  water supplies the cells where that provider is admissible. Declined
  cells use the component skin field and are counted in the receipt. This
  represents the source model's local lake state even where its grid does
  not resolve that lake, without searching for another basin's water.
* A water cell its provider still leaves without an admissible
  temperature is filled, never refused: from its own body's water, else
  from the nearest source water on the domain, else from the skin
  temperature around it.  That is the one place a body can take another
  basin's water, and only for a body the route hands no admissible
  temperature of its own.  Every such cell is counted and named in the
  receipt's ``water_fill`` and in the advisory.  The masked skin chain
  no longer hands a lake 0 K where the source holds no water (it takes
  the source's land skin there, see
  ``woof.ingest.horiz._skin_temperature_on_both_surfaces``), so this
  is what keeps a route that maps its skin some other way from refusing
  a lake over its source's coverage.

Where the guarantee is enforced
-------------------------------
Not route by route.  :func:`require_assembled_water_temperature` is called by
the soil preprocessing routers, which are the single seam every forcing route
already crosses, and it REFUSES a mapping that still carries a raw SST beside
its SKINTEMP with no assembled field to consume.  A new forcing source
therefore cannot reintroduce the per-cell fuse by omission: it either routes
its own statics through :func:`assemble_for_route` or it is refused by name.
