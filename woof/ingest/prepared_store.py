"""The prepared cache, loaded straight into a pinned host store.

The resident road -- :func:`woof.ingest.prepared_cache.restore_prepared_cache`
followed by :func:`woof.ingest.hrrr_physics.initialize_prepared_physics` --
builds ONE full-domain ``DomainState`` on the card and then lets
:func:`woof.core.streaming.attach` copy it, carrier by carrier, into pinned
host RAM.  Every byte of that state is dead the moment the copy finishes: a
streamed forecast integrates out of the store and never reads it again.  It is
also the ceiling.  MEASURED on a 16 GB card, nz = 49: the bare state costs
11 276.5 B per column and the prepared case about 15 780, so 1024 x 1024
refuses inside ``initialize_physics`` while the forecast it would have fed
needs about 6 GiB and would have run comfortably.  The streamed engine on the
same card has stepped 2624 x 2624.

This module removes the intermediary.  It reads the cache one ROW SLAB at a
time, builds a slab-height state, attaches physics to THAT, and scatters the
result into full-domain pinned host arrays -- so the largest device
allocation in a preparation is one slab, and the domain the card can carry
stops being a property of the card at all.

:func:`tilestream.bigdomain.build_store_by_slabs` already does exactly this
for an analytic initial condition, and this is deliberately its structure:
price the manifest, refuse before the first pinned byte, then fill.  The two
differences are both about where the rows come from.

*The rows come off disk, not out of a sounding.*  The cache's integrity
guarantee is a SHA-256 over each array WHOLE. Read-only memory maps are
checked against the manifest and hashed directly by the Rust CPU bridge,
then those same maps serve the slab rows. Older bridges retain the checked
full-array read before serving mapped rows. Rows use read-only memory maps,
so what stays resident is page cache the kernel may evict rather than a
process that has swallowed its own input.  Neither pass puts anything on the
device at domain shape.  See :class:`_CachePayload` -- holding the payload
whole would have cost about 11 GiB of prognostics at 1024 x 1024 x 49 on top
of the 9 GiB store, and multiplied on every stretch rung above it.

*Physics is attached per slab.*  The cache carries
``STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS`` only -- the dynamics and microphysics prognostics.
Everything the store also needs (``fields/*``, ``driver/*``, ``cumulus/*``,
``scratch/*``) is made by ``initialize_prepared_physics``, which is
column-local given windowed inputs: its one apparent reduction,
``GREENFRAC.min(axis=0)``, is over the twelve MONTHS and not over space.  The
two places a slab could disagree with the domain are named and handled --
``center_lat`` is passed down explicitly rather than re-derived from the
slab's own grid (``initialize_landuse`` reads it for the LANDUSE.TBL season),
and the y-staggered inputs take one extra row so the ``V10`` face average at
a slab's last row sees the same neighbour the whole domain would.  The
``topo_wind = 1`` terrain laplacian also uses one neighbour row on each
side before its coefficients are retained in the geography store.

That the two roads agree is not argued from this docstring: a domain small
enough for both produces bit-identical frames, which is the parity gate.

    buffers are built by -- and :func:`tilestream.driver.geography_inventory`
    key them, which is what :class:`tilestream.driver.TiledRun` requires of
    both.

    ``base`` is the WHOLE domain's base state, and the word to hold onto is
    DOMAIN-SHAPED rather than domain-invariant.  Flat terrain makes it look
    invariant -- :class:`woof.core.grid.BaseState` is then a scalar ``mub``
    and 1-D profiles that broadcast against any height -- but with terrain
    ``mub`` is ``(ny, nx)`` and ``pb``/``alb``/``thb``/``phb`` are full 3-D
    ``(nz[,+1], ny, nx)`` arrays.  Every slab is therefore built against a
    ROW-WINDOWED copy (:func:`_slab_base`), while the bundle carries the
    un-windowed original: a consumer holding this object wants the DOMAIN's
    base state, not whichever slab happened to be built last.

    ``template`` is a SLAB-HEIGHT state, not a domain-shaped one.  It exists
    because :func:`woof.core.streaming.prepared_tile_state_factory` reads
    three things off "the domain": its scheme adapters (to twin per buffer),
    its vertical coordinate, and the ``ndim < 2`` half of its setup arrays.
    All three are identical at every height -- the eta table does not vary by
    row -- so a slab carries them faithfully and costs a fraction of a

    An omitted row count uses :func:`default_slab_rows`, whose bounded
    column count keeps a wide grid's initialization within the same memory
    contract its tiles are planned against. Explicit counts remain available
    to partition/parity probes and callers with their own priced policy.

    ``physics_initializer`` optionally initializes a caller's existing
    physics contract on each row window. It receives the same inputs as
    ``initialize_prepared_physics`` plus ``row_start`` and ``domain_rows``
    for windowing caller-owned setup fields. The default is unchanged.

    ``reader`` may be the checked start-state reader of a chained head.
    Its ``boundary_source`` is retained lazily on the host, so each tile
    takes a checked interval only when the model reaches that seam.

    ``cache_payload`` may retain a sealed direct preflight's already-hashed
    immutable mappings. Its reader, current header and file identities must
    still match. Other callers keep the ordinary verification path.

    No domain-shaped device array is ever allocated.  The peak device
    residency is one slab's state plus its physics; the peak HOST transient
    beyond the store itself is one full-domain array, because that is the
    unit ``PreparedCacheReader`` can verify against its digest.

    The budget guard is ``build_store_by_slabs``' and runs in the same place:
    the whole request is priced from the manifest the first slab reveals, and
    :func:`tilestream.hoststore.check_allocatable` refuses BEFORE the first
    ``alloc_pinned_array``.  A guard that fires on the way up has already
    taken most of what it is refusing, and pinned pages cannot be swapped.

    ``inventory_fn`` IS THE RULE THE TILE BUFFERS ARE BUILT BY, and it is a
    parameter rather than a literal so that the store and the buffers cannot
    be given two different ones.  It defaults to
    :func:`woof.core.streaming.streamed_store_inventory` -- the exact
    callable ``store_domain_builder`` and ``prepared_domain_builder`` hand
    :func:`woof.core.streaming.attach` -- and :class:`tilestream.driver.
    TiledRun` compares the two inventories key for key before it steps.
    Harvesting each slab with ``physics_inventory.carrier_inventory``
    instead cost the store exactly one carrier: ``scratch/refl_10cm`` is
    REBUILT scratch, excluded from the plain manifest BY CONSTRUCTION, so
    ``prime_lazy_carriers`` allocated it on every slab and nothing collected
    it.  MEASURED, before the first step: ``TiledRunError: tile state
    inventory [143] != store inventory [142] ... in TILE not in STORE:
    ['scratch/refl_10cm']``.
