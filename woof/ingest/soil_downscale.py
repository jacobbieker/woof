"""Sub-source-cell downscaling of the initial LAND soil state.

Why this module exists
======================

A forcing model delivers its soil state on its own mesh -- 0.25 degree for
GFS and ERA5 -- and the horizontal stage carries it to the model grid with
WPS's ``sixteen_pt`` overlapping-parabolic interpolant.  That interpolation
is correct: it is a faithful transcription of ``geogrid/src/interp_module.F``
and it is what WPS metgrid does.  What it CANNOT do is invent information
below the source spacing, so every interpolated soil field is a smooth
surface fitted inside each source cell, joined to its neighbours with a
curvature break on the cell boundary.

Nothing downstream fixes that, in WPS/WRF or (until this module) here.  The
consequence is measurable and visible.  On a 3 km European domain forced by
GFS 0.25 degree, a 16-term bicubic fitted inside each source cell explains
``SMOIS`` layer 4 at R2 = 0.99972 and ``TSLB`` layer 4 at 0.99978: those
fields hold essentially ZERO information below 0.25 degrees.  Terrain
(``HGT``, 0.90691) and land use (``LU_INDEX``, 0.51153) measured the same way
DO hold sub-cell information, so the instrument is not simply reporting
smoothness.  ``SMOIS`` never relaxes -- it is a prognostic reservoir -- so the
source mesh stays in the forecast, and it reaches the screen: soil moisture
controls the latent heat flux, the latent heat flux controls 2 m humidity, and
the 2 m dewpoint over land ends up quilted into rectangles 0.25 degrees on a
side (16.8 km by 27.6 km at 53 N).  Correlation between block-scale dewpoint
and block-scale soil moisture reaches +0.41 through the first five forecast
hours, tracking the latent heat flux (+0.415) and collapsing after sunset,
which is the fingerprint of an evaporative pathway rather than a plotting
artifact.

Deliberate divergence from WRF
==============================

**What WRF does.**  ``real.exe`` takes metgrid's interpolated ``SM``/``ST``
layers and uses them as-is.  ``module_initialize_real.F`` adjusts soil
TEMPERATURE for terrain (``adjust_soil_temp_new``, ``module_soil_pre.F``
:993-1073) and floors pathological soil MOISTURE at a constant 0.005
(``account_for_zero_soil_moisture`` :3363-3395), but at no point does it
consult the target grid's own soil texture, and it never rescales moisture.
The soil texture WRF hands Noah (``ISLTYP`` from geogrid's 30 arc-second
STATSGO/FAO dataset) and the soil moisture it hands Noah are therefore
INCONSISTENT with each other by construction: a cell whose 30 arc-second
texture is sand receives the volumetric water content of a 0.25 degree cell
that was mostly clay, which for the same physical wetness is a different
number.  Stock WRF quilts soil moisture exactly like this.

**What woof does.**  Volumetric water content is not the quantity the two
grids share; the dimensionless wetness of the soil is.  So the moisture is
carried across the resolution change as Noah's own degree-of-saturation
ratio and reconstituted against the target grid's texture::

    SRATIO  = (SMC - SMCDRY) / (SMCMAX - SMCDRY)     source-cell texture
    SMC_new = SMCDRY_t + SRATIO * (SMCMAX_t - SMCDRY_t)     target texture

``SMCDRY`` (``SOILPARM.TBL`` DRYSMC) and ``SMCMAX`` (MAXSMC) are the same
air-dry and saturation constants Noah itself uses, and ``SRATIO`` is
literally Noah's direct-evaporation variable (``module_sf_noahlsm.F``:1214).
The source-cell texture is the area mean of the target grid's own texture
parameters over one source cell, because the same 30 arc-second database
describes both meshes and its cell mean is what a 0.25 degree cell can
represent.  Nothing new is fetched and no new dataset is introduced.

**Why this is better and not merely different.**  Three reasons.

1.  It is the only operation available that puts REAL sub-source-cell
    structure into ``SMOIS``.  Smoothing the interpolated field (WPS's
    ``smooth_option``) removes the curvature break and the visible facet
    edges but leaves the block-scale amplitude untouched, because it adds no
    information -- it is cosmetic, and this module is deliberately not that.
2.  It makes soil moisture and soil texture mutually consistent, which is
    what Noah's own hydrology assumes.  Handing Noah a wetness the texture
    cannot support is how a sandy cell starts the forecast at an impossible
    saturation.
3.  It conserves water.  Because the reconstitution is affine in ``SRATIO``
    and the source-cell texture is the cell MEAN of the target texture, the
    source-cell mean of the result equals the source value it came from,
    exactly, whenever ``SRATIO`` is uniform in the cell -- and to within a
    fraction of a percent in practice.  See ``soil_water_change_pct`` on the
    receipt, which every run reports.

**How to reproduce stock WRF.**  Declare, in the experiment TOML::

    [ingest]
    soil_texture_downscale = false

That restores the byte-exact previous behaviour for WRF-comparison work,
and the run receipt records that it was declared.

The deep soil temperature analogue
==================================

``TSLB`` carries the same imprint, and for GFS it is worse than for ERA5:
the four GFS slabs coincide with Noah's four layers, so the layer-form
mapping in :func:`woof.ingest.soil.preprocess_noah_soil` copies them
straight through and the target grid's own deep-soil climatology (``TMN``,
geogrid ``SOILTEMP`` adjusted to the model terrain) never enters the column
at all.  WRF's own ERA5-style path does not have that hole: ``init_soil_2_real``
(``module_soil_pre.F``:1591-1608) brackets the profile with ``TSK`` at 0 m and
``TMN`` at 3 m, so every layer is anchored on the target's deep temperature in
proportion to its depth.

:func:`downscale_deep_soil_temperature` applies exactly that anchoring, and
only to the part of ``TMN`` the source mesh cannot represent::

    TSLB_k += (midpoint_k / 3 m) * (TMN - cellmean(TMN))

The weight is WRF's own linear-in-depth blend toward the 3 m boundary
condition.  Subtracting the source-cell mean means the source keeps every
scale it actually resolves and contributes nothing at the scales it does
not, so the source-cell mean of ``TSLB`` is unchanged, exactly.  Layer 1 is
weighted 0.017 and layer 4 is weighted 0.5, so this is a deep-layer
correction by construction.

Resolution advisory
===================

A domain whose grid spacing is much finer than the forcing mesh is asking
the source for detail it does not have.  :func:`source_mesh_receipt` records
the source spacing on every run and warns once when ``dx`` is finer than
about a fifth of it -- the regime where the imprint is large enough to see.
