"""Common CUDA/parallel-CPU contract for native preprocessing.

The forecast model itself remains CUDA-only.  This module selects the
backend used by the source-grid and WRF-real setup transforms that precede
the model allocation.  Both implementations consume and emit FP32 arrays;
the CPU implementation delegates interpolation arithmetic to the packaged
Rust bridge and uses deterministic NumPy elementwise helpers for the small
vector and humidity transforms.

The masked surface fields (soil moisture and temperature, snow, skin
temperature, sea ice) take WPS metgrid's masked chain in float64 in the
same Rust library under BOTH backends, parallel across target cells: the
CPU backend on its own library and CPU/memory worker budget, the CUDA
backend on the library the resolution
ladder picks and its host workers, every CPU the process may use when
none were given (:meth:`CudaPreprocessBackend.wps_masked_chain_engine`).  Each receipt
names that library as ``masked_surface_chain``.

    stages bounded CUDA batches when the whole build exceeds a 1 GiB pool.
    This leaves the card available for a concurrent forecast. Its receipt
    reserves the batch peak so a forecast can start beside later forcing hours.
    The bounded batches retain the whole array envelope in host RAM. A host
    that cannot hold that envelope keeps the full-device preparation when
    the whole build fits the card's free memory (2.8.4 ran every such
    preparation there, and it retains nothing on the host), recorded in
    ``host_fit`` with ``fits: False`` and the route taken. The host refusal
    stands where neither the host nor the card holds the build, and where a
    bounded backend was already admitted on a decoded price, because a
    chained forecast may have reserved only that backend's batch.
    A CPU backend passes untouched. A CUDA backend chosen by
    ``auto`` that does not fit the card's free memory becomes the CPU
    backend, with one line and the reason in its receipt; a CUDA backend
    the caller named is refused with :class:`PreparationDeviceRefused`,

    records ``device_fit``, so a CUDA preparation says why it was admitted.
    A card whose free memory cannot be read keeps the choice, recorded
    with ``fits: None``: an unread card never refuses.

    ``probe`` is a reading taken at this decision (the one
    :func:`resolve_preprocess_backend` just took, or a test's stand-in
    card); otherwise one subprocess probe is taken now, and this process
    never stands up a context to take it.  The reading ``auto`` recorded
    when the backend was resolved is NOT reused here: GFS and ERA5 resolve
    before their host decode and decide after it, minutes later, and a
    card other work shares (a chained preparation beside a forecast) can
    fill in between, so that reading kept CUDA on a card that no longer
    held the preparation.
