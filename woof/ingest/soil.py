    An ERA5 swvl value a hair below zero (GRIB packing, horizontal
    interpolation undershoot) is put on the range by
    :func:`clamp_soil_moisture_overshoot` and so becomes EXACTLY 0.0.  Noah's thermal conductivity then divides by
    SMC three times (kernels/noah.cu TDFCND: ``xunfroz = sh2o/smc`` 0/0,
    the ``ake`` divide, and ``powf(smcmax/smc, bexp)``), so ONE such land
    cell is NaN conductivity -> NaN ground heat flux -> NaN HFX and the
    run dies at step 0 blamed on the PBL scheme.  The threshold is a hard
    zero: 1e-12 survives the arithmetic, 0.0 does not -- but both are
    sub-physical, so both are floored.

    DIVERGENCE from WRF, deliberate (no-inherited-bugs framework):

    * **What WRF does** (v4.6.1 ``dyn_em/module_initialize_real.F``,
      ``account_for_zero_soil_moisture`` :3363, ``CASE (LSMSCHEME,
      NOAHMPSCHEME)`` :3365, layer-form arm :3367-3395): a land cell
      (``landmask>0.5``, ``170<TSLB(1)<400``) whose TOP layer has
      ``SMOIS(1) < 0.005`` gets its WHOLE column reset to the constant
      0.005 m3/m3, with a per-cell print and a total count.  The
      per-soil-type residual adjustment beside it (:3401, ``lqmi``) is
      commented out, so stock real.exe's floor is soil-type-blind.
    * **What woof does**: floors each layer of each land cell below the
      soil category's SMCDRY (air-dry; ``SOILPARM.TBL`` DRYSMC, consumed
      as ``SMCDRY = DRYSMC(SOILTYP)`` in ``module_sf_noahlsm.F:2453``)
      to that SMCDRY, and records the per-level counts and pre-floor
      minima as a receipt on the returned state.
    * **Why**: WRF's 0.005 sits BELOW every land category's SMCDRY (sand
      is 0.010), inside the range where Noah's own direct evaporation
      ``SRATIO = (SMC-SMCDRY)/(SMCMAX-SMCDRY)``
      (``module_sf_noahlsm.F:1214``) goes negative, and WRF's trigger
      reads only the top layer, so a dry deep layer under a wet top
      layer passes stock real.exe unrepaired and still reaches TDFCND's
      divides.  SMCDRY is the smallest soil moisture Noah's physics
      treats as physical, and flooring there is what WRF's own
      preprocessing effectively achieves for the fatal exact-zero case.

    WRF's ``170<TSLB<400`` precondition is already guaranteed here: the
    caller refused any soil temperature outside 170..400 K before this
    function runs.  Cells whose category has no positive SMCDRY (the
    SOILPARM WATER row) or is outside the table are left untouched, so
    ``sh2o_init``'s own category refusal fires exactly as before.

    ``pre_clip`` is the moisture BEFORE the 0..1 clip, so the receipt's
    minima report what the source actually delivered (-1e-9, not the
    0.0 the clip made of it).  Returns ``(soil_m, receipt)``; when no
    cell needs flooring the input array is returned UNTOUCHED (same
    object, byte-identical) with an empty receipt.

    This is ``module_soil_pre.F:init_soil_2_real`` with layer input:
    temperature is linearly interpolated through TSK at 0 m and the deep
    temperature at 3 m; moisture repeats its shallow/deep layer at 0/3 m.
    ``soil_type`` is WRF ISLTYP and drives the subsequent Noah LSMINIT
    frozen-water partition of SMOIS into SH2O.
    Open-water columns are filled with SST (or valid SKINTEMP fallback) and
    unit moisture exactly like the Fortran.  SEAICE/XICE is optional: values
    at or above Noah's 0.5 threshold are made land-like in XLAND so Noah's
    sea-ice branch is reachable.  WRF's LSMSCHEME sea-ice postprocessing is
    mirrored at init: binary XICE, TMN=271.4 K, a four-level 3 m ice-column
    TSLB profile, and SH2O=0.  Snow reconciliation is independent of surface
    type, as in ``module_initialize_real.F``.  Absence is exactly the
    historical all-zero XICE path.

    ``lake_mask`` and ``lake_skin_temperature`` are an all-or-none setup
    override for raw GEOG lakes.  Such cells are water even when coarse ERA5
    LANDSEA calls them land, and their SKINTEMP is the separately selected
    nearest finite source-water value.  Non-lake source land/ocean behavior
    remains byte-identical.

    ``landmask`` selects the terrestrial/water decision surface.  WRF's
    ``process_soil_real`` drives every land/water branch with the geogrid
    ``grid%landmask``, never the met-source LANDSEA; passing the static-build
    LANDMASK here reproduces that and keeps the soil classification
    consistent with the physics driver's mask.  ``None`` retains the
    historical met-source LANDSEA decision for adapters that have not yet
    declared their static mask.

    ``water_temperature`` is the finished water-surface field the calling
    route assembled with
    :func:`woof.ingest.water_temperature.assemble_for_route`, one provider
    per connected body of water.  It is not optional in the ordinary sense:
    a mapping that carries a raw ``SST`` beside its ``SKINTEMP`` and no
    assembled field is REFUSED here by ``route`` name, because the per-cell
    selector this replaced is what painted lakes as a quilt of two
    differently-mapped providers.  ``water_temperature_policy =
    "wrf_compat"`` is the one declaration that reopens that selector, for
    stock-WRF certification.  See
    :func:`woof.ingest.water_temperature.require_assembled_water_temperature`
    for why a mapping WITHOUT an SST is the identity and passes.

    ``terrain`` and ``source_orography`` (all-or-none) enable WRF's
    ``adjust_soil_temp_new`` elevation lapse: land skin and soil temperature
    inputs are shifted by ``-0.0065 * (terrain - source_orography)`` before
    the vertical mapping, exactly as ``process_soil_real`` adjusts TSK and
    ``st_input`` when the met source declares its own orography.  The 3 m
    deep temperature is NOT adjusted here: WRF's Noah branch subtracts
    ``0.0065 * terrain`` from the sea-level annual mean instead, which the
    static build already bakes into TMN.

    ``soil_mesh`` is the route's
    :class:`woof.ingest.soil_downscale.SoilMeshPlan`: the forcing mesh
    measured against this grid.  Supplied, the LAND soil state is
    reconstituted below the source spacing -- moisture through Noah's own
    ``SRATIO`` against the target grid's 30 arc-second soil texture, deep
    temperature through WRF's own linear-in-depth ``TMN`` anchoring -- and
    the receipt rides back on ``NoahSoilState.soil_texture_downscale``.
    This is the moisture and deep-temperature analogue of the elevation
    lapse above: both exist because the target grid knows things about the
    land surface that a 0.25 degree forcing mesh cannot.  See
    :mod:`woof.ingest.soil_downscale` for what stock WRF does instead and
    why this diverges from it deliberately.

    ``None`` means the route declared no source mesh, which is announced
    rather than silently skipped: without it the source mesh stays visible
    in SMOIS for the whole forecast and in every field soil moisture drives.
    ``SoilMeshPlan(..., enabled=False)`` -- ``[ingest]
    soil_texture_downscale = false`` -- is the deliberate WRF-comparison
    path and is byte-identical to the historical behaviour.
