"""Quantization-aware admission of bounded physical source fields.

The Python half of the argument the GRIB bridges make in Rust (see
``tools/grib1_bridge/src/quantization.rs``).  A quantity that is
physically AT a limit -- saturated soil, a solid-land fraction, an
ice-free ocean cell -- is stored at that limit and comes back a hair
outside it, because every stage between the encoder and here rounds:
GRIB2's ``(R + X * 2^E) * 10^-D`` reconstruction onto a fixed grid,
float32 storage of an f64 decode, unit conversions in a declarative
mapping.  A field user's preparation died on
``GFS_SM010040 value 1.0000000019073487 outside [0,1]`` for exactly that
reason, and the identical refusal was reproduced on the HRRR and mapped
routes.

The bridges can derive their tolerance from the record's own packing
parameters.  Nothing here can: by this point the packing is gone and
only an array remains.  So the tolerance is the round-off the pipeline
demonstrably carries -- a few float32 ulps of the bound's own magnitude
-- which is orders of magnitude below any physically meaningful
difference in a fraction, and orders of magnitude above the excursions
that were being refused.

This never widens a gate.  It moves values that are already at a bound
back ONTO it, counts them, and leaves everything else for the caller's
existing refusal, which is unchanged.  ERA5's soil preflight
(:mod:`woof.ingest.preflight`) reached the same conclusion first, from
observed data, and states its own explicit window; this is the general
form of that judgement.
