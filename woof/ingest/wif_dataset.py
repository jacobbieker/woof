"""The mp=28 WIF climatology dataset: pin, acquisition route, resolver.

``woof/ingest/wif_climatology.py`` READS the dataset; this module says
WHICH bytes are admissible, WHERE they come from, and refuses -- by name,
with the command that fixes it -- when they are not there.

It is deliberately the same shape as
:mod:`woof.core.thompson_aerosol_contract`'s ``CCN_ACTIVATE.BIN``
handling, because the problem is the same one: a fixed external file that
never changes, that no code path can regenerate, and whose substitution
would be a different numerical setup rather than an error.  The four parts
of that pattern are reproduced here on purpose --

1. a pinned exact size and SHA-256 (:data:`WIF_DATASET_ASSET`);
2. a documented acquisition route quoted verbatim in the refusal
   (:data:`WIF_DATASET_SOURCE`);
3. an override precedence -- explicit path, then the file environment
   override, then the directory override, then the staged user root --
   in which an override that names a missing file is an ERROR and never
   a silent fall-through to some other copy;
4. a fail-closed resolver (:func:`resolve_wif_climatology_path`) whose
   message names what is missing, what it is, where to get it, and how to
   supply it.

WHERE IT DIFFERS, and why: ``CCN_ACTIVATE.BIN`` is 35,288 bytes and woof
redistributes it inside the wheel.  This file is 225,443,520 bytes -- over
twice PyPI's 100 MB per-file cap and over GitHub's 100 MiB blob limit --
so :data:`WIF_DATASET_REDISTRIBUTED` is False and stays False.  That is
exactly the situation ``woof/table_assets.py`` already exists for
(``freezeH2O.dat``, 243 MiB, and ``qr_acr_qg_V4.dat``, 71 MiB), so this
dataset joins THAT command rather than growing a second downloader:
``woof fetch-tables --wif`` stages it under the identical
verify-then-atomically-install contract.

WHY A MISSING FILE IS FATAL rather than defaulted.  Unlike
``CCN_ACTIVATE.BIN`` there is no prefill to be silently wrong with: the
WIF ingest is selected by ``aer_init_opt=1`` WITH ``wif_input_opt=1``, and
the alternative -- thompson_init's synthetic nwfa/nifa profile -- is a
DIFFERENT and perfectly valid configuration that ``aer_init_opt=0``
already selects.  Quietly demoting to it would mean a run whose receipt
says "monthly climatology" while its aerosol came from an exponential
profile in ``module_mp_thompson.F:493-546``.  That is the concrete
breakage this refusal prevents.
