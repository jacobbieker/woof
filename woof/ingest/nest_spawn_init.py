"""Materialize a spawn-triggered nest: own-grid statics, parent atmosphere.

The spawn half of the storm-following program's birth event.  A dormant
nest (:mod:`woof.core.nest_spawn`) fires mid-run; THIS module builds the
child that fires into existence, out of exactly two ingredients:

1. OWN-GRID STATICS for the trigger-chosen footprint, through the same
   footprint-parametric static path every declared child uses
   (:func:`woof.static.build.build_static_for_domain` on the child grid
   nested at the fired placement, with the ``[static.highres]`` overlay
   when the case enables it -- the tile cache is what makes a
   trigger-time build fast); and
2. THE CURRENT PARENT STATE for the atmosphere, through the existing
   nest cold-start machinery: :func:`woof.ingest.nest_init
   .parent_only_init`'s full-parent SINT fill, followed by the SAME
   terrain-adjustment sequence the real-data child path runs at t = 0 --
   ``blend_terrain`` on the ht/mub/phb operand triple, ``adjust_tempqv``
   for the base-column-mass change, the ``start_domain`` base/EOS
   re-derivation, and the real-nest ``press_adj`` MU correction
   (``_adjust_and_rederive``) -- invoked mid-run.

WHY THE PARENT AND NOT THE ANALYSIS.  The delayed-start path
(:func:`woof.core.model.execute_experiment`'s ``on_domain_start``)
initializes a late child from the EXTERNAL analysis at its activation
time.  A spawn trigger fires precisely because the parent has developed
a storm the analysis does not contain -- initializing from the analysis
would materialize a nest without the storm it exists to follow.  So the
atmosphere is the live parent's, and the only external input is the
static ground.

THE TERRAIN ADOPTION, MAPPED ONTO THE REAL PATH.  On the real-data path
the child's fine-frame base state comes from the analytic hydrostatic
base on its own terrain (``module_initialize_real``'s construction;
:func:`woof.ingest.real._make_real_base`) and its atmosphere from the
analysis; the parent contributes only the SINT-captured ht/mub/phb
blend operands.  Here the roles map exactly: the parent-frame child
(the ``parent_only_init`` product) IS the pre-adjustment state whose
``save_mub`` frame the atmosphere was built in, the parent-frame
ht/mub/phb ARE the SINT captures (they were produced by the same
operator), and the fine-frame operands come from ``_make_real_base`` on
the own-grid ``HGT_M``.  The blend then takes the parent near the
boundary and the fine terrain in the interior, and ``adjust_tempqv`` /
``press_adj`` correct theta/qv/MU for the column-mass change --
byte-for-byte the sequence :func:`woof.ingest.nest_init
.finalize_prepared_child` runs, with the analysis replaced by the
parent.  The calibration point: with fine terrain identical to the
parent-frame terrain (a flat case) every operand of the adoption is the
identity, so the adopted child is BITWISE the plain ``parent_only_init``
child -- pinned by tests/test_nest_spawn_init.py.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO.  It decides nothing (the trigger did) and
attaches nothing to the live tree: node construction, clocks, coupler
and physics-driver attachment are the runner's, through the same
``on_child_built`` seam :func:`woof.core.nest_relocation.relocate_child`
publishes, and the schedule surgery is
:func:`woof.experiment.active_experiment` at a leg boundary.  Land
DRIVER state (Noah/NoahMP continuation) follows the same rule it does at
every leg boundary and relocation: re-initialised by ``on_child_built``,
never invented here.

A restart across a spawn resumes, and this module is on that path too:
:func:`woof.runtime.restore_nest_lifecycle` re-materializes every live
episode through the same entry point a leg boundary uses, at the
placement the slot fired on.  What the spawn still does is move the tree
restart fingerprint by construction -- the activated placement differs
from the declared one -- so a checkpoint written after a spawn is refused
by a FRESH build and resumes only into the run that wrote it.  Nothing
here relaxes that.

    """Interpolate the live parent's land-surface state onto the newborn.

    THE ESTABLISHED PRACTICE, and the one WRF has no alternative to here.
    A nest that starts later than its parent has two supported routes
    (Users' Guide chapter 5, "Nesting"):

    * ``fine_input_stream = 2`` -- 3-D meteorology interpolated from the
      parent, but static AND MASKED SURFACE fields (soil temperature and
      moisture among them) read from the nest's own ``wrfinput``.  That
      file is a ``real.exe`` product at the nest's own footprint and start
      time, so it presupposes knowing both in advance; and
    * ``input_from_file = .false.`` -- "the model interpolates all
      variables required in the nest from the coarse domain fields",
      which is what ``med_nest_initial``'s unconditional
      ``med_interp_domain(parent, nest)`` does before any input file is
      consulted (share/mediation_integrate.F:670, :758-766).

    A trigger-spawned nest picks its footprint mid-run, from a storm the
    analysis does not contain, so the first route cannot exist for it:
    there is no ``real.exe`` product at a footprint nobody knew about.
    The second is therefore the route, and it is not a degradation of
    WRF practice but the same operator WRF runs at every nest birth and,
    via the identical ``med_interp_domain`` call after each
    ``shift_domain_em``, at every moving-nest leading edge
    (share/mediation_nest_move.F:186).  HAFS's storm-following nest
    states the rule in words: interpolation at the leading edge "taking
    into account the land/sea/ice mask to only consider values from the
    same surface type".

    WOOF keeps the half of ``fine_input_stream = 2`` it CAN have -- the
    own-grid statics (:func:`prepare_spawn_statics`) -- which is strictly
    more than ``input_from_file = .false.`` gives, and is exactly why the
    masked interpolator is essential rather than decorative: the child's
    land-use categories are its OWN, resolved at the child's dx, so they
    disagree with the parent's wherever finer terrain resolves a coast,
    lake or island the parent smoothed away.  Those disagreements are
    counted, per field family, never silent.

    ``names`` defaults to :data:`~woof.ingest.relocation_init
    .LAND_SURFACE_CONTINUATION_FIELDS`, the same inventory a relocation
    carries; a field the parent's configuration never allocated is skipped
    by name and named in the receipt, exactly as the transplant does.

    Returns ``{"fields": {name: host ndarray}, "receipt": {...}}``.
