"""Parallel Rust CPU fallback for native preprocessing transforms.

The shared library is built by ``tools/grib1_bridge`` alongside the native
GRIB decoders.  Every public operation consumes the same FP32 array
contract as the CUDA implementations.  Work is split only across
independent target points/columns, so worker count does not affect an
element's arithmetic.

There are two horizontal entry points, and the difference between them is
WHO OWNS THE DONOR.  ``gpuwm_regular_interp_f32`` takes a fractional
source coordinate and derives the donor itself, which is right for a
regular lat/lon source.  ``gpuwm_indexed_interp_f32`` takes the donor as
an exact integer pair plus its FP32 fraction, which is the only correct
shape for a projected source: that route selects its donor in FP64, and a
local coordinate just below an integer can advance its donor once it is
rounded to FP32.  The second entry may be absent from an older staged
library; :attr:`CpuPreprocessBackend.indexed_donor_interp` reports that,
and the projected caller keeps its NumPy path for exactly that case.

The masked surface fields (soil moisture and temperature, snow, skin
temperature, sea ice) take WPS metgrid's masked chain through
``gpuwm_wps_masked_chain_f64``, in float64 and byte-identical to the NumPy
transcription kept as its test oracle
(``woof/verify/wps_masked_oracle.py``).  Both preprocessing backends call
it: there is no NumPy route for these fields at run time, so a library
that predates the entry is refused by name with the remedy
(:meth:`CpuPreprocessBackend.require_wps_masked_chain`).
