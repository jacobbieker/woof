"""Native HRRR window loading and Lambert-to-Lambert interpolation.

The on-disk format is produced by ``hrrr_grib2_bridge``.  The loader binds
the editable gate and every payload to an externally recorded SHA-256 of the
``SHA256SUMS`` manifest before exposing arrays.  Horizontal interpolation is
performed in HRRR projection coordinates.  Wind vectors are explicitly
rotated from the source grid basis to earth-relative, interpolated, and then
rotated into the target Lambert basis.

    A solid-land cell is stored at a land fraction of exactly 1.0 and

    HRRR twin of the GFS field report -- ``1.0000000019`` was reproduced
    on both -- so the two unit fractions are now clamped within the
    round-off this pipeline carries and refuse beyond it.  The
    temperature and humidity ranges below are plausibility windows no
    real value approaches, and are untouched.

    SOILT keeps its 170..400 K band on source OPEN WATER (LANDSEA and
    XICE both below 0.5) and is admitted outside it on source LAND, the
    cells the soil initializer rebuilds TSK-to-TMN as real.exe does
    (:func:`woof.ingest.soil.unreasonable_land_soil_columns`), which is
    the split :func:`_record_soil_field_stats` makes on the target.
    Refusing the band on land refused every HRRRv2 cycle over western
    snowpack, whose analyses carry land soil temperatures of 60 to 168 K.
    An ICE-covered water cell is admitted too: HRRR runs its land-ice
    column there, and on 2017-01-19 00Z a one-cell frozen lake at
    46.2N 113.3W carries the same 158 K snowpack column as the land
    around it.  Neither is a donor for a target land column, and target water
    starts from its skin temperature, so no such value reaches the model.
    An IN-band SOILT is admitted here as it always was; the soil
    initializer rebuilds the same way a snow-covered target land column
    whose top soil sits further below its skin than a snowpack allows
    (:func:`woof.ingest.soil.snow_soil_below_skin_columns`), which is
    what the rest of those HRRRv2 snowpack columns carry (tops near 200 K
    under a 268 K skin).

    This is admission, not repair: a snapshot's field mapping is a
    read-only proxy, so the clamped copies decide the verdict here and
    the arrays are clamped again where they are consumed (the soil seam,
    and the mapped-output check below).  Clamping at the point of use is
    the accurate place for it -- nothing downstream inherits a value this
    function silently rewrote.

    land donor is consulted to produce it.  The four specified-boundary
    strips are mapped independently, so a Pacific-coast domain's
    all-water west strip used to abort a preparation whose other three
    strips and whose interior were entirely ordinary -- and the message
    named neither the strip nor the domain.

    The land-window statistics below are exactly that: a comparison of
