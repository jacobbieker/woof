The public surface is deliberately setup-only: :func:`build_input_catalog`
hashes and decodes resolved inputs into immutable metadata, while
:func:`preflight_report` runs every independent check and returns *all*

    which takes a source pressure column strictly monotonic in EITHER

    one that is not strictly monotonic at all, which it names with
    ``source pressure must be strictly monotonic in every column``.  The
    check door reads its ladder from the catalog this function fills, so
    the two doors admit the same inventories.

    This is not a hypothetical ordering.  ERA5 publishes
    ``pressure_level`` descending, 1000 hPa first, and a keyless ARCO
    window of it was refused by ``woof check`` before its memory section
    while ``woof run`` initialized and ran the same file end to end.
    Two further verdicts depended on the same normalization: read in file
    order, a descending ladder makes ``levels[0]`` the DEEPEST level and
    ``levels[-1]`` the highest, which turns the p_top coverage test and
    the 1000 hPa terrain-column test into their own opposites.
