"""The device price of a CUDA preparation, known before its first allocation.

A CUDA preparation builds, for each forcing time, a horizontally
interpolated analysis, the vertical-interpolation plans and outputs, and
then one complete :class:`woof.core.state.DomainState`.  Nothing asked
whether that fitted the card before allocating it, so a 1792x1024x55 GFS
preparation on a 24 GB card decoded its inputs, built its statics and then
stopped about two minutes later with a raw CuPy out-of-memory inside
``DomainState.__init__``.  This module prices that preparation from the
same inventories the allocations are made from, per route, so every door
can decide before the first device allocation: ``auto`` prepares on the
CPU when the price does not fit the card's free memory, and an explicit
``cuda`` request is refused by name.

No GPU imports: the price is arithmetic over shapes.

THE TERMS, per domain being built (bytes, float32):

* ``model_state``: the exact
  :func:`woof.core.device_inventory.state_array_shapes` inventory
  (83 arrays at mp=8 with terrain).
* ``forcing_analysis``: the horizontally interpolated source fields on the
  target grid, ``level_fields x source_levels`` level planes plus the
  single-level planes, from the decoded inventory where the door has it.
* ``vertical_setup``: the mass and U/V vertical plans,
  ``(source_levels + nz) x (C + U + V)``, and the vertical outputs,
  ``nz x (mass_outputs x C + U + V)``, with ``mass_outputs`` the source's
  mass-point level fields (temperature, humidity, pressure and every
  hydrometeor the source carries), never fewer than three.
* ``real_columns``: source doubles, column thermodynamics and staggered
  pressure workspaces for the specific-humidity device dispatch. Allocation
  hooks measured 12,371,798,528 bytes live and 13,114,399,232 reserved on
  sm_120 at 800 x 600 x 50; this term conservatively covers that peak.
* ``setup_residual``: :data:`SETUP_RESIDUAL` minus one, times the analysis
  and vertical setup, for the temporaries the itemization does not name.
* ``pool_headroom``: :data:`PREPARATION_POOL_HEADROOM` minus one, times
  everything live: what the CuPy pool reserves beyond what is referenced.
* ``cuda_context``: the card's CUDA context, outside the pool.
* ``boundary_tables``: the root's float32 lateral-boundary tables, on the
  routes that attach them on the card before the children are built.
* ``worker_slots``: native HRRR's spawned boundary workers, each with its
  own context and one side strip being built.
* ``source_transform``: the FP64 humidity conversion ERA5 runs on the whole
  SOURCE grid, which no target-shaped term can see.

The ROUTE decides which of those coexist (:data:`PREPARATION_ROUTES`, a
table: a new route is a row, not a code path).  The price is the largest
phase plus the context.

CALIBRATION (:data:`MEASURED_PREPARATION_PEAKS`): four CUDA preparations on
an otherwise empty H100 80 GB, HRRR pressure-level input, 7 forcing times,
pool high-water read after every allocation.  Live non-state memory at the
peak was 1.005 to 1.006 times the itemized analysis and vertical setup on
all three builds (1792x1024x55, 896x512x59 and the 480x480x59 child), and
the pool reserved 1.10 to 1.18 times what was live.  The price carries
1.10 on the first and 1.20 on the second.  THE MARGIN, and why: with the
Linux context the price sits 4.7% over the measured card peak on the
tightest case (the 3 km root, where the pool's 1.18 is closest to 1.20)
and 8% to 11% over the others (the nests carry every child's setup at
once, an upper bound for a child built one at a time).  The residual's
10% is kept for sources this run did not measure: the 24 GB failure (GFS,
22.92 GiB reserved with 1.95 GiB of the state still to allocate) held
1.17 times its itemization reserved, inside 1.10 x 1.20, and is priced at
30.2 GiB.  Tests hold the price at or above every measured peak and
within a quarter of it.

THE OTHER ROUTES (:data:`MEASURED_ROUTE_PEAKS`): the routes whose terms
the mapped runs never exercised were each run once on a 16 GB card at a
reference shape, and tests hold each route's price at or above its own
peak.
