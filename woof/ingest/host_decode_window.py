"""How many forcing leads a host-side decode holds at once, from HOST RAM.

A preparation decodes its forcing on the host whatever backend builds the
states afterwards, so the decode is budgeted against the RAM this process
can still take -- ``MemAvailable`` under every cgroup limit it runs in
(:func:`woof.ingest.preparation_workers.host_available_bytes`) -- never
against the card.

Named breakage (the gate law): the 2026-10-04T12 and 2026-10-05T00 runs of
a 240 h, 81-lead GFS 0.25-degree template were SIGKILLed in their prepare
stage on a 64 GiB host beside a 96 GB card.  Their leads were whole-globe
``pgrb2.0p25`` objects (about 540 MB each); all 81 were ready at once, so
one bridge run parsed every one of them into memory (about 44 GB) and the
preparation then held all 81 decoded leads as float64 (about 1.1 GB
each), while the planner had priced the run against the card's 93.93 GiB.

The price of a lead batch, with ``n`` leads decoded on ``t`` threads:

* every lead's GRIB object, parsed and held for the whole bridge run
  (``n x lead_bytes``);
* per thread, one object being read beside its parse and one lead's
  decoded float32 arrays being written (``t x (lead_bytes + decoded)``);
* the preparation's own working copies of decoded leads -- the cached
  float64 snapshots and the transient of loading one -- which this module
  reserves as :data:`PREPARATION_RESIDENT_LEADS` float64 leads.

The whole is held to :data:`DECODE_HOST_SHARE` of the RAM available when
the batch starts.  The share is not all of it because the forecast stage
of a chained run starts beside the preparation and takes host RAM of its
own after the batch was sized, and because the fetch running beside an
as-posted preparation keeps writing.
