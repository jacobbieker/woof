"""Hash-bound, atomically published prepared real-data state caches.

The normal real-data path constructs a full 3-D state for every forcing
time even though specified lateral forcing retains only narrow boundary
strips.  A repeated benchmark therefore used to repay the complete vertical
interpolation for every forcing hour before its first model step.

This module persists the integration-ready products of that work:

* the exact time-zero prognostic/diagnostic state;
* the original FP64 vertical coordinate and base state used to load it;
* only the horizontally mapped surface fields needed to initialize physics;
* every immutable host lateral-boundary value/tendency table.

The cache is rebuildable input, not a model restart.  It is nevertheless
fail-closed: callers supply a canonical identity binding the source manifest,
static cache, configuration, namelist, and code revision.  Every array has a
shape/dtype/content digest, the complete manifest has its own digest, and a
temporary directory is renamed into place only after the header is complete.
No pickle or object arrays are accepted.

#: Identity fields added to the prepared-domain document AFTER caches
#: carrying the older shape were already in the field, mapped to the
#: value that means "this feature is not in use".
#:
#: v1.1.0 gave every domain an optional per-domain ``start_time`` for
#: staggered nest starts.  The prepared-cache identity is compared by
#: strict equality, and a v1.0.1 header was serialized before the field
#: existed, so after upgrading the wheel EVERY prepared tree in the
#: field became unrunnable -- refused with "d01 cache domain config
#: differs from experiment", a sentence that points at the user's
#: experiment TOML when the cause was a package upgrade.  A a development machine
#: validation run diffed the two documents: exactly one added key, and
#: zero value differences among the eleven shared keys and ~110 run
#: fields.
#:
#: Tolerating that is not weakening identity, and the narrowness is what
#: makes it true.  A field ABSENT from the header and holding its
#: documented default in the live configuration describes the same
#: prepared state as a header written before the field existed: the
#: feature is off in both.  A field absent from the header and holding a
#: NON-default value describes a different setup and is still refused,
#: as is any field the header carries and the live configuration
#: contradicts.  Entries are added here deliberately, one per field, by
#: whoever adds the field -- never by a rule that tolerates absence in
#: general.  That instruction was missed four times in a row
#: (``run.mp28_aerosol_source``, ``run.wif_climatology_path``,
#: ``run.p3_backend``, ``run.ntiedtke_tiedtke_closure``), each time
#: refusing every prepared tree written before the field, so the duty
#: no longer rests on the instruction: tests/test_prepared_cache.py pins
#: today's ``RunConfig`` against the field set at the identity header's
#: introduction and fails on any field that is in neither this table nor
#: :data:`STRICT_IDENTITY_FIELDS`.
#: v1.8 adds the per-domain ``spawn`` declaration (dormant
#: spawn-triggered nests, woof/core/nest_spawn.py).  Its not-in-use
#: value is ``None`` -- an ordinary live domain -- which is exactly the
#: state every header written before the field existed describes.  A
#: domain that really is dormant holds a SpawnConfig document instead,
#: and is refused against an older header, as it must be: the cache was
#: prepared for a nest that is not the dormant one.
#:
#: Five more fields joined ``DomainConfig`` after spawn WITHOUT joining
#: this table when they landed -- ``tiles`` (df5cf42d0), ``output``
#: (8d8855a8c), and the lifecycle trio ``retire``/``rearm``/``follow``
#: (8e663a751/21254c056) -- which re-opened the V-12 hole for every
#: tree prepared before them: an upgrade refused the tree and blamed
#: the experiment file.  Each declares an optional feature whose
#: not-in-use value is ``None``, the exact state every pre-field header
#: describes, on the same grounds as ``spawn``: none of them changes
#: the prepared initial state or the boundary tables -- ``tiles`` and
#: ``output`` say how the run writes, the lifecycle trio says what a
#: nest does after birth.  A domain that really uses one holds a
#: document instead of ``None`` and is refused against an older header.
#: ``run.ntiedtke_tiedtke_closure`` (cu_physics = 16) is the first
#: NESTED member of this table.  The walk below builds dotted paths,
#: so a ``run.`` entry has always worked here -- this is the first to
#: use it.  Its not-in-use value is ``False``, which selects New
#: Tiedtke's OWN closure: exactly what every cache prepared before
#: the flag existed was prepared with, so "absent" and "default"
#: describe the same prepared state provably rather than plausibly.

#: Identity fields that describe when the run WRITES, not what it
#: integrates.  woof already publishes this partition twice, for the two
#: other places the same question is asked:
#: :data:`woof.io.restart.CONFIG_RUN_LENGTH_FIELDS` (which RunConfig
#: fields may differ between a checkpoint's writer and its resumer) and
#: :func:`woof.core.model.experiment_fingerprint` (which fields are
#: excluded from the trajectory hash).  A prepared cache is the same
#: question one stage earlier -- it holds an initial state and its
#: boundaries, and preparation writes no history or restart frame at all
#: -- so it asks the same table instead of keeping a third opinion.
#:
#: Binding these here is what refused a two-domain HRRR tree whose d02
#: history cadence was 900 s beside d01's 3600 s, and a hierarchy whose
#: namelist carried ``restart_interval = 60``: both are output cadences,
#: neither changes one model step.
#:
#: ``run.run_seconds`` belongs to the same partition and was missing
#: from it: a prepared cache is an initial state plus the boundary
#: tables for the times it decoded, and the forecast LENGTH changes
#: neither.  Its omission is what made "extend a run from its
#: checkpoint" -- the worked example in FIRST-LIGHT section 7 -- refuse
#: on the prepared routes: the length moved this identity, so the cache
#: had to be re-prepared to run one hour longer.  Whether the prepared
#: forcing actually REACHES the requested length is a separate gate and
#: is unchanged; both prepared runners already refuse a run past their
#: prepared coverage (``prepared_single_domain_forecast`` at its
#: cadence/coverage check, ``prepared_domain_tree_forecast`` at
#: "experiment duration exceeds prepared forcing hours"), so tolerating
#: the field here widens nothing.
#: The DOMAIN-level ``history_interval_s`` is the same knob as
#: ``run.output_interval_s`` under its other spelling, and this document
#: carries both.  Dropping only the ``run.`` one left the cadence bound
#: after all: a tree restarted with a changed history cadence -- one of
#: the three changes ``--restart`` publishes as permitted -- was refused
#: naming a field that says nothing about the prepared state.
