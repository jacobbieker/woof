#: 9 belongs for the same reason 16 does: Milbrandt-Yau PREDICTS the

#: mass, and no snow and no graupel anywhere in the package, because P3
#: predicts rime mass and rime volume in place of a snow/graupel/hail
#: split.  QICE is therefore added through this tuple rather than through
#: ``ICE_MASS_WRFINPUT``: putting 50 in the ice-mass branch would demand a
#: QSNOW and a QGRAUP that a P3 wrfinput never contains and that a P3
#: ``DomainState`` has no field to receive (woof/core/state.py:464-478).
#: All four scalars are transported prognostics, and every one carries the
#: wrfinput stream in its Registry IO string -- ``i0rhusdf=(bdy_interp:dt)``
#: on QNICE (Registry.EM_COMMON:523), QNRAIN (:533), QIR (:555) and QIB
#: (:557) -- so real.exe writes all four exactly as it writes Morrison's
#: QNRAIN.  None of them is diagnosed, so unlike Morrison there is no
#: optional member here, and a missing one does not raise inside P3, it
#: silently rewrites the analysis:
#:   * a zero QNICE beside a real QICE is clamped to ``nsmall`` = 1.e-16
#:     (module_mp_p3.F:231, :2573) and the mean-mass ice diameter built
#:     from it (:2578) then indexes the lookup table (:2582) in its
#:     largest-particle bin for the whole column;
#:   * a zero QIR/QIB sends ``calc_bulkRhoRime`` (:6784, called at :2580)
#:     down its ``bi_rim < 1.e-15`` branch, which hard-zeros both and
#:     returns rho_rime = 0 (:6812-6814), declaring every ice particle in
#:     the restored state unrimed -- P3's one distinguishing prognostic,
#:     silently set to nothing.
#: Both are finite, bounded and wrong: the mp=28 terminal-clamp hazard in
#: the note above, in P3's own numbers.
#: mp_physics=9 (Milbrandt-Yau double-moment, seven class).
#: ``Registry.EM_COMMON`` declares the package as
#: ``moist:qv,qc,qr,qi,qs,qg,qh;scalar:qnc,qnr,qni,qns,qng,qnh`` -- WSM6's
#: six masses plus HAIL, and a number moment for every one of the six
#: hydrometeors.  All six numbers are prognostic and none is diagnosed, so
#: all six are REQUIRED, QNCLOUD included: WRF's own driver binds
#: qnc/qnr/qni/qns/qng/qnh INOUT to ``mp_milbrandt2mom_driver``
#: (module_microphysics_driver.F:1857-1862), which is the same argument
#: that puts 16 and 28 in REQUIRED_QNCLOUD_MICROPHYSICS above.  QHAIL is a
#: MASS, so it is listed here rather than folded into ICE_MASS_WRFINPUT,
#: which is shared with the six-species schemes that have no hail at all.

#: What nest relocation needs that a ``wrfinput`` handoff does not carry.

#: VERIFIED 2026-09-04 against woof/ingest/relocation_init.py,
#: woof/ingest/nest_init.py and woof/core/nest_relocation.py: none of
#: the three so much as mentions ``wrfinput`` or ``wrfbdy``.  A relocated
#: child's statics are rebuilt for the new footprint from the nest's own
#: static source at nest resolution and its atmosphere is filled from the
#: LIVE PARENT, so nothing on that path reopens an initial-condition file
#: after t=0 and the capability survives this entry point intact.
#:
#: It is not free, though, and the one condition is structural:
#: :func:`woof.ingest.relocation_init.real_relocation_initializer`
#: requires EXACTLY ONE statics source -- a geography ``catalog`` or a
#: sealed-corridor ``statics_builder`` -- and refuses with neither.  A
#: wrfinput handoff supplies neither, because real.exe's statics are baked
#: into the wrfinput at the ORIGINAL footprint and say nothing about
#: ground the nest has not stood on yet.  So a wrfinput-entry run that
#: wants a moving nest must additionally declare a geography root.
