"""The out-of-coverage refusal, as a class a front door can own.

A source grid that does not reach the requested domain is a complete,
well-named refusal: :func:`outside_source_grid_message` prints the first
uncovered target point, the source index it maps to, and the window the
source actually covers, which is what separates "the crop is too small"
from "this source does not reach the target" -- two problems with
opposite remedies.

It was raised as a bare ``ValueError`` from inside the interpolator, so
the preparation adapters, which call the interpolator with no handler,
relayed it as ten lines of internal call stack with the sentence at the
bottom.  A user read ``woof/ingest/horiz.py`` line numbers before
reading what to do about their domain.  Giving the refusal its own class
lets every preparation door catch exactly this and nothing else: a real
defect in the same call still raises and still prints its stack.

The class stays a ``ValueError`` subclass on purpose -- library callers
that already guard interpolation with ``except ValueError`` keep working
unchanged.

Nothing here is specific to a source.  Any regional model -- any grid
that simply does not extend to where the user put their domain -- lands
on the same class, the same message and the same remedy, so a model
added as table data inherits the behaviour with no new code.
