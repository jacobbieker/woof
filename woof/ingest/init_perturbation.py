"""Config-driven initial-state theta bubbles for real-data experiments.

The [perturbation] block (:mod:`woof.experiment`) declares warm bubbles
in geographic coordinates; this module evaluates them on one domain's
grid and writes them into that domain's initial theta (and, under
``rh_preserve``, qv) columns inside
:func:`woof.ingest.real.initialize_real`, before the specific volume
and geopotential are formed.  The shape is WRF's em_quarter_ss bubble
(module_initialize_ideal.F; the port's transcription is
woof/verify/cases/moist_bubble.py): peak ``amplitude_k`` at the
center, ``cos^2(pi/2 * r)`` taper on the normalized ellipse radius
``r = sqrt((d_h/radius)^2 + ((z - z_c)/depth)^2)``, exactly zero at and
beyond ``r = 1``.

PER-DOMAIN APPLICATION, deliberately.  woof's real-data nest init is
real.exe-per-domain, not ndown: every child re-ingests the source
analysis on its own grid (woof/ingest/nest_init.py), so a bubble
written into the parent's prepared state would be invisible to a
child's initial conditions.  Each domain that initializes at the
experiment start time therefore evaluates the same geographic bubble on
its own grid inside its own ``initialize_real`` -- the one init path
every domain shares -- and the per-domain receipts record what each
grid actually received.  A domain with a delayed start initializes from
the analysis at its activation time, by which point the parent has
already evolved the bubble, so it takes no fresh analytic bubble.

OFF is absolute: with no [perturbation] block
:func:`build_initial_state_perturbation` is never called, callers pass
``initial_perturbation=None``, and ``initialize_real`` executes not one
instruction of this module -- the prepared state is byte-identical to a
build without this file.

Refusals (loud, before any integration):

* a bubble center outside the coarse domain (``require_containment``);
* an enabled bubble whose center is inside the domain but which touches
  zero cells (radius below the grid's resolving power) -- a refusal,
  never a silent no-op, per the treatment-proof rule;
* a perturbed layer hotter than the top of the temperature table the
  domain's radiation reads (RTE+RRTMGP: 355 K), because RRTMGP refuses
  that layer at its first call and the forecast stops at step 1;
* ``rh_preserve`` building water vapour past
  :data:`RH_PRESERVE_QV_LIMIT_KG_KG`, the measured mixing ratio past which
  the forecast stops being finite (see the constant).

This is an ArWen-over-WRF extension (PROVENANCE.md): stock WRF v4.6.1
has no config-driven real-data initial-condition perturbation; its warm
bubbles exist only in the idealized initializers.
