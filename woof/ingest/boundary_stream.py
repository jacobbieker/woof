"""Chained preparation: the forecast starts while later boundaries are built.

Boundary interval k needs only forcing times k and k+1.  A preparation used
to build every forcing time, pack every interval and publish the whole
prepared tree in one rename before the model could take its first step.
This module splits the prepared tree into three parts so the model can
start once the start state and the next forcing time exist:

* the HEAD: everything the start time makes (static fields, receipts, the
  non-boundary arrays of ``prepared-cache/``) plus ``boundary-stream/
  head.json``, which carries the full interval schedule.  It is published
  with the route's own single rename, early;
* one SEGMENT per interval: its arrays written straight into
  ``prepared-cache/`` under the file numbers the one-shot writer would have
  given them, then ``boundary-stream/segments/{k:05d}.json`` written last.
  The marker is the only ready signal, so the rule works across processes
  and across machines (a copy loop copies arrays first, marker last);
* the SEAL: the same ``prepared-cache/header.json`` the one-shot writer
  writes (so ``content_sha256`` is unchanged), then the companion files,
  then ``proof.json`` last, which stays every existing consumer's
  completion marker.

A tree whose segments all exist before the run starts is the same source,
already complete: there is one writer (:class:`PreparedTreeWriter`), one
reader (:class:`StreamedIntervals`) and one wait, used by every route that
builds boundaries from forcing times.

The early publication is on by default (see :data:`CHAINED_DEFAULT`);
``WOOF_CHAINED_PREP=0`` turns it off for diagnosis, and then the same
writer publishes the head at the seal, so the run starts after preparation
exactly as before.  An installation with no forecast (the RW-WPS
preparation package, see :func:`forecast_installed`) always publishes at
the seal.

    in a spawned process); this thread waits until
    ``<prepared_root>/boundary-stream/head.json`` is written by THIS
    preparation or the preparation ends, then calls
    ``forecast(head_sha256)`` for a chained head, or ``forecast(None)``

    its seal and waits for it, so a retry reuses the complete preparation
    instead of building every forcing time again.  A stop asks the
    producer to stop (``stop.json``), waits for it to exit and re-raises:
    ``KeyboardInterrupt``, ``SystemExit``, and every exception
