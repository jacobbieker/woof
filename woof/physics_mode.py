"""The physics-fidelity axis and the divergence ledger it resolves.

WOOF ships one physics identity today: every selector is transcribed from
WRF v4.6.1 and pinned against it.  A *patch* is a place where WOOF would
deliberately do something else because the physics is believed to be better,
and the only accurate way to find out is to score both against observations.
This module is the machinery that lets one configuration file express both
sides of that question without a second file that can drift from the first.

THE AXIS
--------
``physics_mode`` is an ``[experiment]`` key with two values:

``"wrf-faithful"``
    Every registered ledger entry resolves to its WRF-faithful value.  This
    is the default and it is what the oracle apparatus governs.
``"arwen-patched"``
    Every *toggleable* entry of a registered patch-set version resolves to
    its patched value.  ``patchset`` names the version (``"v1"`` today);
    ``patches`` optionally restricts the resolution to a subset of that
    version's entries, which is how a single-patch ablation arm is spelled.

``arwen-patched`` NEVER means "whatever is currently believed" -- it always
resolves through a version registered in :data:`PATCHSETS`, so a receipt
that records ``patchset = "v1"`` records a fixed vector, and adding an entry
to the ledger later cannot retroactively change what an old run meant.

GOVERNANCE (why a present key and an absent key are not the same thing)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
When ``physics_mode`` appears in ``[experiment]``, the axis becomes the
AUTHOR of every key its resolved entries name: the loader writes the
resolved value onto every domain and REFUSES an explicit occurrence of that
key in ``[shared]`` or any ``[[domain]]``.  Two authors for one key is the
defect ``woof.experiment._reject_unknown_keys`` exists to prevent, one
level up: the run would be confident, complete, and computed from a value
whose provenance nobody can state.

When ``physics_mode`` is ABSENT the axis authors nothing and every key stays
where it has always been.  Absent is therefore byte-inert for every
configuration that predates this module -- which is the whole tree -- and
its reported mode is still ``"wrf-faithful"``, because that is true: no
registered patch is applied.  The two states differ only in who writes the
key, and which one is in force is visible in the file.

This is also what lets one battery case file serve every arm: the case TOML
omits the governed keys, and the arm is the two-line ``[experiment]``
overlay that selects the mode.  A case file that DOES pin a governed key is
refused by name rather than silently overridden, and the refusal says which
keys the mode governs so the overlay can be composed against
:func:`governed_keys`.
