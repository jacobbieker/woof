"""Run one GFS/ERA5/20CRv3 RW-WPS prepared cache through GPUWM.

The runner accepts a portable direct single-domain output or the external-LBC
d01 bundle in a portable hierarchy published by the public GFS and ERA5
adapters.  It reconstructs the cache identity from the caller-pinned proof,
source manifest, static geometry, experiment, and WPS namelist before importing
CuPy.  WRF-shaped history files are published at the exact cadence bound into
the experiment through woof's existing atomic writer and carry

#: Sources prepared through the declarative mapped route against a

#: :mod:`woof.source_authorities` pins.
#:
#: These share one certificate: the bundle's copied mapping, composition
#: and provenance must be byte-equal to the three documents this
#: distribution ships for that profile.  What differs between them is the
#: SHAPE OF THEIR INPUT MANIFEST, and only that: `20crv3` carries the
#: every-member GRIB2 manifest with its filename-bound member identity,
#: while any composed mapped preparation carries
#: `gpuwm-mapped-composition-inputs-v1`.  Both shapes are validated below;
#: neither pin is relaxed for the other.
#:
#: A row here is what makes a packaged source runnable end to end, and it
#: is a row -- not an arm.  A profile whose composition role is a PENDING
#: declaration (an atmosphere-only source awaiting its cross-source
#: land-surface donor) can never have prepared a bundle, so it holds no
#: row: including it would promise this stage an arm the profile itself
#: refuses to supply.
#: Sentinel for "this identity document has no such key at all", so a
#: difference report can say `absent` rather than `None`, which is a value
#: a field can legitimately hold.

#: imports none of it.  The duplication is held equal by
#: ``tests/test_mp28_runtime_reachability.py``, which imports both and

#: claimed.  This is the route's contract, not a claim about the source.
#:
#: It used to be the empty tuple, and an empty tuple is NOT the
#: conservative reading of "nothing measured here".  tools/build_registry.py
#: completes a served source's ``source_template_ids`` from this evidence
#: row, and that key is the REACHABILITY declaration a front end reads;
#: ``woof.physics_registry.expert_template_ids_for_source`` then withholds
#: the route-wide expert list from any source whose normal list is empty.
#: So the empty row published "this source reaches no named suite at all"
#: about packaged sources this runner supports: all six composition
#: suites and all three Noah-MP expert suites disappeared, and
#: a plan naming one was warned ``template-route-evidence`` instead of
#: being handed the acknowledgement advisory the option exists to raise.
#: The plan still launched, and that is the whole defect: the warning
#: says the template is off-route for this source, which was false.
#: A source with no measurement of its own is PRICED from the most
#: conservative basis on record, which is the one every one of its
#: siblings on this route already reports.

    A plain ``before != after`` conflated unrelated events, and the

    every step integrated, every ``wrfout`` frame written and verified
    -- loses its receipt to ``forecast runtime implementation changed
    during run`` in two shapes that share no code with an implementation
    change:

    * one ``git rev-parse`` failing to spawn at the end of the run,
      which drops :func:`woof.runtime_manifest.provenance` through its
      git branch and re-answers ``identity_source``, ``git_commit``,
      ``git_tree``, ``git_status_short`` and ``installed_wheel`` /
      ``installed_editable`` from a lower rung, all at once (that one is
      now also retried -- see :func:`_runtime_provenance` -- so reaching
      this comparison degraded is rare);
    * the run creating ONE untracked file inside the checkout, which
      appends a ``??`` row to ``git_status_short`` and increments
      ``installed_editable.git.untracked_files``.  ``runs/`` is not
      ignored, so that is not an unusual run: it is a run that writes
      where it was told to.

    So the components are compared on their own terms:

    * ``source_sha256`` is compared ALWAYS and strictly.  It is read
      from bytes on disk, it hashes the ten modules that ARE this
      forecast implementation, it cannot fail to resolve, and it is what
      makes skipping anything else survivable.
    * ``git_commit`` and ``git_tree`` are compared whenever BOTH ends
      resolved them.  ``None`` means "this was not asked", which is an
      unanswered question rather than a changed answer.
      :func:`_runtime_provenance` guarantees both describe REPO, so they
      stay comparable even when the rung underneath them changed.
    * ``git_status_short`` is compared, both ends resolved, over TRACKED
      paths only.
    * ``distribution_manifest_sha256``, ``installed_wheel``,
      ``installed_editable`` and ``installed_source_content`` are
      compared only when the SAME rung answered at both ends.  A sealed
      manifest, a wheel RECORD, an editable git tree and a source tree's
      content answer different questions, and one rung's answer
      measured against another's is not a comparison.
    * ``identity_source`` is not compared at all.  It names which
      RESOLVER answered, not which code is executing, and the only way
      it moves while every digest above holds is the fall-through this
      exists for.  An install genuinely replaced mid-run rewrites the
      ten hashed modules and is caught by ``source_sha256``.

    That is narrower than the old test in exactly one case: a commit
    that lands mid-run, touches none of the ten hashed files and no
    tracked file at all, AND coincides with a git failure at one end.
    Every other real change still fails: a tracked edit to a hashed file
    moves ``source_sha256``, a tracked edit anywhere else moves the
    filtered ``git_status_short``, and a HEAD that moves while git works
    moves ``git_commit``.

    the authority and any suite the engine implements runs; its
    verification status -- "WRF-verified" against a shipped profile, or
    "supported, not yet WRF-verified" -- is recorded in the receipt and

    The registry's source-neutral tuple governance is APPLIED here too,
    on every prepared source, for named, matched and unnamed suites
    alike -- but as a WARNING, not a refusal (warn-not-block ruling):
    an expert-template tuple is implemented and individually verified,
    so an unacknowledged one runs and prints one line naming both
    published delivery spellings, ``--ack <id>`` and
    ``acknowledgements = ["<id>"]`` in the hash-bound experiment, and
    the receipt carries ``acknowledged=false`` either way.  Applying
    the governance is what keeps the removal of the profile whitelist
    from widening consent SILENTLY: pre-ruling, expert tuples could not
    reach the non-GFS lanes at all, and every run record now states
    exactly which unblessed tuple executed.  A caller who NAMES an
    expert ``--physics-profile`` has asked for that gate and still

#
# A streamed forecast integrates out of a pinned host store and never reads
# the resident ``DomainState`` again: ``woof.core.streaming.attach`` copies
# it carrier by carrier into that store and every sweep afterwards writes only
# the store.  Building the state first is nevertheless what this route has
# always done, and it is the CEILING.  MEASURED on a 16 GB card at nz = 49,
# the bare state costs 11 276.5 B per column and the prepared case -- state
# plus physics plus geography plus boundary tables -- about 15 780, so
# 1024 x 1024 is refused inside ``initialize_physics`` while the streamed
# forecast that state would have fed needs about 6 GiB and runs comfortably.
# The streamed engine on the same card has stepped 2624 x 2624.
#
# ``woof.ingest.prepared_store.store_from_prepared_cache`` fills the same
# store one ROW SLAB at a time -- slab-height state, physics attached to THAT,
# scattered into full-domain pinned host arrays -- so no domain-shaped device
# array is ever allocated and the domain the card can carry stops being a
# property of the card.  ``--stream-init`` chooses between the two roads.
#
# ``auto`` prefers the RESIDENT road wherever it comfortably fits, and that
# preference is deliberate rather than conservative: the resident road is the
# one every existing receipt was written by, and the two roads' agreement is
# proven by running a domain small enough for both and comparing frames.  The
# store-direct road is taken when the priced resident state does not fit,
# which is precisely the case the resident road cannot serve at all.

#: MEASURED bytes per column at nz = 49 on this route
#: (the streamed-ceiling measurement record, section 2): a bare
#: ``DomainState`` costs 11 276.5 B/column, and the prepared case -- the same
#: state plus everything ``initialize_prepared_physics`` puts on the card
#: beside it (the physics carriers, the geography inventory and the lateral

#: The ``nz`` both per-column measurements were taken at.  They are scaled
#: LINEARLY in ``nz`` off this reference, which is the accurate reading of one
#: measurement at one height: the prepared case is overwhelmingly 3-D arrays,
#: and the 2-D surface inventory that does not scale is a small enough share
#: that pretending it does costs a slight OVER-price below nz = 49 and a
#: slight under-price above it -- both inside the fit fraction's margin.

#: What the prepared case costs as a multiple of the state the cache carries
#: (1.40).  DERIVED from the two measurements above rather than written as a
#: bare 1.4, so that a later measurement moves the number and the evidence for
#: it in one edit and neither can drift away from the other.
#:
#: THIS RATIO IS NOT THE PRICE OF THE RESIDENT ROAD, and reading it as one is
#: the defect the pricing below was rebuilt to remove.  It relates the prepared
#: case to a BARE ``DomainState``; the cache's ``state/*`` manifest is not a
#: bare DomainState but the far smaller ``STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS`` subset --
#: the dynamics and microphysics prognostics only, with none of the RK and
#: dycore working arrays a ``DomainState`` allocates beside them and none of
#: what ``initialize_prepared_physics`` then puts on the card.  MEASURED on the
#: 1024 x 1024 x 49 gate cache: ``state/*`` is 4 945 485 824 B, which is
#: 4 716.4 B per column against the bare state's 11 276.5 -- the manifest
#: undercounts the state alone by 2.39x, and ``manifest x 1.40`` therefore

    that silence and concluded a hang.  One line and one status flip, only
    when the kernel cache says the compile is really about to happen.

    Shared by both initialization roads: the store-direct road pays the same
    compile inside its first slab, and a road that skipped this would
    reintroduce exactly the silence for the runs most likely to be long.

    The card is asked here, not inside the notice module: this runner has

    is keyed by architecture, so 7,164 entries for the previous card are
    7,164 entries this run cannot load.

    ``census`` is the cache reading taken before this run compiled
    anything.  It is not optional in practice and the reason is
    measured: by the time this function is reached, this run's own
    first kernels are already in the cache it would otherwise scan, so

    ``observer`` is an optional second consumer of this run's progress,
    for a caller driving the runner in-process rather than reading its
    ``progress.json`` from outside (:class:`woof.runplan.RunObserver`
    is one).  It receives every per-step progress event this runner
    already builds, and -- if it carries the ``output_committed`` hook
    -- each wrfout as it becomes durable.  ``None`` leaves every byte of
    this runner's behaviour unchanged.

    ``first_products`` is a :class:`woof.first_products.FirstProducts`
    this runner OWNS, for the command line rather than for a host.  It
    exists because the feature was reachable only through a host: arming
    lives on ``RunObserver`` and on ``woof go``, so ``python -m
    woof.prepared_single_domain_forecast`` published its analysis frame
    -- fsynced, self-validated and renamed, minutes before the forecast
    ends -- with nothing watching.  MEASURED consequence: reaching a
    89 s launch-to-first-plot on this route took an EXTERNAL process
    polling the frames for ``GPUWM_WRITE_COMPLETE``, which is a watcher
    reimplementing a hook the writer already raises.  ``None`` -- and
    every invocation that names no products -- changes nothing.

    ``stream_init`` is ``--stream-init``: which road a STREAMED forecast
    builds its domain on.  ``"auto"`` (the default) prices the resident
    road against the card's free memory -- from this domain's own columns
    at the route's MEASURED cost per column, and from the cache manifest,
    whichever is larger -- and takes it wherever it comfortably fits,
    otherwise the store; ``"resident"`` and ``"store"`` force one.  A
    forecast that does not stream ignores it entirely -- there is no
    second road when the resident state IS the domain -- so a run without
    ``[tiles]`` executes byte for byte what it executed before this
    parameter existed, through the same calls.

    ``progress_options`` is :class:`woof.progress_log.ProgressOptions`,
    the four ``--progress-*`` / ``--frame-markers`` flags.  ``None`` is
    the DEFAULT SET, not silence: this runner prints WRF's per-step
    ``Timing for main:`` lines, writes ``progress.jsonl`` beside its
    outputs and publishes a frame-ready marker per durable history file
    unless a caller has asked it not to.  The reason it defaults on is
    the report this feature came from -- a run that says nothing about
    which step it is on cannot be driven from a script, and "the user
    did not pass a flag" is not a reason to withhold that.

      pictures" means without a second switch to disagree with.

      the render on its observer before it calls this runner, with the
      dict its own finalize stage will use.  Arming a second trigger on
      the same directory would render the same frame twice, publish two

      which worker finished last.  The host's arming wins and this says
      so, because a flag that was passed and quietly did nothing is the

    The report/warn pair is what a hosted run gets from its event
    stream, spelled for a process that has none: one line on stdout at
    the instant the pictures became readable -- carrying the seconds
    from launch, which IS the time-to-first-plot number -- and one line
    on stderr for every way the render declined.  The receipt itself is
    unchanged: :mod:`woof.first_products` writes
