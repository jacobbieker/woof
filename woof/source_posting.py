"""When each lead of a source's cycle is due, and how long a run waits for it.

A run that starts on a source's first hours and waits for the rest needs
two facts per lead: when the lead should be on the server, and how long
past that the run keeps waiting before it says the source fell behind.
Both are table rows.  The first is the source's ``publication_lag`` rule
(the EARLIEST posting seen of each lead, per cycle hour and per lead,
:class:`woof.source_cycles.PublicationRule`), read through the source's
cycle grid so a route and a legacy transport answer through one
function.  The second is the source's ``posting`` block
(:class:`woof.fetch_routes.PostingRow`): its shape, how a lead is asked
about, the lateness budget and the poll ceiling.

Nothing here names a source.  A model added as a route row with a
``posting`` block has a schedule with no edit here, which is the
arbitrary acceptance test.  Nothing here reaches a network either: the
schedule is arithmetic on the rows, and asking a host whether a lead is
there belongs to the fetch loop that reads this schedule.

A tree adds start needs of its own (:func:`nest_start_needs`): a nest that
starts after the forecast (``start_time`` later than the root's) is
prepared from the source's analysis at its own start time
(``woof.ingest.nest_init``), so its lead joins the run's start needs
(``nest_start:dNN``) beside the root's analysis and first boundary lead.
Children that start with the root add nothing.
