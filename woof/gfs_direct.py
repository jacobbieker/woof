    substitute WSM6 when no profile was named and compare the config's
    switches against it for exact equality, so the product default suite
    -- and every hand-authored suite -- was refused at preparation time.
    That whitelist is gone: an UNNAMED configuration, one domain or a

    governed -- engine-valid selectors, the registry's source-neutral
    tuple governance with its expert acknowledgements, and a recorded
    blocker (never a refusal) where the registry has no spelling for an
    engine-valid tuple.  Verification status is receipt metadata.

    v1.1.0's regression (this whitelist binding at the front door for
    every configuration, refusing the wizard's default emission as a
    stack trace) and v1.1.1's scoping fix are recorded in this module's
    history; the 2026-07-31 ruling removed the single-domain half too.

    An explicitly named profile is still enforced on either route,
    because a gate the caller asked for remains binding: naming
    ``--physics-profile`` asserts the config IS that shipped suite.

    decodes each lead batch as its markers appear, publishes its head from
    the start time binding the INPUT PLAN (every lead, every object name,
    every other input) instead of the input manifest, which does not
    exist yet, and at its seal writes the input manifest at
    ``input_manifest`` (``input_manifest_sha256`` is then ``None``), the
    decoder receipts and the one-shot identity, byte for byte what a
    preparation of the same bytes after the whole window writes.

    ``geog_root`` activates the internal multi-domain route when the
    experiment declares children.  The existing public single-domain CLI is
    unchanged; source-neutral public hierarchy configuration is owned by the
    higher-level integration layer.

    ``stock_wrf_export`` asks for the bonus unchanged-WRF file set beside
    the forecast this prepares, on the single-domain route and the
    domain-tree route alike.  It defaults to True, so a domain the
    exporter can represent publishes exactly what it always published.
    One it cannot represent (Kessler, Milbrandt-Yau and WDM6 have no
    stock package contract) does not fail: the export is refused, by
    name, in the proof's export slot, and the forecast preparation
    completes, because the forecast restores the prepared cache, not the
    exported files.  Which physics a forecast may run belongs to the
    registry and the acknowledgement gate, not to a downstream
    file-format contract.  Pass False to skip the export outright; the
    slot then records it as not requested.  On the single-domain route an
    export that is written must carry exactly the physics this
    preparation selected, or the preparation stops.

    ``statics_corridor`` opts the DOMAIN-TREE route into emitting sealed
    child-resolution statics corridors (``"all"`` or a sequence of child
    grid ids; :mod:`woof.static.corridor`), which is what lets the
    prepared tree runner honor ``[relocation]`` follow sources.  ``None``
    (the default) leaves every published byte exactly as before.

    """A GFS domain tree, chained: head, one root interval per segment, seal.

    The head holds the root's static files and start state (streamed cache
    under ``hierarchy-head/domains/d01/prepared-cache``, its header written
    at the seal) and every child's complete artifact set under
    ``hierarchy-head/domains/dNN``: a child, a delayed one included, needs
    only its start-time snapshot and the root's start state
    (:func:`woof.native_hierarchy.initialize_native_hierarchy_children`).
    A tree whose nest moves has its statics corridor built into
    ``hierarchy-head/statics-corridor`` and bound by the head's proof: it
    needs no boundary time, and a forecast started on the head moves the
    nest over it.  Segment k is the root's boundary interval k.  No start state stays
    resident between head and seal, on either backend: the seal re-reads
    the root (with its whole boundary set) and every child from the head
    (:class:`woof.ingest.boundary_stream.TreeStartStates`) and writes the
    one-shot ``hierarchy-artifacts/`` tree from them, through the same
    writer and the same arguments as the unchained tree, then the
    companion WRF files and the corridor (copied from the head), then
    ``proof.json``.  The top-level static cache, geometry receipt, source manifest and decoder receipts
    were staged before the head and are published with it.

    As posted (``c.posted_tree``, DESIGN A136 2.4 and the L3 design
    ruling), the head is written from the start lead (and a delayed
    nest's start lead, which its child's preparation waits for) before
    the input manifest exists: the root's and every child's identity bind
    the input plan's placeholder where the manifest digest goes, the head
    binds the plan and the markers its own decode read, and each segment
    the markers of its two times.  The seal writes the input manifest and
    the decoder receipts from the lead batches, seals the root cache under
    the one-shot identity, writes the one-shot ``hierarchy-artifacts/``
    tree with the manifest's digest, holds every sealed child to its head
    twin (:func:`woof.ingest.boundary_stream.verify_as_posted_tree_children`)
    and adds the proof keys that read every lead.  A moving or cyclone
    nest adds no start need and no lead: its corridor needs no boundary
    time and is built into the head as before.

    ``woof fetch --author-front-door-manifest`` already prints the

    single most-praised thing in the pilots.  Nothing did the equivalent
    here: the front door finished by dumping 42 KB of proof.json to
    stdout and printing no next step at all, so every user hand-extracted
    three SHA-256 values -- one of them only findable by grepping the
    JSON for ``content_sha256`` -- before they could start a forecast.

    Everything below is already known to this process.  Emitted on
    stderr so the proof document on stdout stays machine-readable.

    **Every line printed as a command must run when pasted, exactly as
    printed.**  v1.0.0 printed ``--physics-profile <the profile this
    config was materialized for>`` and ``--outdir OUTPUT_DIR``: two
    placeholders in a command whose entire value was that a user did not
    have to reconstruct it, and the second one is a shell metacharacter
    error rather than an accurate gap.  Both are resolved here -- the
    profile by asking the same table the runner's guard asks, the outdir
    by naming a real directory beside the preparation.  Where a value
    genuinely cannot be resolved, this prints prose saying so instead of
    a command that cannot be run.

    When the proof carries a ``gpuwm-front-door-physics-selection-v1``
    receipt (proof v3 and later), that receipt IS what was materialized,
    so it names the profile.  Re-deriving it from the config would be a
    second opinion about a decision already recorded.  The config-table
    lookup stays as the fallback for the historical v2 proof, which
    carries no physics receipt.

    ``source`` names the prepared-forecast runner's own ``--source``
    value.  Every native front door that reaches a prepared bundle can
    print this, and one of them printing a complete hash-bound command
    while another printed nothing at all was a a development machine finding in its own
    right: the 20CRv3 route ran end to end and then said nothing about
