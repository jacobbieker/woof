"""WRF v4.7.1's namelist vocabulary, read from the packaged table.

``woof/data/wrf_namelist/registry_v4.7.1.json`` is extracted from WRF's
own Registry by ``tools/wrf_namelist_registry.py`` (one row per ``rconfig
... namelist,<group>`` line the ARW build compiles).  Two consumers:

* the importer's unmapped-key refusal names the group WRF declares a
  misplaced key in (``gwd_opt`` has been a ``&dynamics`` key since WRF
  v4.0), so the refusal has one obvious repair;
* the namelist contract (:mod:`woof.namelist_contract`) checks every key
  WRF can read against the importer, so none reaches a user unclassified.
