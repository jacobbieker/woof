"""Single-writer discipline and atomic publication for the fetch layer.

Every ``woof fetch*`` flow writes into a directory that a later run --
or a *concurrent* run -- reads back as authority.  Two properties have
to hold for that to be safe, and neither is free:

**One writer at a time.**  The request-identity guard, the mutation of
the payloads, and the publication of the receipt that blesses them are
three separate steps.  Interleave two processes across them and the
final receipt can describe the other process's bytes.  Every mutating
flow therefore takes an exclusive, OS-enforced lock on its output root
first: a Windows byte-range lock / POSIX ``flock`` on a lock file kept
outside the output tree (so it never lands in a fetched directory and
never confuses the nonempty-output guard).  The kernel releases it when
the holder dies, which a cooperative sentinel file cannot promise --
a crashed fetch must not leave a directory permanently unfetchable.
The loser announces the wait, waits, and then refuses loudly naming the
holder; it never proceeds in parallel and never silently doubles work.
A caller that can see the holder's work (the bytes a download has
staged) passes it as ``holder_progress``, and the loser then waits as
long as that work keeps moving and refuses only a holder that stalls.

**Nothing is published half-written.**  Text receipts are written to a
temp that is unique per call -- a fixed ``.tmp`` is exactly the file two
writers collide on -- claimed exclusively under a compact random name
that never repeats the target's own (so a folder deep enough to hold a
file is deep enough to stage it), flushed, fsynced, atomically renamed,
and the containing directory is fsynced too where the platform allows
it.  Quarantine names are proven absent before the rename, so
moving evidence aside can never overwrite older evidence.

**A write this computer refuses is not a download that failed.**  A
folder too deep for Windows or a full disk used to surface through the
network handler as "download failed ...; a re-run resumes".
:func:`receive` and :class:`LocalWriteFailed` keep the two apart, and
:func:`local_write_refusal` names the path's length and the fix.

Nothing here deletes anything.  Quarantine moves aside; the lock file
is the only file this module creates on its own, and it lives in the
per-user lock root, not in the fetched output.
