"""Locate the built Rust bridge executables outside a source checkout.

A platform wheel SHIPS the compiled Rust: the fail-closed GRIB decoders
and the CPU preprocessing library are built from the vendored
``tools/grib1_bridge`` workspace (``cargo build --release --locked
--offline``) and staged into :func:`packaged_bridge_dir` before the
wheel is built, so ``pip install recast-woof`` lands a complete install on
every platform a bundle exists for.  This module is the single
resolution mechanism shared by ingest (:func:`woof.ingest.grib
.build_rust_bridge`), ``woof doctor``, and documentation:

1. an explicit per-executable environment variable
   (:data:`BRIDGE_ENV`) naming the built file;
2. a source checkout's own ``tools/grib1_bridge/target/{release,debug}``
   build tree (the developer path -- ingest may also *build* there);
3. ``<root>/libexec/bridges`` beside the package (the sealed runtime
   archive layout);
4. :func:`packaged_bridge_dir` -- ``woof/libexec/bridges`` INSIDE the
   installed package, which is what a platform wheel carries.  It sits
   below the checkout rungs so a developer's own build still wins, and
   above ``~/.woof/bridges`` because bytes shipped with this version
   are version-matched by construction while a fetched bundle is only
   as fresh as the last ``woof fetch-bridges``;
5. the user-level default directory :func:`default_bridge_dir`
   (``~/.woof/bridges/<release>-<bundle digest>`` for a pinned
   install, the flat ``~/.woof/bridges`` otherwise), which ``woof
   fetch-bridges`` (:mod:`woof.bridge_assets`) stages the release's
   prebuilt bundle into, and where a wheel user otherwise copies their
   own build once;
6. for a pinned install only, the flat legacy ``~/.woof/bridges``
   (:func:`legacy_bridge_candidates`), read when its bytes are this
   release's pin and never written.

The ``py3-none-any`` fallback wheel -- the one pip resolves on a
platform with no published bundle -- carries no rung 4, and every
consumer of a missing artifact must refuse BY NAME with
:func:`artifact_remedy` rather than degrade into a Python
reimplementation of the decoder.

Nothing here runs cargo.  Resolution has one side effect and one
only: an artifact staged in rung 5 that is not the one this release
pinned is re-fetched before it is handed to a door
(:func:`require_release_pin`), because that rung is the one a ``pip
install -U woof`` leaves untouched -- new Python, last release's
binaries.  Readers that must see the estate as it is, ``woof doctor``
first among them, resolve inside :func:`inspection_only`, where the
guarantee is the original one.

#: not touch them.  1.1.0 changed the GFS series file from two columns
#: to three; a 1.0.1 bridge still launched, still printed its usage
#: diagnostic, and `woof doctor` therefore reported it `ok` -- and then
#: every preparation died with `series line 1 must be HOUR<TAB>GRIB2`,
#: a message that blames the series file woof had just written
#: correctly.  A a development machine validation run found the cause only by diffing
#: two git tags.
#:
#: Each marker is a literal the CURRENT contract compiles into the
#: binary and the previous one did not, so a stale build fails the
#: handshake statically -- no execution, no new bridge CLI surface, and

#: before sealing a distribution, applied one step earlier: at the
#: doctor report, which is where a user looks before they burn a run.

#: Adding a marker is part of changing a bridge contract.  Choose the

    other side ("rustup edits the login profile, which does nothing for
    the shell already running"), so this is that knowledge applied at the
    place that runs the command instead of only in the remedy text.

    The ladder, in order, and it runs nothing:

    1. ``CARGO``, the toolchain's own environment variable, so an
       explicit choice always wins -- the same override
       ``tools/battery/run_cargo_gates.py --cargo`` offers its lane;
    2. PATH, which is what a developer shell has;
    3. rustup's own home, ``$CARGO_HOME/bin`` or ``~/.cargo/bin``, which
       is where every rustup install puts the shim.

    Resolving to the SHIM rather than to a pinned toolchain is
    deliberate: the shim is what reads a ``rust-toolchain.toml``, so a
    crate in this tree can declare the toolchain it needs and be obeyed
    by every route without a version being hard-coded here.  No such
    file exists today and none is added by this function: measured, the
    bridge crates build on 1.93.1, and pinning a newer toolchain would
    refuse a toolchain that works.

    """Give a wheel-shipped artifact back its executable bit.

    ``pip`` honours a staged member's recorded mode when the high half
    of its zip ``external_attr`` is a whole ``st_mode`` with the
    regular-file type bit included: its ``zip_item_is_executable``
    tests ``S_ISREG`` before it reads the execute bits.  ``setup.py``
    writes that mode today, so a wheel built from this tree installs its
    bridge binaries executable and this function finds nothing to
    repair.  Measured on the rebuilt manylinux wheel: all 28 staged
    artifacts read back ``0o100755``, and a ``pip install`` into a clean
    venv leaves every one of them 775 and passing
    ``os.access(..., os.X_OK)``.

    It is kept for the wheels that do not carry that mode.  A wheel
    published before that fix stamped ``0o755`` with no file-type bits,
    so pip's predicate rejected it and wrote the binaries 0644, and the
    same is true of a bundle laid down by any other route that stamps no
    mode.  That failure is measured, not theorised: a clean-venv install
    of such a wheel put all eleven artifacts in place and then died with
    ``PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied`` on the first
    ``subprocess.run``.  This function is the repair for bytes that are
    already published, not a substitute for the stamping: reverting
    ``setup.py``'s constants on the strength of it existing would put
    that defect back for every door that resolves a bridge by another
    route.

    The repair is done at resolution rather than asked of the user,
    because "fixed" means a bare ``pip install recast-woof`` works: a flag or a
    documented ``chmod +x`` would be a workaround, and this defect is
    invisible until a door is already being opened.

    Only files inside :func:`packaged_bridge_dir` are touched -- a
    checkout build, a ``~/.woof/bridges`` copy or an environment
    override belongs to the user, and silently re-permissioning those
    would be changing something this package does not own.  A no-op on

    One function, called by the preparation wrapper AND by ``woof
    doctor``, because the alternative was two resolvers with different
    answers: the wrapper resolved a *source-tree cargo workspace*
    (``<root>/tools/grib1_bridge/target/release/...``) that exists only
    in a checkout, while doctor resolved the shared ladder in this
    module.  On a wheel install doctor therefore reported the bridge
    ``woof setup`` had staged in ``~/.woof/bridges`` -- correctly --
    and the preparation then went looking under ``site-packages/tools``
    and refused.  "No gaps" followed by a missing file is the exact
    failure a pre-flight exists to prevent, and it can only be prevented
    by asking the same question through the same code.

    Resolution is :func:`bridge_candidates`' order: the environment
    override (a missing file it names is a hard error, never a silent
    fall-through), then a checkout's own build, then ``libexec/bridges``
    beside the package, then the user-level ``~/.woof/bridges`` that
    ``woof fetch-bridges`` stages into.  A checkout's build coming
    before the staged copy is deliberate: a developer's rebuild must win
    over whatever they downloaded last month.

    Existence is not the whole question, so it is not the whole answer.
    A binary built before this release's decoder contract is present,
    executable, and wrong, and until 1.8.9 this function returned it:
    ``woof doctor`` asked :func:`bridge_abi_matches` afterwards and the
    production preparation did not, so a stale bridge passed the door
    that runs it while the report that checks it said green.  A 12-byte
    text file planted at each override path was returned by all three
    sources.  The gate lives INSIDE the resolver now -- one question,
    one answer, no second call for a caller to forget.

    ``mode`` additionally requires a capability the decoder declares in
    :data:`DECODER_MODE_CONTRACTS` (``"as_posted"`` is append-only lead
    admission). An older decoder remains valid for its complete window
    mode but cannot be returned for a command it does not implement, and
    a decoder that declares no such mode is refused by name.

    Nothing here runs cargo, so it is safe to call from a report.

    Two installs, two different true answers.  In a source checkout the

    real destination path, not a ``<clone>`` the reader has to expand.
    On a pip install there is no crate at all, so the remedy starts from
    the clone; printing the checkout's one-liner there names a directory
    that does not exist and reads as a broken install.

    Every continuation line is a command or a ``#`` comment, so the
    whole block survives being pasted in one go.  The guidance that used
    to trail as bare prose (``then EITHER set ...``) is commented for
    exactly that reason: a reader who selects the block should not have
    to prune it first.

    One implementation for the bridges, the renderer and the fetch
    backbone.  Three copies is how two of them kept ``<clone>`` and the
    "exact copy-pasteable" claim after the third stopped saying it.

    On a pip install there is now a third true answer, when the release
    published a bundle this platform can run: one download, verified
    against the packaged pins.  It leads, and the clone-and-build route
    follows it commented out -- still printed, because it is the only
    route on a platform with no bundle, and commented because a reader
    who pastes the report must not also compile what the line above
    already staged.

    ``artifact`` is the bundle name of the thing being remedied, and
    passing it is how a caller says "check that the bundle carries THIS
    one" rather than "check that a bundle exists".  See
    :func:`prebuilt_bundle_offer` for the wave that cost.  Callers that
    omit it get the old behaviour, which is correct for the artifacts
