"""Where a source's native grid reaches, computed from declared table data.

A REGIONAL source is one whose native grid stops somewhere: ICON-EU ends at
the edge of Europe, RAP at the edge of North America, HRRR and RRFS at the
edge of the CONUS Lambert.  Every front door that plans against a source --
the ``woof domain`` wizard's fitted root, ``woof fetch``'s ``--area``
gate -- has to be able to ask "does this source reach my target", and the
answer must be the SAME answer in both places or the wizard emits a plan the
fetch refuses (the field defect that retired the hand-held CONUS box).

The answer is table data.  A row in :mod:`woof.source_adapters` declares
the source's grid with the numbers a GRIB grid-definition section already
carries; this module turns that declaration into the two things a front door
asks for.  Adding a regional model is therefore a row, not a function -- the
arbitrary acceptance test applied to coverage.

The two questions, and why they are not the same question:

``envelope()``
    The ``(south, west, north, east)`` lat/lon bounding box, for clamping and
    formatting an ``--area`` hint.  For a wide Lambert grid the bounding box
    is LOOSER than the grid (grid 221's top row swings past 85 N), so it is
    the right shape for a box to be clamped into and the wrong shape for a
    refusal -- it would accept ground the grid does not carry.

``outside()`` / ``locate()``
    Exact membership in the source's OWN index space, which is the test the
    preparation stage performs on real bytes.  A refusal is built on this
    one, so the wizard refuses exactly what the preparation would refuse and
    can name the offending point in the source's coordinates.

Two declared families cover every regional product woof ships a profile
for, and neither is a per-model code path:

``RegularLatLonWindow``
    The product is published on a regular lat/lon window, so the window IS
    the grid (DWD's ICON-EU: the four numbers DWD publishes as the grid
    description).

``LambertGridWindow``
    The product is published on a Lambert conformal grid, so membership and
    envelope both come from walking the declared mass grid through the same
    projection transcription WPS uses (:mod:`woof.static.lambert`).  The
    envelope is exact rather than sampled: the projected pole lies outside
    the grid rectangle, latitude is monotone in projected distance from the
    pole point and longitude in angle around it, so every lat/lon extreme
    over the convex rectangle is attained on its boundary.

A source with no window declared is GLOBAL -- it reaches every target, and
the front doors apply no coverage bound at all.

``config_source_coverage_refusal()`` asks the same question of a written
config's root, for plan review and the ``woof prep`` door.  It lives here,
beside the windows it reads, because the RW-WPS preprocessing wheel ships
this module and not the domain wizard.
