"""When a source has an initialization, and when its bytes land.

``--cycle latest`` asks one question -- what is the newest init this
source can serve -- and three model names used to answer it.
:func:`woof.fetch.resolve_latest_cycle` branched on gfs/gdas/hrrr and
refused everything else with a sentence about ERA5's publication delay,
which a reader asking for RAP or ICON-EU got verbatim.  In a registry of
thirty-two sources that is the per-model bandaid the arbitrary
acceptance test bans, and it made a reanalysis unaskable for a time it
publishes perfectly well.

The question is answered from DECLARED FACTS instead:

``hours``          the UTC hours of day this producer initializes on.
``delay_hours``    how long after a nominal init its bytes are on a
                   server.  Zero where a completeness PROBE decides
                   publication -- the probe IS the answer there, and a
                   declared delay would only start the walk-back late.
``delays``         the same fact per cycle hour and per lead, where the
                   producer's timing differs between its cycles (a fetch
                   route's ``publication_lag`` rows, :class:`PublicationRule`).
                   ``delay_hours`` is then the longest first-object delay,
                   for a reader that asks without naming a cycle.  Each
                   rule is the EARLIEST posting seen, where the probed
                   ``latest`` walk starts, plus how much later the latest
                   posting seen came: a reader that no probe checks
                   (``settled``) waits for that one instead.
``usual_delay_hours``  where the probe decides (``delay_hours`` zero),
                   how long after a nominal init the whole run is
                   usually on the server, measured.  The page's answer
                   while no probe has answered: a start this old is
                   taken as published unless a check found it missing.
                   Unset, it reads as ``delay_hours``.
``search_hours``   how far back ``latest`` walks the grid before it
                   gives up and says so.
``record_end``     the last init of a CLOSED archive, or ``None`` for a
                   producer still running.  An archive that ended still
                   has a newest init, and it is not "now minus a delay".

A source with a fetch route already declares its grid there
(``woof.fetch_routes.Route.cycle_hours``, measured against the
producer), so :func:`cycle_grid_for` READS that rather than asking this
module to repeat it: a model added as a route-table row gets ``latest``
with no edit here at all.  What this module carries is the sources whose
schedule nothing else declares, and the shape every answer is given in.

A row that declares no grid and has no route is not on a list of the
unsupported -- :func:`cycle_grid_for` returns ``None`` and the caller
refuses by naming what the row lacks, which is a sentence that stays
true when the row grows.
