"""``woof speedrun`` -- run a named course end to end and seal the capsule.

The door drives the SHIPPED chain (``woof go`` as a subprocess, with the
course's own config and the course's own product list) rather than a
private sequence of stages.  That is deliberate: a benchmark that runs a
path no user runs measures a path nobody has.  Everything this module
adds is measurement and refusal -- the work itself is the front door a
reader already types.

What happens off the clock, and why:

* **Fetching.**  The bytes are staged before the door is called; the
  course names them and the door digests them, but no download is timed.
* **The device and stack probe.**  Asking the card its name is not
  forecasting.
* **The cache census.**  Reading the kernel cache decides which class the
  record belongs to; it happens before the clock so the decision cannot
  be made after seeing the time.
* **``go``'s own fetch stage.**  With ``--data-dir`` pointing at the
  staged bytes it revalidates them and downloads nothing.  Its wall is
  recorded in ``clock.off_clock`` and subtracted, by name, from the
  process wall.

Everything else -- authority, manifest, preparation, forecast (kernel
compile included), render -- is on the clock.
