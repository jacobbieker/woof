"""``woof fetch-geog``: download and stage the WPS_GEOG static tree.

The WRF static builder opens nine fixed WPS_GEOG dataset directories
(:data:`woof.domain_wizard.GEOG_DATASETS`); until this command existed,
staging them was entirely manual.  ``fetch-geog`` downloads the dataset
tarballs, verifies every byte, extracts them into the standard layout,
and validates each dataset the same way ``woof doctor`` does (the
``index`` file must exist -- here it must also parse).

The pin table is wider than those nine: the MPAS static builder
(``rw_mpas_static``) also reads the Noah-MP soil products, which arrive
as one ``soilgrids`` archive holding seven dataset directories under a
common parent.  A pin declares such children in ``index_subdirs`` so
validation looks for the index where it actually is, which keeps a
multi-dataset product table work rather than a second code path.

WHICH DOOR needs a pin is a column of that table too
(:data:`GEOG_CONSUMERS`, and each pin's ``required_by``), not a branch
in the code that reads it.  ``wrf`` is the WRF static builder's nine;
``mesh`` is what ``woof mesh`` must open to write the static half of
its pair, which is seven of those nine plus the soil archive.  Every
reader -- the default fetch set, ``--datasets wrf``, and each of
``woof doctor``'s two completeness verdicts -- is that column read at
a different scope, so adding a dataset for a future door is a row and a
consumer name rather than a new code path.

The soil archive is a REQUIRED download for the mesh door and no part
of a WRF-only install.  It is large (864 MB compressed, ~13 GB
unpacked) and the default fetch stages it anyway, because a tree the
installer called complete and ``woof mesh`` then refuses is worse than
a long download nobody was surprised by.  ``--datasets wrf`` is the
spelling for an operator who knows the mesh door is not theirs.

Two download sources serve byte-identical archives:

* ``hf`` -- a byte-for-byte mirror on Hugging Face
  (:data:`HF_MIRROR_BASE_URL`), a verbatim copy of the NCAR per-dataset
  tarballs republished for CDN bandwidth with attribution.  Every
  archive is verified against the size + SHA-256 pins in
  :data:`GEOG_ARCHIVES` before extraction.
* ``ncar`` (default) -- the upstream NCAR server (:data:`NCAR_BASE_URL`), a single
  host that can be slow.  NCAR publishes no checksums, so the same pins
  apply; they were computed from a TLS download from UCAR on
  2026-07-29, which is the accurate limit of first-download integrity for
  this source (see docs/public/DATA.md).  If NCAR republishes an
  archive the pin mismatch refuses loudly; ``--allow-upstream-drift``
  accepts the new bytes when the size stays inside a sanity band, and
  records the archive as unpinned in the local manifest.

The optional lake-depth and BNU soil archives are available from NCAR only. Source
availability is declared per archive; a request through the mirror uses
the declared upstream source for a dataset the mirror does not carry.

``--bundle`` fetches NCAR's single ``geog_high_res_mandatory.tar.gz``
(2.6 GB compressed, ~29 GB unpacked) instead of the per-dataset
tarballs and extracts only the requested datasets from it.  The bundle
exists only on NCAR.  The per-dataset route downloads half as many
bytes (~1.3 GB) and is the default.

Downloads are resumable (HTTP Range against the recorded partial), a
complete verified archive or an already-valid dataset directory is
never re-downloaded, and every fetch appends to a local
``geog-fetch-manifest.json`` recording url/bytes/sha256 per archive for
future re-verification.

No case is named here; WPS_GEOG is a public static dataset, not a case.

    """One WPS_GEOG dataset tarball, pinned by size and SHA-256.

    ``dataset`` is the extracted top-level directory name (equal to the
    entry in :data:`woof.domain_wizard.GEOG_DATASETS`); ``filename`` is
    the tarball name, identical on NCAR and the mirror.  The pins were
    computed from the NCAR bytes on 2026-07-29 (sizes independently
    confirmed against the server's Content-Length); the mirror serves
    the same bytes, so one pin covers both sources.
    ``extracted_bytes`` is the measured sum of member sizes -- sizing
    information for humans, not a verification bar.

    ``index_subdirs`` names the child directories that carry the WPS
    ``index`` when one archive ships several datasets under a common
    top-level directory.  Most archives are a single dataset and leave it
    empty, which keeps the index at ``<dataset>/index``.  Declaring the
    children here rather than special-casing an archive name is what lets
    a future multi-dataset product be table work instead of a new code
    path.

    ``in_mandatory_bundle`` records whether NCAR's single mandatory-fields
    bundle carries this dataset.  That is a measured fact about that one
    archive, so a pin whose presence in it nobody has verified says False
    and ``--bundle`` refuses the dataset up front instead of extracting
    nothing and calling it done.

    ``required_by`` names the doors that cannot open without this pin,
    from :data:`GEOG_CONSUMERS`.  It replaced a single ``optional`` flag,
    which could only say "somebody needs this" and "nobody does" -- and
    the archive nine-tenths of installs never open is the one the mesh
    door hard-requires, so that flag made ``woof doctor`` choose between
    demanding 13 GB of a WRF-only box and calling a tree complete that
    ``woof mesh`` refuses.  Scoped by consumer, each verdict reads its
    own column and both are right. ``optional_for`` names consumers that
    read a dataset only when a selected model option needs it. It does not
    change the consumer's mandatory geography set.

    ``available_sources`` lists the hosts that carry these exact bytes.
