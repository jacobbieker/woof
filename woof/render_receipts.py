    beside it.  Three fields, added to the schema rather than replacing
    anything: ``status``, ``pictures_on_disk`` counted from the tree,
    and the path of the banner that states the stop in words.

    An existing summary is AMENDED.  It is the early render's own record
    of what it drew and which families it skipped, and a reader that
    keyed on those rows must not find them gone because the run stopped.

    A render directory with pictures but no summary gets one written.
    That happens when a delivery published PNGs without an invocation
    receipt beside them, and without this the pictures would be on disk
    with no document naming them, which is the state every reader treats
    as "this run drew nothing".  Its ``count_basis`` says the count was
    taken from the tree, so no reader mistakes it for a verified
    per-family aggregate.

    A count that could not be TAKEN is not a count of zero.  A picture
    tree whose listing failed arrives as ``pictures_on_disk=None`` with
    the error in ``pictures_error``; the summary then carries a null
    count beside that error rather than a zero every reader would show
    as "this run drew nothing".

    Best effort: a directory that cannot be read or written is not worth
    failing an already-failed run over, and ``None`` comes back.
