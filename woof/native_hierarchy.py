#: What a caller may ask of the stock-WRF export leg of this join.
#:
#: ``"required"``  the export is part of the caller's product; a refusal
#:                 on export-representability propagates and fails the
#:                 whole preparation.
#: ``"optional"``  the caller is preparing a FORECAST and the export is a
#:                 bonus product.  A refusal is recorded in the export
#:                 slot -- with the gate's own message and its named
#:                 selector deltas -- and the preparation proceeds.
#: ``"off"``       no export is attempted at all.
#:
#: The distinction exists because this join used to call the exporter
#: unconditionally, so `export_prepared_wrf`'s profile-free compatibility
#: branch -- which requires the v2 stock slice bl_pbl_physics=1,
#: sf_sfclay_physics=91, sf_surface_physics=2 of the tree ROOT -- decided
#: which domain trees could be prepared on the GFS route at all.  It
#: overruled registry reachability, an accepted `expert-tuple-v1`
#: acknowledgement and an explicitly named shipped profile alike: the only
#: preparable root was YSU + classic-MM5 + Noah, which is exactly what the
#: one shipped hierarchy config happens to be, which is why nothing caught
#: it.  Nothing about the gate's CONTENT changes here -- the export still
#: refuses what it always refused, and still writes no file when it does.

    """Completed native hierarchy artifacts plus unchanged-WRF products.

    ``wrf_manifest`` is the export slot: a READY manifest with a ``files``
    inventory when the export ran, otherwise the NOT_REQUESTED/REFUSED
    document that says why it did not.

    ``moisture_floor_receipts`` is the per-domain answer to "did this
    initialization modify vapour on the way in", root and children alike.
    The child results exist only inside this function, so a proof writer
    downstream has no other way to reach them -- and without them a
    floored nest is a fact that lived in one process's stderr.

    IT HAS NO DEFAULT, deliberately.  Every proof writer spreads this
    mapping into its document unconditionally, so a result built without
    it writes a proof with no ``moisture_floors_by_domain`` key at all --
    and an absent key is the one thing this whole receipt exists to
    prevent, because a reader cannot tell it from "prepared before the
    receipt existed".  An empty default made that a silent construction
    detail; requiring the field makes
    :func:`initialize_and_export_native_hierarchy`, which is the only
    thing that can compute it, the only thing that can build the result.
