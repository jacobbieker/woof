"""``woof version``: which code is actually running, and will pip move it.

A field user upgraded repeatedly and nothing changed.  He had run
``pip install -e ~/gpuwm`` months earlier, at 1.6.2; the editable
install's path entry shadows every wheel pip puts in site-packages, so
each ``pip install --upgrade recast-woof`` succeeded, reported a new version
in its own output, and left the 1.6.2 source tree serving every import.
Nothing in the product told him which code he was running, and the one
number he could see -- ``woof.__version__`` -- is read from
distribution METADATA and therefore reported the number pip had just
written, not the number of the code doing the reporting.

So this command answers four questions the version number alone cannot:

  * WHICH version -- taken from the distribution that actually provides
    the imported package (``installed_distribution`` locates the package
    file that was imported), never from whichever ``.dist-info`` happens
    to carry the name;
  * WHERE the running code lives -- a site-packages wheel, or a source
    tree, with the path;
  * WHETHER pip can move it -- an editable install cannot be upgraded by
    ``pip install --upgrade``, and saying so is the whole point;
  * WHAT the index has -- one PyPI lookup, ONLY when asked for with
    ``--check-pypi``, so "am I behind" does not require a second tool.

The network is opt-in, and when opted into it is strictly last.  A
version command is run inside self-contained installs (the desktop
package's sealed runtime, air-gapped nodes) where an outbound request on
every invocation is a privacy and reproducibility defect, so the default
asks nothing.  With ``--check-pypi`` every identity line is still printed
BEFORE the lookup is attempted, the lookup has a short timeout, and any
failure at all -- offline, proxy, DNS, a 404, a slow index -- prints
nothing rather than an error.  The one line that waits for the lookup is
the wheel upgrade advice, because on an install AHEAD of the index that
advice points backwards and is dropped (UX finding N16); a silent index
keeps it, one timeout later.  ``--offline`` is kept as a no-op so scripts
that passed it keep working.

Like :mod:`woof.update_cli`, this prints and never executes: replacing
a package's files under the process importing them is how a
half-upgraded install happens.
