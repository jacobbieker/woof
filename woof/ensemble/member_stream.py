"""Owned CUDA scopes for concurrent ordinary ensemble members.

Each scope has one stream and allocator. The ordinary model retains every
physics, nest and clock operation; this scope changes only their CUDA queue
and allocation owner. Stream-local physics caches are retired when the queue
has completed, so a finished member cannot retain another wave's scratch.
