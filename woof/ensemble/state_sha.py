"""One canonical content hash for a member's final state (EXPERIMENTAL).

The manifest's ``final_state_sha256`` must mean the same thing whether it
was taken from a live state object at the end of an integration or from
a checkpoint file written by one, so both go through the same reduction:
:data:`woof.io.restart.STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS`, in restart order, each
hashed as ``name\\0dtype\\0shape\\0raw-bytes``.

**What that list is, precisely.**  It is the restart layer's *serialised
state* set, not "the prognostics": it includes the equation-of-state
diagnostics ``p``/``al``/``alt``, the effective radii, and
``h_diabatic``, and it excludes serialised scratch and physics
continuation state -- precipitation accumulators, convective-scheme
timers -- that the restart file also carries.  Two runs agreeing on this
hash agree on the serialised state arrays and on nothing else; calling it
"the prognostic state" oversold it and this docstring is the correction.

**A truncated inventory is reported, never silently normal.**  Both
reductions skip contract attributes that are absent, because partial
states are a real and legitimate input (a synthetic gate checkpoint
carrying four fields is not a broken model state).  What they must not do
is hand back a normal-looking sha for a file holding one array with no
way to tell.  Every reduction therefore also produces an
:func:`state_inventory` -- present, missing, complete -- which the engine
records beside the hash, and ``require_complete=True`` turns an
incomplete inventory into a refusal for callers that know they are
holding a whole state.

Deliberately *not* the sha256 of a wrfout: history files carry creation
metadata, so two byte-identical forecasts do not produce byte-identical
wrfouts and a determinism check against one would be a lie.
