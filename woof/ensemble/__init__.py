"""Sequential single-GPU ensemble orchestration (EXPERIMENTAL).

One member is resident in VRAM at a time.  Members are run by the
existing single-domain experiment runner -- this package adds member
layout, deterministic seeding, a manifest, resume, a cycling skeleton
with a data-assimilation seam, and a bench harness.  It contains no
model loop of its own and no physics.

Everything published here is stamped ``experimental`` in provenance and
is not wired into any default route: the entry point is
``tools/ensemble_forecast.py``.
