"""Sequential single-GPU ensemble orchestration (EXPERIMENTAL).

One member is resident in VRAM at a time.  Members are run by the
existing single-domain experiment runner -- this package adds member
layout, deterministic seeding, a manifest, resume, a cycling skeleton
with a data-assimilation seam, and a bench harness.  It contains no
model loop of its own and no physics.

Everything published here is stamped ``experimental`` in provenance and
is not wired into any default route: the entry point is
``tools/ensemble_forecast.py``.

THE DOOR IS LAZY.  Each exported name is resolved from its submodule the
first time it is read, so importing one submodule does not import the
orchestration stack.  The breakage this prevents: every preparation asks
``woof.ensemble.posted_preparation`` whether a member input is bound, and
the namelist importer reads ``woof.ensemble.stochastic``; with eager
exports each of those imports also pulled ``cycle`` and ``engine``, which
reach the forecast executor, so the standalone RW-WPS preprocessing wheel
(which stages no forecast executor) could not be staged and none of its
preparations could run.
