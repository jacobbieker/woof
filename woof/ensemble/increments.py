"""The DA interface: applying analysis increments (EXPERIMENTAL).

The assimilation step -- whoever implements it -- hands the engine a
plain ``dict[field_name -> ndarray]`` whose arrays match the state's
shapes exactly.  This module is the only thing that touches state on the
DA side, and it is deliberately dumb: add, check, receipt.  It does no
balancing, no localisation, no covariance work of any kind.

Increments are checked before anything is written: an unknown field, a
shape mismatch, a non-finite value, or a dtype that is not a float kind
is a refusal, not a warning.  Half-applied increments are the one
outcome that would silently corrupt a cycling ensemble, so the checks
run over the whole dict first and only then does the apply loop start.

**Finiteness is checked where the value lands, not only where it came
from.**  A ``float64`` increment of ``1e300`` is finite; cast to the
``float32`` a state field actually stores it is ``inf``.  So is a
``float32``-representable increment added to a large enough background.
Validating only the source dtype let both through and wrote ``inf`` into
the analysis, which is exactly the outcome the "a non-finite value is a
refusal" contract exists to prevent.  Every write path therefore checks
the cast addend AND the sum, in the target's own dtype, before anything
is stored -- and computes the sum into a temporary first, so a refusal
leaves the target byte-identical rather than half-poisoned.

**Moment consistency is checked here for the same reason finiteness is.**
This module is the only thing that writes a DA analysis, so it is the
only place a guard cannot be skipped by using a different driver.  A
multi-moment state's mass and number are a pair; an update that moves one
and not the other produces cells holding ``q > 0`` with ``N = 0``, which
the scheme's slope closure evaluates to NaN and the reflectivity operator
correctly refuses to smooth over.  Every write therefore validates the
increment's field set against the pairs the background actually carries
and, after the sum, repairs or refuses the pairs the analysis broke --
see :mod:`woof.da.moments` for the authority each scheme's repair comes
from and for the real-radar cycle that made this necessary.

**Vapour is capped at saturation where the increment moved it.**  An
ensemble increment of theta and vapour knows nothing of the saturation
curve, and nothing downstream of this writer took the excess back until
the scheme's first step condensed it.  A storm-scale child's first radar
analysis left 2.8 to 6.9 Mt of vapour above liquid saturation in a
3,449 km2 box whose backgrounds held under 0.01 Mt; condensed at the first
step it warmed 1 to 3 km by 1.4 to 2.1 K over the whole box, the likely
source of the updrafts that followed.  So
every write here caps the resulting vapour at saturation over liquid water
at the resulting temperature (:func:`_saturation_cap`), at the cells whose
theta or vapour the increment moved, and never below the background's own
supersaturation ratio there (the scheme's state between two of its calls
is not the analysis's to rewrite).  The excess is removed, not moved into
cloud: condensing it into cloud water conserves water only by leaving its
latent heat out, and putting that heat back is the very warming the cap
exists to prevent.  The receipt records the cells and the vapour removed,
and a caller can record it as its own stage (``saturation_observer``).
The ensemble analysis keeps its mean under the same limit first
(:func:`mean_preserving_saturation_bound`), so on an analysed ensemble this
cap is the last guard, not a one-signed sink.

    at or below each member's saturation limit while the filter's own

    Why.  The applier's cap
    (:func:`_saturation_cap`) bounds ONE member at a time: at the cells a
    member's analysed vapour exceeds its limit it removes the excess, and
    at the cells a member is below its limit it adds nothing.  An analysis
    spreads its members about its mean, so wherever the mean sits near
    saturation (the top of an afternoon mixed layer, every cloud) the cap
    cuts the upper tail and keeps the lower one: a one-signed sink of water
    at every analysis, in every member and never in the unanalysed control.
    On a four-minute storm-scale cycle's 1 km child it removed 30 to 44
    g m-2 per member per analysis (1.1 to 1.5 kg m-2 over thirty analyses),
    most of it at 1 to 2.5 km, and the members' 0-2 km air ended 0.6 to 1.2
    g/kg drier than the unanalysed control's (2 m dewpoint 2.6 K below 24
    warm-sector surface stations).  Only about a quarter of it was vapour
    the ensemble mean itself held above saturation.

    The bound is a mean-preserving rule applied to the headroom
    ``s = limit - analysed vapour``, which must be non-negative: wherever
    any member's headroom is negative, every member's non-negative headroom
    is scaled by one factor so the ensemble keeps the filter's mean
    headroom -- and, the limits being fixed, the filter's mean vapour --
    and a member over its limit ends exactly at it.  Where the filter's
    mean is itself over the mean limit every member ends at its limit,
    which is what the cap does for the supersaturation it was installed for
    (2.8 to 6.9 Mt above saturation from a radial-velocity batch's
    vapour).  The limit is
    :func:`saturation_limit`, the cap's own.
