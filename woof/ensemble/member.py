"""Running one ensemble member (EXPERIMENTAL).

This is a *wrapper*, not a second runner.  It calls exactly the
functions ``woof.runtime.run_experiment`` calls for a single-domain
experiment, in the same order, and adds one seam between preparation and
integration where the perturbation hook sees the initial state:

    quarantine -> catalog -> prepare ->[perturb]->[re-diagnose]-> integrate

The integration loop, the physics, and the I/O are untouched.

The ``[re-diagnose]`` step is the perturbation contract's caller
post-condition, not an optimisation.  ``state.p``, ``state.al`` and
``state.alt`` are diagnostics of ``(thp, php, mup, qv)``; a hook that
perturbs theta or moisture leaves them describing the state *before* the
perturbation.  ``woof.da.perturb`` cannot refresh them itself -- the
diagnostic path is CUDA-first and importing it would make a NumPy-backed
perturbation impossible -- so it records the requirement in
``provenance["post_conditions"]`` and hands it to whoever calls it.  That
is this module.

Multi-domain experiments are refused here rather than half-supported:
the perturbation seam for a domain tree has to decide what a member
perturbation means on nests, and that decision is not this lane's.

**A restart leg is not perturbed, and its baseline is its checkpoint --
the whole baseline, hash AND clock.**  ``restore_restart`` runs inside
the integrator and overwrites the whole prepared state, so anything this
seam wrote first is discarded.  A cycling leg therefore skips the hook
outright, records ``initial_state_sha256`` as the sha of the checkpoint
it restored, and compares its final state AND its final clock to that
checkpoint's -- the four facts that were previously all about a state the
leg never integrated.  Reading the clock baseline off the prepared state
was the residual half of that bug: a no-op integrator then reported a
successful 60 s advance with a prepared clock that never moved.
