"""Resolving the perturbation hook by provenance reference (EXPERIMENTAL).

The initial-condition perturbations themselves are another lane's work
and live in ``woof.da.perturb`` behind::

    apply_perturbations(state, seed, cfg)

This module resolves a provenance string from ``[ensemble] perturbation``
to a callable with that signature and records what it resolved to, so a
member's manifest entry always says which code perturbed it.

Three references are accepted:

``none``
    No perturbation.  Members differ only in what the model itself
    derives from the seed.  Useful for proving the engine's plumbing.
``experimental-stub``
    The local stand-in below.  It is *not* science: it adds seeded
    Gaussian noise to one named field and says so in provenance.
``woof.da.perturb``
    The real hook.  If the module or its entry point is absent the
    resolution fails closed rather than quietly degrading to the stub --
    an ensemble that believes it was perturbed and was not is worse than
    one that refuses to start.
