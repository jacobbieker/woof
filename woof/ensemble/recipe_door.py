"""The front door for source-trajectory and seeded surface-state ensemble members.

``woof ensemble CONFIG --recipe time-lagged`` (and ``go`` and ``run``, or
``[ensemble] recipe`` in the config) lands here.  The door owns no model
code and no preparation code:

* the member plan is :func:`woof.ensemble.recipes.build_recipe`, the same
  plan ``python -m woof.ensemble.recipes`` prints;
* each member's source trajectory is fetched and prepared by the ordinary
  preparation chain its source already has
  (:func:`woof.regional_preparation.preparation_chains`), from a copy of
  the config whose ``[fetch]`` table names that trajectory;
* the members run through the existing ensemble session
  (:class:`woof.ensemble.production.PreparedEnsembleSession`), which is
  handed each member's own prepared inputs.

Everything a request can be refused for is decided before the run folder
is claimed and before the first member is fetched: the member plan, every
member's own config and chain plan, and the gates the ordinary door asks
(the card, the memory envelope, the geography tree, the renderer, the
products and the disk).  ``--dry-run`` stops after the plan and the member
configs, and spends nothing.

A source recipe member is a real source trajectory. Surface-state recipes
share their unchanged source preparation and apply named, seeded GPU
perturbations independently after each member's ordinary initialization.
Named member rosters share each matching prepared authority and keep
different land selectors and soil layouts in separately bound banks.
