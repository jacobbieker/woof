"""The cycling skeleton and its assimilation seam (EXPERIMENTAL).

A cycle is: run every member forward to T, stop, then let an
assimilation step rewrite each member's state before the next leg.  This
module owns the first and third parts.  The second -- the actual
assimilation -- is a callable the caller supplies:

    assimilate(cycle_index, member_states) -> {member_index: {field: ndarray}}

``member_states`` gives, per member, the path of the state the leg
finished on.  The returned increments are applied through
``woof.ensemble.increments``, which is the only code allowed to write
them, and every application is receipted into the cycle manifest.

No assimilation method ships here, and none is implied.  The engine's
contribution is that the seam exists, is atomic, and is provenanced.

**The leg horizon is cumulative, because the integrator's is.**
``woof.runtime.integrate_prepared_case`` defines ``run_seconds`` as the
total forecast length from the experiment's own ``start_time``, and a
restart resumes at the checkpoint's elapsed time and runs *to* that
total.  Passing the leg duration made every leg after the first ask the
integrator to reach a horizon it was already standing on, which it
correctly refused: ``restart file is already at 60.0 s; nothing to
integrate before run_seconds=60.0``.  Leg ``N`` restarting from an
analysis therefore runs to ``(N+1) * cycle_seconds``; a leg that
re-prepares from the base config starts at zero and runs
``cycle_seconds``.  Where a restart states its own elapsed time, the
driver checks it is the ``N * cycle_seconds`` the timeline claims and
refuses a leg that would silently re-integrate or skip an interval.

**The analysis decision survives the outer completion write.** Every member
is staged before an immutable intent binds its full-file digest, input
context and complete prospective assimilation receipt. Recovery checks the
whole set before any remaining rename and publishes an immutable commit
receipt. Both records remain available after completion, so losing the
outer DONE write cannot invoke assimilation again.

The run compares its current member, method, policy and input identities
before recovering a decision. A reader verifies every recorded input and
analysis file before returning a roster. A corrupt or conflicting record
cannot be repaired by silently recomputing over a committed analysis.

**The consumer contract, stated rather than implied.**
:func:`read_analysis_roster` is the ONLY supported way to observe a
leg's analyses.  It settles the transaction first and then reports the
roster, so what it returns is every member's analysis or a refusal.

Listing a leg directory yourself is NOT supported and never was.  Phase
three is N renames; between the first and the last, ``ls`` shows a
roster that is real, incomplete, and indistinguishable by inspection
from a leg that genuinely analysed some members -- which is exactly the
state the marker exists to make legible and exactly the state a raw scan
cannot see.  The marker is beside the analyses in the same directory,
and reading one without the other is reading half the record.  This is a
deliberate choice of contract over mechanism: a generation pointer or a
directory commit would let a raw observer be right, and would replace
one rename per member with a scheme whose failure modes are less
obvious.  Every consumer in this tree goes through the recovering
reader, and ``tests/test_ensemble_hardening.py`` fails if a new one does
not.

The cycle record for a leg is *replaced* rather than appended to, and
carries an ``attempt`` counter, so a crash during assimilation and a
retry produce one entry describing two attempts rather than two entries
describing one cycle.

**Positivity is the driver's, because the filter refused it.**
``woof.da.letkf.analyze`` returns increments and deliberately does not
clip them: a Gaussian filter on a bounded, zero-inflated variable will
propose negative mixing ratios, and clip/transform/reject are not
equivalent choices.  This driver is the caller, so this driver chooses --
``positivity="clip"`` by default, with the counts and the mass the clip
*added* recorded per member in the assimilation receipt.  Set
``positivity="none"`` to state the choice the other way; see
:mod:`woof.da.positivity` for why anamorphosis is not on offer here.

    one registered scheme carries them, and an ambiguous structure is now

    """``{member index: analysis path}`` for one leg.  The supported reader.

    This is the ONLY supported way to observe a leg's analyses, and it is
    the reason the publication contract can be stated at all.  It settles
    the leg's transaction before it looks at anything
    (:func:`recover_analysis_publication`), so the roster it returns is
    one of exactly three things:

    * every member's ``analysis.npz``, when the leg assimilated;
    * ``{}``, when the leg was forecast-only and produced none;
    * a refusal, when the members on disk are neither -- either because a
      publication cannot be completed from what survived, or because some
      members have an analysis and others do not with no transaction in
      flight to explain it.

    It never returns the middle of a publication, because there is no
    longer a middle by the time it looks.

    **Scanning the directory instead is out of contract.**  Phase three
    renames N staged files into place one at a time; a raw listing taken
    between the first and the last is a real, incomplete roster that
    looks exactly like a leg which genuinely analysed some members.  The
    marker beside them says which it is, and this function is what reads
    both together.

    ``n_members`` is the authoritative roster the caller expects.  It is
    required: deriving ensemble size from the same directory being checked
    would let a missing member redefine a partial roster as complete.

    It is also **checked, and falsified against the leg**.  Requiring a
    count is not the same as believing one, and re-verification #5 measured
    the difference: ``n_members=0`` and ``n_members=-1`` returned ``{}`` on
    a fully analysed leg, which :func:`_analysis_restarts` reads as
    forecast-only and which silently discards every analysis; ``True``
    returned a one-member roster; ``2.9`` truncated; and ``2`` against three
    analysed member directories returned two of them and called it one
    ensemble.  So the count must be a positive non-boolean ``int``
    (:func:`_checked_member_count`), and it must agree with the member
    directories the leg carries (:func:`_member_directory_indices`) --
    otherwise this refuses, naming both numbers, rather than returning a
    roster measured with the wrong ruler.

    Independent proof that a caller's count came from authoritative
    metadata is not on offer and is not needed for that: the leg's own
    directories are enough to falsify a wrong one.  The one case they
    cannot speak to is a leg root that is not a directory at all, which
    carries no analyses to discard and still reads as ``{}``.
