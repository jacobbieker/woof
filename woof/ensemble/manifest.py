"""Ensemble and DA-cycle manifests (EXPERIMENTAL).

Two versioned schemas, both written with tmp+replace so a manifest is
never observed half-written -- a crash between members must leave the
previous complete manifest in place, not a truncated one.

``gpuwm-ensemble-manifest.v1`` lives at ``ens_root/ensemble-manifest.json``
and records, per member: the derived seed, the perturbation provenance,
the final state sha256, and the status.

``gpuwm-da-cycle-manifest.v1`` lives at ``ens_root/da-cycle-manifest.json``
and records the cycle times, the per-cycle per-member state shas, and a
slot for assimilation provenance that the DA lane fills in.
