"""Every member of an N > 1 ensemble runs its own inputs, or the request is refused.

Breakage this module prevents: a door that prepares one trajectory and is
asked for N members hands every member the same prepared inputs.  The run
is N copies of one forecast, and its spread maps (zero everywhere) and
probability maps (0 or 1) are published as an ensemble forecast.

A plain member count (``--members N`` or ``[ensemble] members = N`` with no
recipe) therefore means the automatic choice of
:func:`woof.ensemble.recipes.build_recipe`: the operational ensemble the
source's adapter row declares.  The doors that fetch run it through the
recipe door like any named recipe.  Where the adapter table declares no
runnable ensemble, and at the doors that hold one input, the request is
refused by name with the remedy, before anything is downloaded.

No source is named here.  The adapter table decides.
