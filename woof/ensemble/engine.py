"""Sequential member orchestration with resume (EXPERIMENTAL).

Members run one at a time -- one member resident in VRAM -- and the
manifest is republished atomically after every state change, so the
answer to "where did it get to" is always a complete file on disk.

Three rules the engine enforces and the tests pin:

* a member's seed is ``member_seed(base_seed, index)`` and nothing else;
* a member already recorded ``DONE`` is *refused*, not silently redone --
  rerunning it would overwrite the output another cycle may already
  have hashed;
* resume starts at the first member that is not ``DONE`` and leaves the
  finished ones alone.
