"""The frame inventory that binds a member record to its wrfout bytes.

A member record used to say ``wrfout_count: 1``, and that is the whole of
what any consumer could check.  ``woof enprod --accept-status FAILED``
did check it -- and a stale wrfout from an unrelated earlier attempt,
sitting under the member directory in place of the one the writer
produced, satisfies it exactly.  One file was declared; one file was
found; the product rendered, the graphic was stamped as an override, and
the bytes in the mean were not the bytes the run wrote.

A count is not an identity.  This module defines the one that is:

    path      -- canonical POSIX-spelled path RELATIVE to the member
                 directory, so the inventory survives the ensemble being
                 moved and cannot name anything outside the member;
    domain    -- the ``dNN`` token the filename carries, so a d02 file
                 cannot answer for a d03 one;
    frames    -- every valid time in the file WITH its frame index, in
                 file order, because "which frame is 18:00Z" is the
                 question the product suite actually asks;
    size      -- the byte length, a free first-order check;
    sha256    -- the content hash, which is the part a stale replacement
                 cannot forge.

The contract is versioned (:data:`WRFOUT_INVENTORY_CONTRACT`) and both
halves import it from here: :mod:`woof.ensemble.engine` records it when a
member finishes, :func:`woof.da.enprod.verify_override_inventory` binds
against it before a widened roster draws anything.  Two spellings of one
contract is how the count check drifted into meaninglessness in the first
place.

**Cost, stated rather than hidden.**  Hashing means reading every wrfout
back once after the run wrote it.  At a few GB per member that is seconds,
not minutes, and it buys the only check that distinguishes the file the
run produced from a file of the same size in the same place.
