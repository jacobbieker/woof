"""One schema validator for the sealed-runtime manifest, and one answer
to "how does THIS install know what it is".

Two things used to be decided independently in six places each, and both
cost a field user a run.

**The manifest.**  ``WOOF_NATIVE_DISTRIBUTION_MANIFEST`` names the
``gpuwm-native-wrf-runtime-v1`` document a sealed runtime archive writes
beside its artifacts.  Every consumer validated the part it was about to
read and no more: the identity helper checked ``schema``/``status``/
``artifact.gpuwm_version``/``source.worktree_clean``, the preprocessing
selector checked ``contract.platform.backends``, the decoder binder
checked ``payload``.  A hand-authored minimal manifest therefore passed
the first gate, ran a preparation for several minutes, and died at the
third with "sealed native distribution has no valid preprocessing
backend inventory" -- a true sentence about a document that was already
invalid when the run started.  :func:`validate_manifest` is the whole
required schema in one place, and it names EVERY defect at once, so a
manifest is accepted or refused before any work begins.

**The identity.**  A run's provenance receipt asks the same question a
manifest answers, for installs that have no manifest.  The old answer
was ``git rev-parse`` with the working directory set to the directory
containing the ``woof`` package -- which is a checkout for a developer
and ``site-packages`` for everyone else.  On every pip install that is
``CalledProcessError: returned non-zero exit status 128``, and on a venv
nested inside some unrelated repository it is worse: it succeeds and
binds a stranger's commit.  :func:`provenance` resolves the real cases
in order -- sealed manifest, genuine checkout of THIS tree, an editable
install's source tree (by git, or by its content when it has no
``.git``), installed wheel -- and the wheel case is answered from the
distribution metadata and its ``RECORD`` digests, which is exactly the
identity pip installed.

Nothing here imports numpy, cupy, or any ingest module: ``woof doctor``
runs it on a base install to report which path an install has *before*
anything else runs.

    An extracted source archive installed with ``pip install -e .`` has

    it.  The identity is the SHA-256 over every listed file's current

    stay ``None``: no commit is claimed.  A listed file that is gone is
    recorded as missing rather than refused, the way ``git status``
    records a deletion.

    Reading 3,000 files costs seconds, so each digest is remembered
    against the file's size, modification time, change time and inode in
    ``~/.woof/cache/source-content``.  A later call re-reads only files
    whose stat moved, which is how git keeps ``git status`` cheap, and a
    file written within :data:`_CONTENT_RACY_NS` of its read is never
    remembered.  Returns ``None`` when ``root`` is a checkout (git
