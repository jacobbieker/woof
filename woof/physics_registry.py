#:
#: A plan is portable: the same document is valid on the laptop that
#: authored it and on the node that runs it, and that is the property
#: ``launchable`` states.  Whether a 225 MB dataset or a table set is
#: INSTALLED HERE is a different question with a different answer per
#: machine, and it is answered by the door that is about to load the
#: scheme -- Thompson's staging preflight and loader for a table set,
#: :func:`woof.config.validate_experiment_preparation` for the aerosol
#: lateral-forcing dataset -- each naming the member that is missing and
#: the command that stages it.
#:
#: So plan review REPORTS them, in ``install_state``, and leaves
#: ``launchable`` to the plan.  Appending them to ``errors`` instead made
#: a DEFAULT template unlaunchable on every fresh install, because two of
#: classic Thompson's four tables are excluded from the wheel and arrive
#: only through ``woof fetch-tables``: ``woof source
#: --validate-physics-plan`` exited nonzero on a correct plan, and the
#: shipped suites went red in exactly the state the clean-venv release
#: replay runs in.  Collecting the requirements and never resolving them
#: (which is what this replaced) is the opposite defect and is not
#: restored: the resolution is reported, with what is missing and where
#: it was looked for.

# ------------------------------------------------ physics identity (A153)
#: What a physics selection binds of this registry.
#:
#: The document digest (:func:`registry_sha256`) moves with every byte of
#: the document, and most of the document is prose: warnings, notes and
#: reasons that cite ``file:line`` and are re-pinned whenever the cited
#: code moves.  A selection receipt that bound the document digest refused
#: every earlier preparation as "physics selection differs" after a
#: citation-only commit, while the forecast it would have run was byte
#: identical (A153: the Shin-Hong ``kpbl < kte`` guard citation and the
#: LES ``km_opt`` header citations refused the default, NSSL, P3, KF,
#: Noah-MP and Shin-Hong selections across 2.8.0 -> 2.8.1).  It also bound
#: every OTHER scheme: a change to WDM6's restart identity refused a
#: Thompson preparation.
#:
#: So a selection binds the registry's physics PARTS it runs on, each with
#: its documentation and its admission rules removed and nothing else
#: removed:
#:
#: ``document``
#:     ``schema`` and ``registry_version``, the format the rest is read in.
#: ``components.<component>``
#:     every component's selector keys and per-domain selector rules,
#:     because they decide which option a configuration resolves to.
#: ``components.<component>.options.<option>``
#:     each SELECTED option: selectors, parameters (the option's own
#:     identity values, the Noah-MP ``opt_*`` and MYNN ``bl_mynn_*`` pins
#:     among them), the constraints the preflight cannot re-check (see
#:     :data:`REGISTRY_CONSTRAINTS_KEPT_IN_PHYSICS_IDENTITY`), implemented
#:     flag, reachability state, table assets and their SHA-256s, consumer
#:     rows (restart algorithm identity, callable class, moment and field
#:     inventories) and extensions.  This is where a changed option, table
#:     or kernel identity moves the digest.
#: ``parameters.<knob>``
#:     each IMPLEMENTED knob's type, default, bounds and enum, one part per
#:     knob so a refusal names the knob.  A default is read by any scheme
#:     whose configuration omits the knob, so a knob is in every
#:     selection's scope, except a knob the registry gives to one component
#:     (``component_id``) that only that component's unselected options
#:     read (see :func:`registry_knob_readers`).  A knob the registry
#:     declares but does not implement (:func:`parameter_is_implemented`)
#:     is no part: no configuration can set it, so it has no physics, and
#:     implementing it later is an addition to the parts.  A knob whose
#:     declaration says it is read only under other settings
#:     (``read_when``, see :func:`registry_knob_is_read`) is still a part,
#:     because which settings hold is a property of a configuration, not
#:     of the registry; it is the comparison against a preparation made
#:     before the knob existed that reads the condition.
#: ``transitions``
#:     the nest microphysics transitions.
#: ``templates.<profile>``
#:     the named profile's components and parameters, when a profile is
#:     named, less the entries at their off values (see
#:     :func:`registry_off_template`), since a template that states a
#:     component's off option or a knob's off value composes what one that
#:     omits it does.
#:
#: The receipt records one digest per part, so a refusal names the part
#: that changed.  v1 bound each option's constraints whole and the
#: parameters block as one part: a new PBL admitted beside GF and the MYNN
#: surface layer refused every 2.8.0 preparation of either, and a knob
#: added for one scheme refused every selection, naming only "parameters".
#: v2 bound every declared knob and every template entry: off-by-default
#: physics (an urban component whose ``none`` option every template names,
#: two knobs only its other options read, two radiation knobs implemented
#: at their off value) refused all 56 of 2.8.0's receipts by component,
#: knob and template, 54 of them for physics that runs only when selected.
#:
#: What a preparation's registry lacked is resolved by the comparison
#: (:func:`woof.physics_compat.physics_selection_differences`): a
#: component, option or knob this build added counts as equal when the
#: configuration resolves it to its off value (:func:`setting_off_value`,
#: :func:`component_off_option`), and is refused, named, when it does not.
#: What is outside the parts, by top-level block and why:
REGISTRY_PHYSICS_IDENTITY_SCHEMA = "gpuwm-physics-registry-parts-v3"

#: Top-level blocks no selection's physics identity binds.

        back to the registry's own declared default for that parameter, so
        a rule cannot be dodged by leaving the knob at its default.
    ``sources``
        ``[source_id, ...]`` -- the plan's ``context.source_id`` must be
        one of them (audit R-005).  A per-source incompatibility is a
        real thing -- native HRRR cannot retain its analyzed
        QC/QR/QI/QS/QG with microphysics off, and no radiation-only
        analyzed-cloud carrier is implemented -- and it was previously
        spelled only in prose inside a runner, where plan review never
        reached it and the run died in ``woof/ingest/real.py``.  It is a
        row now, so a source that gains such an incompatibility is table
        work.

    A rule MAY also carry the way out, in both halves:

    ``remedy_label``
        the sentence that names it, printed after ``reason`` wherever this
        refusal is shown, so the gate law's "and how to get out of it" is
        one string in one table rather than each door's own wording.
    ``remedy_settings``
        ``{setting: value}`` -- the smallest edit that clears the rule,
        machine-applicable.  A front end offering a repair applies this
        instead of parsing the prose for it, which is what
        woof/companion_physics.py used to do with a substring of one
        scheme's refusal.

    An empty rule fires on everything, which is never what anyone means,
    so it is treated as no rule at all rather than as an unconditional
    refusal.

    THE reason this is not :func:`resolve_asset_requirement`.  The dataset
    a domain with external lateral boundaries (``specified``) needs is
    located at run time by an ingest module with its own ordered ladder, and a second ladder written in
    registry data resolved DIFFERENTLY: the ingest ladder has a
    working-directory rung (WRF's own ``constants_name`` rule) and accepts
    any filename through its single-file environment override, while a
    generic asset ladder looks for the canonical filename inside the
    override's parent directory and never looks at the working directory.
    Two ladders over one dataset is how plan review says LAUNCHABLE about a
    file the run cannot find, so the row names its resolver
    (``module:function``) and the answer comes from there.

    THE PLAN CARRIES NO MACHINE PATH, and this used to pretend it did.
    The row named a ``path_setting`` (``wif_climatology_path``) and this
    function read it out of the plan's settings -- but that name is not in
    the registry's ``parameters`` and no runner route lists it in
    ``allowed_parameter_keys`` or ``allowed_expert_setting_keys``, so
    ``_parameter_error`` refuses any plan that spells it and the branch
    could not run.  A plan is portable and a filesystem path is not; the
    operator-named path is a RunConfig field, answered by the run door,
    and here the resolver is asked with no argument, which is exactly what
    the environment overrides and the working-directory rung are for. The
    owner's own named refusal is reported as an unresolved answer carrying
    that sentence, because plan review reports rather than raises.

    ``settings`` is still accepted so the deliberate-setting test and this
    resolution read one signature; nothing in it names a path.
