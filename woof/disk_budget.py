"""What a run will write to disk, projected before it starts.

A run's disk is the source files it downloads, the files its preparation
writes from them, its history files, its checkpoints and its rendered
pictures. History prices the writer's selected variable shapes and each
domain's output window. Checkpoints price their independent state inventory.
The pictures scale with the history frames, since each picture
has a fixed size in pixels, but its compressed size varies with the
product and horizontal grid. Checkpoint bytes per cell were read off the
files a real run wrote (see :data:`MEASURED`). The download and the
preparation are priced by :mod:`woof.download_budget` from sizes
measured on real downloads and preparations: an 18 hour HRRR run
downloads about 22 GB, more than its history, and an event page layout
projected without them wrote nearly twice its projection.  A preparation
that composes through the mapped engine also stages its decoded frame
stream in a scratch folder while it runs, sized by the SOURCE grid
(:func:`woof.download_budget.compose_scratch_estimate`): a GDPS 48 hour
window stages about 82 GB for any domain that reaches the globe's stored
longitude cut, and about 5 GB elsewhere, where the atmospheric window
crops its pressure levels.  The stream is gone before
the forecast writes its history, so the peak is the download and the
preparation plus the larger of the stream and what the forecast writes.

``woof run-plan`` refuses, before it downloads anything, a run whose
projection is larger than the free space on the disk that will hold it,
because such a run fills the disk partway and ends with nothing usable,
and it can stop other work on that disk.  ``woof downscale`` refuses a
child the same way before the child starts
(:func:`projected_child_bytes`).

    keeps every set).

    ``render_products`` is the child's complete product request, passed to
    the same measured product/grid model as a forecast. Its reported
    ``pictures_per_frame`` remains the renderer-catalog upper count.

    are rebuilt from the parent archive each time it runs), so a set costs
