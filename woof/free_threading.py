"""Rank threads that do not take turns: the free-threaded interpreter seam.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS, measured 2026-10-03 on the HRRR grid
(1797 x 1057 x 50, full HRRR physics): every ``[devices]`` rank steps its
own card from its own Python thread (:class:`tilestream.ranks.RankedRun`),
and on an ordinary CPython build those threads share one interpreter lock.
CuPy gives the lock up and takes it back around every CUDA call, so one
ordinary step costs each rank about 3,900 hand-offs and a radiation step
about 140,000.  The hand-offs do not shrink when a rank's slab does, so
adding cards adds lock traffic faster than it removes GPU work: on a
two-socket 4 x RTX PRO 6000 box the four rank threads used about 1.2 cores
between them, the cards sat 28-59 % busy, and four cards were slower than
two (333.8 against 257.9 s per forecast hour).  On one build, four cards
took 289 s per forecast hour under the lock (radiation steps 17-40 s) and
121 s without it (4.4 s), with byte-identical histories.

A free-threaded build (``python3.14t``, PEP 703) has no such lock and the
rank threads run at once.  It re-enables the lock the moment any extension
module that has not declared itself free-threading safe is imported, and
netCDF4 is one: :mod:`woof.io.wrfout` and :mod:`woof.core.rrtmgp` import
it, so without this module every rank would quietly go back to taking
turns.  The lock is not what keeps netCDF4 safe in this process: every
netCDF4 session runs under :data:`woof.io.netcdf_serialization.NETCDF4_IO_LOCK`
(netCDF4 releases the interpreter lock inside HDF5 anyway, which is why
that lock exists).  So a command-line run re-executes itself once with
``PYTHON_GIL=0`` before it imports anything heavy, and that import can no
longer serialize the ranks.  An explicit ``PYTHON_GIL`` in the environment
is always respected, including ``PYTHON_GIL=1`` to force the lock on.

Nothing here changes arithmetic: the same kernels run in the same order on
each card's streams, and cards still order against each other only through
CUDA events.  Byte identity across GIL and free-threaded runs is a measured
receipt, not an assumption (CHANGELOG 2.8.6).
