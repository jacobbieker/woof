"""Author a source-selected 12/3 km moving-nest setup from an explicit center.

The map request reads only the named source's published f000 MSLP and wind
fields. Configuration creation reuses the ordinary domain author, physics
suite and vortex tracker; neither entry point starts a forecast or computes a
new tracking algorithm.

WHICH SOURCE IS TABLE WORK, NOT A BRANCH HERE.  Every source-derived fact on
the emitted document -- the cycle grid, the forcing interval that prices the
tree road and stamps the WPS namelist, the coverage window, the member
grammar, the physics profile, the preparation recipe -- is read from that
source's own registry row through :mod:`woof.cyclone_sources`, which is the
one place the planable rows and the acquisition routes are intersected.

    floor admits on the nest it was written for, 40 parent cells wide.
    THE FLOOR STATES THE PHYSICS -- keep this much of the child, so at
    most the rest is strip the move exposes and the child has to spin up
    -- and the maximums are the derived half, at whatever size the nest
    ends up.  Overlap is separable, so the binding case is the DIAGONAL
    move, where both factors shrink at once: with the nest ``N`` parent
    cells wide, a floor ``f`` admits a per-axis magnitude ``m`` only
    while ``(1 - m/N)**2 >= f``, that is ``m <= N * (1 - sqrt(f))``.
    :func:`woof.core.nest_relocation.max_parent_cells_for_overlap` is
    that bound, and it is the same one ``check_admissible`` enforces at
    run time, so the door cannot emit a maximum the run then refuses.

    BOTH ROADS COME THROUGH HERE, which is the point of there being one
    of these.  The reduction ladder proposes a nest SMALLER than the
    preset's and the same floor admits fewer parent cells on it, so
    copying the preset's numbers down writes back exactly the
    contradiction the preset was corrected to remove: a maximum the move
    can pass and the floor then refuses, which ends a forecast at its
    first relocation cadence instead of moving it as far as it was
    allowed.  A nest grown to ``--nest-budget-gib`` is WIDER, and the
    same floor admits more there; holding it at the preset's number
    would have a 240x240 nest move no further per cadence than a
    160x160 one on a card that paid for the difference.  The bound
    holds before it steps up, because the preset's own 6 is the floor
    of a 40-cell nest: 42 cells still admit 6, 44 admit 7, 50 admit 8;
    the first step up buys ground without buying reach.

    The search margin is the preset's own PROPORTION of the nest -- half
    its width in parent cells -- and never under the preset's 20, so the
    tracker's box grows with a grown nest and the reduction ladder emits
    the margin its configuration declares.

    Both emitted tables (the configuration's ``[domain.follow]`` and the
    cyclone.json receipt) come through here, so the file the run reads
    and the document the desktop reads carry one number.  So does
    :func:`_nest_clearance_cells`, which is why the ladder is priced with
    the bounds each rung would actually carry.

    """Why the preset nest cannot be had here, naming what actually bound it.

    TWO DIFFERENT BREAKAGES REACH THIS SENTENCE and they do not have the
    same way out.  ``budget_bound`` is the answer :func:`_budget_sizing`
    already computed a hundred lines above: ``request`` means the named
    budget is the smaller of the two numbers and raising it moves the
    wall; ``card`` means the card's own free memory is, the named budget
    is larger than anything this machine could offer, and raising it
    moves nothing.  Saying "raise --nest-budget-gib" to a caller who
    asked for 24 GiB on a 6 GB card names a remedy that cannot work and
    blames a number that did not refuse, and a form reading ``bound_by``
    is told the caller's own budget refused a run the card refused.  The
    card-bound reader's way through is to drop the flag, and that is a
    layout this door measures rather than a mode it suggests.

    The floor is the shipped quick-start's own nest, so the sentence
    names it in both units a reader has -- cells and the parent cells it
    registers on -- and what it actually costs on this card, measured by
    the same estimator that refused it rather than asserted.

    WHAT THE FLOOR IS COMPARED AGAINST IS THE BUDGET, the same number the
    door compares the preset against without the flag
    (:func:`_admitted_as_requested`), because the floor IS that layout.
    It was the fit target -- the budget less ``fit_headroom_bytes`` --
    while the flagless door used the budget, so on the band between the
    two (5.25 to 5.475 GiB free on a 6 GiB card at the 1.13 margin) this
    sentence said the card could not hold the preset nest and named a
    smaller layout as the way out, and dropping the flag authored the
    whole preset unchanged (A175).  Quoting the budget is safe from the
    contradiction the fit target was once introduced to cure: that one
    printed the budget while comparing against the target, so the
    printed number sat above the price; here the printed number is the
    one compared, so a floor the flat road refuses on card memory prices
    above it.

    AND THE BUDGET IS ONLY THE FLAT ROAD'S BOUND.  On the DEFAULT
    ``--tiles auto`` the tree walk withholds the following nest's rebuild
    transient before it compares anything, so it refuses against a
    SMALLER budget, and quoting the flat number there prints a figure
    above the price beside a sentence saying the price did not fit -- at
    a 5.06 GiB budget the flat road's number was 5,161,476,948 bytes
    against a 5,141,378,237 byte price, and the number that bound was
    5,139,501,921.  ``fit_bound`` (:func:`_tile_road_bound`) is that
    number where the tile road is what refused, and it is quoted in place
    of the flat one whenever the two differ, with the withholding that
    produced it and the walk's own way out beside it.  The way out is
    re-aimed with it: "raise --nest-budget-gib until it clears what the
    floor prices" is false advice on that road, where the flat number
    already cleared the price and the run was refused anyway.

    ``requested_bytes`` is what the caller asked for and is required on
    the card-bound branch, which states it.  It once had a ``None`` arm
    that left that clause out and started the next one lowercase ("...
    against {target}. the card is the bound"); no call site ever took it,
    so the arm is gone rather than being given a sentence of its own.
