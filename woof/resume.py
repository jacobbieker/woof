"""``woof resume`` -- continue a run from its newest valid checkpoint.

Thin sugar over the proven restart machinery: this module only LOCATES a
checkpoint.  Everything that makes a resume safe -- the manifest-valid
member proof, the config/setup/physics identity checks, the complete
tree-set refusal -- already lives in :mod:`woof.io.restart` and
:mod:`woof.supervisor` and runs unchanged when the located path is
handed to the ordinary ``run --restart`` dispatch.  Nothing here relaxes
a refusal; an invalid NEWEST checkpoint is skipped with a printed reason
and the next-newest valid one is taken, which is exactly what an
operator does by hand after a crash mid-write.

Checkpoint naming (``woof.io.restart.restart_filename`` and
``write_tree_restart``): ``gpuwmrst_d0X_YYYY-MM-DD_HH_MM_SS.npz`` for a
single domain, with a ``__<checkpoint_set_id>`` member suffix for tree
sets.  A SET is every file sharing one instant + set id; its handle is
the lowest grid id (the root), which is the path ``restore_tree_restart``
expects.

    history, the lateral boundary tendencies built from those frames on

    ``woof downscale`` carries no continuation flag either, so a child
    is re-run rather than continued.

    The way out depends on what the directory holds, and the reading
    that decides it is the report's VERDICT, never the report's
    existence: a child publishes one at its last frame and also at the
    health check that finds its fields non-finite.  A child whose

    the pictures: the render line goes first.  A child that stopped
