"""``woof mesh``: make an MPAS mesh at the resolution you ask for.

The generator itself is ``rw_mpas_mesh``, a binary in
``tools/rustwx/crates/rw-mpas`` that reproduces the published NCAR
meshes to 1e-11 or better.  Until this module existed it was
engine-proven and unreachable: no row in
:data:`woof.bridge_assets.BUNDLED_ARTIFACTS`, no contract marker, no
environment variable, no resolver, and no Python that called it.  A
capability with no front door is not a feature, so this file is the
door and the three legs behind it -- resolution, sizing, and the
quality gate.

What the door is for
--------------------
A user says four things: WHERE to refine, HOW FINE there, HOW COARSE
everywhere else, and WHICH CARD it has to run on.  ``woof mesh``
turns that into a resolution spec, sizes it against the measured
footprint of the named card, checks the result is not rougher than
anything that has been integrated, and drives the binary::

    woof mesh --out kansas.grid.nc \\
        --refine 39.0,-98.0,1200,15 --background-km 120 --card rtx-5090

Regions are DATA.  A second place to refine is a second ``--refine``
row and a second element of ``regions`` in the spec the binary reads;
adding one touches no code here and no code in the crate.  That is the
arbitrary acceptance test at this door.

Sizing is CARD-SPECIFIC, and that is not a detail
-------------------------------------------------
The device footprint model is ``fixed_mib + cells * bytes_per_cell``,
and the fixed term is DERIVED per card rather than stored.  Most of it
is one allocation: the CUDA per-context local-memory backing store,
which the driver sizes for the widest launched kernel frame at full
residency -- ``(frame_bytes - 1024) * SMs * maxThreadsPerSM`` -- and
never gives back.  Two of those three factors are properties of the
PART, so identical code pays 7,032.4 MiB on a 170 SM card and
2,895.7 MiB on a 70 SM one, and the measured fixed terms come out
9,798 MiB and 5,384 MiB.  A fixed term quoted without naming the card
is meaningless, and using one card's number for another mis-sizes the
request by thousands of MiB.

What is NOT derived is the remainder -- context, module images, driver
scratch.  That is measured per card as ``local_store_residue_mib``, it
is not the same on the two parts measured (2,765.6 against 2,488.3 MiB)
and it does not scale with the SM count, so it cannot be predicted for
a part nobody has run.

So the model is a TABLE (:data:`SIZING_DATA_PATH`) with one row per
card, each row carrying the card's SM count, its resident-thread
capacity, its measured residue and its anchors, and a card with no
measured row is REFUSED by name rather than answered with a
neighbour's number.  Measuring a new card is a row.

The binary carries the same model, per card, behind ``--card``, and
refuses ``--vram-gib`` without one.  This door still computes the cell
count itself and passes ``--cells``, so the two never disagree
silently; :func:`woof.mpas_mesh.SIZING_DATA_PATH`'s numbers and the
crate's ``mesh::footprint::CARDS`` are the same measurements.

The quality gate
----------------
A mesh can be generated far rougher than anything NCAR publishes: a
15 km regional patch inside a 10 GiB budget needs a spacing ratio of 12
and reaches 4.88 %/cell at its steepest, against 1.53 %/cell in the
production ``x4.163842``.  Whether the dycore is stable there is NOT
MEASURED.  The bound is therefore a PROVISIONAL row in the same table,
with the evidence field saying so in those words, and it moves when a
dycore run sets it -- by editing the table, not the code.

The deliverable boundary
------------------------
This produces a PAIR: the grid file, and beside it the matching STATIC
(terrain, land use, soil, ``nVertLevels=55``, ``nSoilLevels=4``, an
FP32-bit-exact ``nominalMinDc``, and ``deriv_two``).  Both, because the
mesh registry pins the two together by byte count and SHA-256 and a
grid alone reaches no dycore.

This paragraph used to say the door produced a grid and left the static
to somebody else, which was true when it was written and stopped being
true twice: once when ``rw_mpas_static`` was built, and again when that
engine started writing ``deriv_two``.  The verdict a run gets is
therefore COMPUTED from the engine's own absent-field list
(:func:`runnability_verdict`) rather than asserted in prose, so a
sentence like this one cannot outlive what it describes a second time.
