"""``woof branch`` -- seed a NEW run from an existing checkpoint.

``woof resume`` continues the run that wrote the checkpoint: same
config, same output directory, one trajectory.  A what-if is the other
question -- *what would this forecast have done from hour N with the
tracker widened / a trimmed history tape?* -- and answering it means a
SECOND run that starts from the first run's state and writes somewhere
else entirely.

A subcommand rather than ``resume --branch`` because the two doors
disagree about the one word they share: ``resume --outdir`` names the
directory being CONTINUED, and a branch's ``--outdir`` has to name the
directory being CREATED (as it does on ``run``, ``go`` and every other
door in this CLI).  Folding them would have made ``--outdir`` mean the
source in one mode and the destination in the other, which is the kind
of flag nobody can read twice the same way.  ``--from-run`` names the
source instead, and checkpoint LOCATION is shared code
(:func:`woof.resume.resolve_resume_checkpoint`), not a second
implementation.

**What may change, and who decides.**  Not this module.  The restart
contract already publishes the split -- ``woof.core.model``'s
``RESTART_TOLERATED_*`` tables are what ``restart_identity_payload``
strips before the fingerprint is taken, i.e. exactly the settings a
checkpoint does not bind -- so the changeable set here is DERIVED from
those tables.  A branch that let anything else through would not be
refused by this door; it would be refused by the restart guard at
restore time, after the fetch, the static build and the device
allocation.  Refusing here, by name, with the reason, is the same
refusal moved to where it costs nothing.

The three things the door guarantees, in order:

1. every setting is classified before anything is created, so a refused
   branch leaves no directory behind (the poisoned-``--out`` shape);
2. the branched config's restart identity payload is compared against
   the parent's and must be byte-identical -- the name table is the
   fast path, this is the proof;
3. the source run is opened read-only.  Nothing is written outside the
   new run directory, which must be empty and must not be inside the
   run being branched from.
