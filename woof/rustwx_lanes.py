"""Locate and drive ``rw_ensbatch`` and ``rw_obsgrid``.

The render law says weather-field product plots come from the real Rust
renderer.  Two families of weather field had no Rust renderer to come
from, so three modules in this tree drew them with matplotlib and said so
in their own docstrings:

* **ensemble products** -- ``woof/da/enprod.py``: *"the vendored rust
  renderer's catalog has no ensemble entries ... there is no second
  engine to switch to"*;
* **gridded radar observations** -- ``tools/da_level2_render.py`` and
  ``tools/da_nowcast_render.py``, which already borrow the Rust
  renderer's assets and palette while re-implementing its fill in
  matplotlib.  Both now carry ``--engine`` and resolve it through the one
  :func:`resolve_obsgrid_engine`.  ``da_level2_render`` DRIVES
  ``rw_obsgrid`` for the five single-panel products and names the reason
  in one sentence when it falls back instead.  ``da_nowcast_render``
  composes its sheets itself and drives no engine yet, so it prints the
  DEPRECATED FALLBACK sentence every run and adds the resolution reason
  beside it when there is one.  What keeps their own figures is the
  SHAPE, not the science: three of the four are side-by-side or
  per-radar GRIDS of panels and the engine composes one, so the sheets
  stay until there is a compositor to tile the engine's PNGs with.

``rw_ensbatch`` and ``rw_obsgrid`` are those two engines.  This module is
the seam the three callers reach them through, built exactly like
:mod:`woof.rustwx` and :mod:`woof.rustwx_fetch`: the same five-rung
resolution ladder, the same ``--abi`` contract handshake (a binary that
launches is not a binary that speaks your grammar), the same
event-line parsing.

Neither binary is a replacement for ``rw_wrfbatch``: its
one-positional-wrfout contract is untouched, and a caller with one
deterministic run still drives it.  What these add is the two input
shapes that contract cannot express -- N members at ONE valid time, and
a file of observations that is not a forecast.
