"""What every front door does with :mod:`woof.provenance`: say it, or refuse.

:mod:`woof.provenance` answers *which tree is executing*.  It judges
nothing and prints nothing, deliberately -- it is the instrument.  This
module is the POLICY built on it, and it is exactly three sentences
long:

1. **Announce.**  Every front door prints the one-line form at start and
   records :func:`receipt_block` in whatever receipt it already writes.
   A run whose output nobody can trace to a tree is how this project
   spent eight days executing a branch that had diverged 2,370 commits
   earlier with nothing anywhere announcing it.

2. **Refuse a version that contradicts its own source.**  Two numbers
   describing one tree that disagree is not a cosmetic defect: it is the
   shape of "a user reports plots labelled 1.6.2 while believing they
   installed 1.8", and nothing in the product could adjudicate it.
   :func:`version_identity_refusal`.

3. **Refuse a renderer bridge this tree did not build and did not ask
   for.**  :func:`renderer_bridge_refusal`, which is the real fix for
   the bridge being gated on EXISTENCE: ``rustwx.find_renderer()``
   returns the first candidate that is a file, and its last candidate is
   the shared staging directory ``~/.woof/bridges`` -- which belongs to
   no tree at all.  Measured on the reference box while this was
   written: a worktree at ``faa1ce286db8`` (1.8.7) with no local build
   resolved the shared staging copy of ``rw_wrfbatch.exe``, whose
   embedded ``GPUWM_BRIDGE_SOURCE_REV`` is ``6a3cbaaf051a`` -- the
   1.6.0 release-prep commit.  Three minor releases of product catalog
   silently substituted into a 1.8.7 run, which is how a render produced
   153 products where the matching engine produced 168.

WHAT MUST NOT REFUSE
--------------------
A refusal that fires on a normal install is worse than the defect it
guards, so every gate here is written to be *unanswerable-means-silent*:

* A plain ``pip install recast-woof`` wheel: its code and its metadata were
  written together by pip, so the version question has one answer and
  cannot disagree; it has no git anywhere, no vendored Rust workspace,
  and its renderer can only ever come from the staging directory.  Both
  gates pass without printing a word.
* A source tree nobody installed: ``woof.__version__`` accurately reports
  ``0+unknown``, and an accurate "I do not know" is not a contradicting
  claim.  No refusal.
* A checkout whose renderer is built in its own ``tools/rustwx/target``:
  the binary is inside the executing tree by construction.  No refusal,
  and no bytes are read to establish it.
* A checkout that NAMES its renderer through ``WOOF_RW_WRFBATCH``:
  explicit configuration is a declaration.  The verdict is recorded in
  the receipt; nothing is refused.

Only the silent fall-through refuses -- the case where nobody chose the
binary that ran.

The refusals are composed with :func:`woof.explain.layered` and raised
as ``ValueError``, which is the convention every front door in this
package already prints as one sentence at exit 2 (see
``woof.cli.main``'s refusal boundary).  The voice is the
nocturnal-radiation guard's: name what was refused, name the remedy, and
put the mechanism in the ``--explain`` half.

       existing proof of "built from this commit" -- the release cut
