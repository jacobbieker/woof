"""Where a declared source path actually lives in THIS interpreter.

The wheel-reach defect.  Two gates in this program digest the port's own modules by
name -- the regional kernel set in
:mod:`woof.hex.cuda_backend.regional_admission`, and the 23-module frozen
execution set in ``src/hexcore/drivers/run_cuda_v841_full_physics_x4.py``.  Both spell
their members the way the repository does, ``src/hexcore/<module>.py``,
and both used to resolve that spelling by walking up from a file and
assuming a checkout underneath.

**The concrete breakage that assumption caused**, measured on two machines
before this module existed (``evidence/xmachine-20260827`` section 6b,
``evidence/wheel-reach-20260827``): from an installed wheel the walk lands
on ``<venv>/Lib`` or ``<venv>/lib/python3.13``, no ``src/`` exists beneath
it, and the regional digest refuses every limited-area run with *"the
regional kernel set cannot be digested"*.  0.2.0's headline capability was
therefore unreachable from a wheel on every machine, with no flag that
could open it -- ``--repo`` was never consulted by either gate and no
caller passed a root.

**The rule this module installs, and it is one rule rather than two.**  A
declared name under ``src/hexcore/`` is resolved against the ``woof.hex``
package THIS INTERPRETER IMPORTED, wherever that is.  In a source checkout
that is ``<tree>/src/hexcore`` and the resolution is byte-for-byte what
it always was, so no digest moves and no anchor lapses.  From a wheel it is
``site-packages/hexcore`` -- the copy that will actually execute.

That second half is the part worth saying plainly: resolving against the
EXECUTING package is not a workaround for the wheel case, it is the
correct question in every case.  A gate that hashes a checkout's copy of a
module while the interpreter runs a different copy is reporting on bytes
that will not be launched.  The hybrid shape a wheel user is currently
told to assemble -- ``pip install woof hex`` for the package plus
``--repo <checkout>/tree`` for the drivers ``tools/`` holds -- is exactly
that shape, and both gates were silently on the wrong side of it.

The declared NAME follows the repository, and it is never rewritten for the
sake of a digest.  Both digests frame name-then-payload, so a resolution
change with the same bytes under it produces an identical digest, while a
NAME change moves every digest keyed to it even when no arithmetic moved.

0.2.0 moved every name once, and deliberately: the package was renamed from
``mpas_port`` to ``woof.hex``, so the prefix below went with it.  That is
what a name-framed digest costs -- the whole table lapses and has to be
re-derived on the card that earned it -- and the alternative, keeping a
retired directory name in the declaration so the arithmetic would not
notice, is a gate reporting on a path nothing executes.  The names say what
the repository says.
