"""The machine a receipt was written on, named without naming it.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS: every door receipt recorded ``platform.node()``,
the machine's network name, so a receipt a user shares -- attached to a bug
report, published beside a figure -- carried the name of their machine.  A
receipt still has to say whether two runs came from the same machine, which
is what the field was for, so it records a salted digest of the name instead.

The salt is random and per user: it lives in ``~/.woof/hex-host-salt``,
written once, so one user's receipts agree with each other across runs and
cannot be matched to a machine name by hashing a dictionary of likely names.
Where that file cannot be read or written, the salt is random for this
process and the record says so (``"scope": "run"``), which still names no
machine.
