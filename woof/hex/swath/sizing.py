"""Pricing a placement through the generator itself, before anything is built.

``rw_mpas_mesh --dry-run`` sizes a resolution spec on the CPU, writes
nothing and needs no card.  That is the whole reason this module exists:
a plan that does not fit should be refused in the seconds before a cycle
starts, not discovered when a forecast runs out of device memory forty
minutes in.  It is also the difference between a cell count that came from
the generator's own sizing integral and one this layer computed with
sphere-area arithmetic and hoped about.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT QUOTE, AND WHY.  The dry-run receipt carries a
``region_attainment`` block with an ``attained_spacing_km`` per region.
For CAP regions it is right.  For POLYGON regions -- which is every swath
-- it is not: measured 2026-08-26 against the staged ``rw_mpas_mesh``
0.1.0, a 4-degree polygon reports its deepest interior point 19,683 km
inside itself and therefore reports its request exactly met at every size,
where a cap covering comparable ground correctly reports 6.36 km attained
against a 4.00 km request.  The cause is in
``rw-mpas/src/mesh/density.rs::polygon_contains``: a closed ring divides a
SPHERE into two discs and the winding number is +/-2*pi in both, so a test
that accepts on ``abs(winding) > pi`` calls the complement interior too.
The emitted MESHES are unaffected -- the density field integrates
correctly, which is measured -- so this is a reporting defect and swaths
are safe to generate.  But the ruling is that a receipt quotes ATTAINED
spacing and never requested, and a number that is structurally always the
request cannot satisfy it.

So this module quotes attainment from an INSCRIBED CAP PROBE instead: the
same spec, the same background, the same transition, with the swath region
replaced by a cap centred on the swath's own widest point at that point's
half-width.  That cap fits inside the swath, so the spacing the field
reaches inside it is an upper bound on -- never better than -- the spacing
the swath reaches, and it is produced by the same binary on the path that
binary gets right.  It is labelled ``inscribed_cap_probe`` everywhere it
appears.
