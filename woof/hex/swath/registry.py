"""The two documents that decide what is a threat and what beats what.

NOTHING IN THIS PACKAGE BRANCHES ON A PHENOMENON.  A tropical cyclone and
a four-ingredient fire-weather region reach the same eight functions; what
differs between them is a row in ``threat-metrics.v3.json``.  That is
the arbitrary acceptance test applied one level up from a driving
model: if adding "detect derechos" or "detect polar lows" needs a
function, this layer has failed and must be redesigned, not patched.

A COMPOUND THREAT IS ALSO A ROW, which is what v2 added.  A field row's
operands come either from the file (``source_variables``) or from OTHER
FIELD ROWS (``inputs``), so a derived quantity -- a bulk shear, a vapour
pressure deficit, a moisture transport -- is a composition of rows.  The
``threshold_margin`` kind turns any field into a dimensionless distance
past a threshold and ``extremum_of`` takes the weakest of several, so
"hot AND dry AND windy over dry fuel" is five field rows and one metric
row and reaches the SAME ``area_threshold_exceedance`` detector that
finds a blob of reflectivity.

Every vocabulary below is CLOSED and refused at load, by name, with the
breakage stated.  An open vocabulary is how a per-phenomenon branch
re-enters wearing JSON's clothes: a document that may carry
``"kind": "tropical_cyclone_special"`` will eventually carry it, and the
code that honours it is the bandaid.  A document that cannot express it
never gets the chance.

Both documents ship inside the wheel (``woof/hex/data/swath/``) and both
can be replaced from the command line.  A user adding a threat row does
not edit source, which is what makes this reachable after
``pip install woof hex``.

#: How a per-cell scalar is derived.
#:
#: THE FIRST FOUR ARE LEAVES: they read a published history variable and
#: reduce its raw shape to one value per cell.  EVERYTHING ELSE IS AN
#: OPERATOR over per-cell scalars, and an operator may take its operands
#: either from the file (``source_variables``) or from OTHER FIELD ROWS
#: (``inputs``).  That one property is what makes a derived or compound
#: quantity a row instead of a function: integrated transport, a bulk
#: shear, a vapour-pressure deficit and a four-ingredient fire-weather
#: conjunction are all built by composing these, and none of them appears
#: anywhere in this package by name.
#:
#: ``threshold_margin`` is the load-bearing one.  It converts a field into
#: a DIMENSIONLESS distance past a threshold, which is what lets
#: ``extremum_of`` with ``minimum`` express "all of these conditions hold
#: here" over quantities measured in kelvin, per cent, metres per second
#: and cubic metres per cubic metre at the same time.

    THE DEFECT THIS FIXES, measured twice on real global forecasts.  Until
    this column existed, the placement policy divided every candidate's
    ``metric_extremum`` by one shared ``scale``, so a sea-level-pressure
    anomaly in pascals (about 5,000 for a deep low) and a reflectivity
    anomaly in decibels (about 11 for a strong convective core) were added
    to the same score.  They differ by about 470x from UNITS ALONE.  On a
    24 h global forecast that held 41 cyclone tracks and 217
    deep-convection tracks, the twenty-seven highest-ranked candidates of
    205 were all cyclones and a budget of four never reached the
    convection row -- twice, in two independent lanes, on two different
    runs of the same cycle.

    ``intensity_reference`` is the anomaly past the detector's own
    threshold that this row calls one unit of significance.  A row
    declares it because a row is the only thing that knows what its field
    measures.  After the division the term is DIMENSIONLESS, so two rows
    on two fields are on one axis for the first time.
