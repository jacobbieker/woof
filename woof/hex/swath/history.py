"""Reading a coarse forecast the way the detector needs it: on the mesh.

MESH-NATIVE, DELIBERATELY.  Nothing here regrids.  A detector that ran on
a regular latitude/longitude image of the forecast would inherit that
image's pole convergence and its interpolation, and the swath it placed
would sit where the PICTURE said rather than where the model said.  The
search is therefore a walk over ``cellsOnCell`` -- the connectivity the
file already carries -- and every distance is a great circle between two
cell centres.

This module is a READER.  It does not interpolate, transform, or write,
which keeps it on the orchestration side of the Python boundary: the data
path that produced this file is Rust and CUDA, and the data path that
consumes what this layer emits is Rust.

    TWO INPUT SHAPES, ONE READER, AND THE SECOND ONE IS WHY THIS CLASS
    EXISTS IN THIS FORM.  A self-describing history file -- an MPAS-A
    output, or this layer's fixture -- carries its own mesh and all of its
    frames on one ``Time`` axis, and is opened directly.

    THIS PROJECT'S OWN forecast door writes something else.  It writes one
    file per frame, each with ``Time`` of 1, carrying ``latCell`` and
    ``lonCell`` but no ``areaCell``, no ``cellsOnCell``, no
    ``nEdgesOnCell`` and no ``xtime``.  The shipped reader refused it by
    name -- "history file cuda-history.2026-08-12_06.00.00.nc has no
    'areaCell'" -- which meant the placement layer could not read the only
    forecast this project produces.  That refusal is correct and stays:
    the fix is NOT to add variables to the history stream, because those
    frames' digests are pinned by the execution anchors and one extra
    variable breaks every one of them.

    The fix is that the reader also accepts the RUN RECEIPT the same door
    writes beside those frames.  The receipt already names all three
    missing things: the frame sequence and its SHA-256s
    (``forecast.snapshot_files``), the valid time of each frame
    (``forecast.history_labels``), and the grid file the run was bound to
    (``forecast.authority.files.grid``), which is where the connectivity
    lives.  So the artifact the forecast door writes is exactly the
    artifact the swath door consumes, with no intermediate file, no
    filename parsing and no change to a pinned stream.

    ``grid=`` overrides the mesh source for either shape, for a file whose
    connectivity lives elsewhere.

        about 52,900 Pa, roughly 47 kPa below the 100,400 Pa a closed low
