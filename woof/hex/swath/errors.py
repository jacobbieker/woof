"""Refusals this layer makes, each naming the breakage it prevents.

Every class here is an :class:`woof.hex.errors.MpasPortError`, so the
console script's one ``except`` in :func:`woof.hex.cli.main` turns any of
them into exit status 2 with the message on stderr, exactly as every other
door in this distribution behaves.

There are three, and the split is not decoration -- it is what lets a
caller tell "your document is wrong" from "the world did not offer a
placement" from "the placement does not fit the machine", which are three
different things for the operator to do about.
