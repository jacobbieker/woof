"""Spherical geometry for a track-shaped, flared swath.

WHY THIS EMITS A POLYGON AND NOT A NEW SHAPE KIND.  ``rw_mpas_mesh``
already reads three region shapes as DATA -- ``cap``, ``lat_lon_box`` and
``polygon`` -- and the same three rows are what ``rw_mpas_mesh
--cull-parent --region`` accepts for a limited-area cull
(``rw-mpas/src/mesh/cull.rs::boundary_from_shape``).  A ring of
``[lat, lon]`` vertices is therefore ALREADY a swath: the generator
computes exact great-circle distances to its segments and the culler walks
its boundary.  Adding a fourth shape kind for "swath" would put a code
path where a row does, which is the thing the arbitrary acceptance test
exists to stop.  So this module's whole job is to turn (a track polyline,
a half-width profile) into that ring, and to refuse the rings that are not
swaths.

The perpendicular offset is exact for a polygon and needs no Lipschitz
correction.  A correction is needed when a flared swath is expressed as a
signed-distance FIELD -- the boundary of ``distance_to_axis < w(s)`` is
not perpendicular to the axis where ``w`` grows -- but the ring emitted
here IS the boundary, so the generator's own segment distance is the
right answer by construction.

Angles are DEGREES at this module's surface, because that is the unit the
mesh spec's ``center_deg`` / ``vertices_deg`` rows are written in and a
conversion at the boundary is one place to be wrong instead of many.  The
port's mesh arrays are radians (MPAS Registry.xml 1225-1228) and the
detector converts once, on read.

    inherits whatever the parent's mesh does between the cut and the fine
    core.  Cutting at the swath ring itself throws the parent's coarsening
    ramp away, so the boundary stream lands a 71 km parent state on cells the
    fine core's own size.  Cutting WIDER keeps some of that ramp, and the ramp
    is model-solved atmosphere at intermediate resolution -- an intermediate
    level, in the form MPAS has rather than the form WRF has.  How much ramp
    to keep is what this scales, and it is a number in a row.

    THE SCALING IS GEODESIC, NOT IN DEGREES.  Scaling latitude and longitude
    by a factor is a different shape at every latitude; at 60 S it would
    stretch the ring by two in longitude relative to latitude.  Each vertex is
    carried to a unit vector and moved along its great circle to the centroid
    direction, so every centroid-to-vertex arc scales by exactly ``scale`` and
    the ring stays a similar figure over concentric ground.

    ``scale == 1.0`` returns the ring unchanged, so the unscaled case goes

    0.1.0 staged in ``~/.woof/bridges``, receipt in
    ``evidence/swath-following-20260826/``): a closed ring divides a SPHERE
    into two discs and the winding number is +/-2*pi in BOTH -- it is

    ``abs(winding) > pi`` therefore calls the complement interior as well.

    consequence is measured: its ``region_attainment`` lattice search
    finds a "deepest interior point" 19,683 km inside a 4-degree box, so
    every polygon region reports its request exactly met -- a 44 km
    polygon reads ``attained_spacing_km 4.00`` where a 22 km cap of the
    same request correctly reads 6.36.  the ruling is to quote ATTAINED
    spacing and never requested; a number that is structurally always the
    request cannot satisfy it.  The generator's density FIELD is
    unaffected (a 0.4-degree polygon adds 607 cells over uniform, not a

    meshes are correct.  This layer therefore emits polygons freely and
    never consumes the generator's polygon attainment.
