"""Convection admission: the cumulus scheme is OFF below 3 km, by default.

It was ruled on 2026-08-26 that convection is switched off below 3 km,
answering directly whether a fine swath runs the cumulus scheme at all.
This module is that ruling made executable, and it is deliberately the only
place the threshold exists.

THE BREAKAGE THIS GATE PREVENTS, MEASURED (2026-08-26,
``evidence/dt-anchors-20260826/RECEIPT.md``).  WRF pins ``cudt = 0`` for
``cu_physics = 3``, so Grell-Freitas recomputes on every model step and no
configuration relaxes it -- the cumulus cadence IS the timestep.  A finer
mesh declares a smaller timestep, so it calls the closure proportionally
more often: 30 times an hour at the proven 120 s, 180 at 20 s (a 3 km
swath), 720 at 5 s (a 750 m swath).  At 5 s on ``x1.40962`` the measured
|w| mean over four half-hour windows ran 12.0 / 49.6 / 73.5 / 87.5 m/s
against a same-card 120 s control's 1.15 / 1.17 / 1.20 / 1.48, still
climbing at 2 h, with |w| max 102.67 m/s against 1.680.  Every step was
finite and two arms were byte-identical, so it is a different SOLUTION and
not an unstable one -- which is worse, because nothing crashes.

Every mesh the ruling covers sits between six and twenty-four times the
proven call rate.  So the ruling and the measurement point the same way, and
this gate is where they meet.

**Fixed means default.**  A bare run on a sub-3-km mesh selects no cumulus
scheme, with nobody passing a flag.  The explicit switch is an A/B
instrument -- it is how the attribution above is measured -- and a decision
taken through it says ``source: "explicit"`` in its own receipt so it can
never be read as the remedy.

**The finest spacing anywhere on the mesh decides.**  The question the
ruling answered was about a fine SWATH inside a coarser mesh, so a mesh that
is 3 km anywhere is a mesh the ruling covers.  The decision takes the smaller of the row's
declared nominal spacing and the mesh's own measured ``min(dcEdge)``, so a
row that declares one resolution and carries another cannot smuggle the
closure back on.

**Convection-off is a NEW admitted configuration, not a mutation of the
proven one.**  How often a scheme is called is part of what a timestep
anchor certifies (:mod:`woof.hex.dt_admission`), so a convection-off run
earns its own anchors and cannot borrow the Grell-Freitas rows'.  The
frozen v8.4.1 column-physics lane's proven configuration stays exactly
reachable and byte-unchanged.

**The arbitrary acceptance test.**  Selecting the scheme is table work in
one place: a threshold, a named set, and one translation between the config
vocabulary and the sealed constructor's.  Adding a scheme is a row here, not
a new configuration subclass per combination.
