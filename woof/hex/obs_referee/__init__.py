"""Manifest-driven MRMS/ASOS observational referee for woof hex.

The package intentionally does not parse raw MRMS GRIB2 or raw METAR.  Those
boundaries belong to rustwx.  This package validates canonical, checksummed
bundles and performs deterministic matching, metrics, uncertainty, and
reporting.
