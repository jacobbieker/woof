"""A registry row's timestep, overridden for the duration of an anchor mint.

:mod:`woof.hex.dt_admission` resolves half of the mint's chicken-and-egg
problem: ``candidate_mint`` admits ONE unanchored ``config_dt`` while a mint
run is in flight, so the sealed v8.4.1 configuration will build at a timestep
nobody has proven yet.

The other half is the mesh registry.  ``src/hexcore/drivers/mpas_mesh_binding.py`` rows
carry a *declared* timestep, the forecast door computes its step schedule
from that field, and ``bind_mesh`` admits it against the earned-anchor
registry.  So an admitted candidate timestep is not reachable at all unless
some row declares it -- and the rows that declare the interesting values are
exactly the meshes an anchor would unblock, which is backwards: those meshes
are large, and an anchor is a property of the TIMESTEP, not of the mesh.  The
cheap and correct place to earn one is the smallest registered mesh, whose
own Courant limit is an upper bound that every candidate sits far beneath.

Registering four permanent rows for the same mesh files at four timesteps
would be the alternative, and it would leave the shipped registry carrying
rows that exist only because a mint once needed them.  This module is the
narrower thing: one row's ``dt_seconds`` is replaced for the duration of one
mint, on the same files, under the same authorization sentence, and it is
withdrawn on exit.

Everything about the path is loud and it cannot be entered by accident:

* the caller repeats :data:`woof.hex.dt_admission.CANDIDATE_MINT_AUTHORIZATION`
  verbatim, the same sentence the timestep half requires;
* the candidate timestep must ALREADY be admitted as a candidate -- a live
  ``dt_admission.candidate_mint`` whose row is stamped ``CANDIDATE``.  A mesh
  row can therefore never declare a timestep the timestep gate has not itself
  been opened for, in the same breath, by the same caller;
* a timestep holding a REAL anchor is refused here, because a proven timestep
  needs a registered row and not a temporary one;
* the row's ``notes`` are stamped so the string lands in the bind log and the
  run receipt; and
* the override is removed when the mint finishes.

It admits nothing on its own.  What a mint earns is evidence; registering the
anchor that evidence supports is a decision of record.

The state lives here rather than in ``mpas_mesh_binding`` itself because the
forecast door loads that file by path with ``importlib`` and re-executes it
per run, which would reset any module-level state it held.  This module is
imported normally, so it is one object for the life of the process -- the
same property ``dt_admission`` relies on.
