"""The prognostic scalars a microphysics scheme declares, as DATA.

The v841 production chain was welded to WSM6's six species at every layer:
the config dict pinned ``mp_wsm6``, the preparation kernel hardcoded six
output pointers, the tendency/update/recovery contracts spelled six field
names, the driver checked ``scalars.shape[0] == 6`` and summed all six into
the moist coefficients, and the sealed adapter asserted the WSM6 order at
four sites.  Every one of those is the same fact restated, so a scheme with
a different species set could not reach the forecast door at all -- only the
column seam, which takes species by name.

This module is the ONE place that fact lives.  A scheme is a ROW; the row
names its species in model array order, tags each one with what it IS, and
carries the scheme's surface accumulators, effective radii and restart
extras.  Every consumer reads the row instead of restating the six.

THE BREAKAGE THE CLASS TAGS PREVENT, and why three tags were not enough.
``atm_compute_moist_coefficients`` (the ``moist_cell_coefficients_v841_f32``
and ``moist_edge_coefficients_v841_f32`` kernels) forms
``qtot = sum of the moist mass species`` and then ``cqw``/``cqu`` as
``1/(1 + ...)``, and ``moist_dpdz_v841_f32`` carries ``qtot`` into the
buoyancy term.  Those loops ran over ALL leading species unconditionally.
Two distinct ways that breaks on a non-WSM6 row:

* A NUMBER species (``ni``, ``nr``, ``nc``, ``nifa``, ``nwfa``) is a
  concentration, order 1e4 to 1e9 per kilogram or per cubic metre.  Folded
  into ``qtot`` it drives ``1/(1+qtot)`` to approximately zero and puts the
  buoyancy term off by orders of magnitude.  A VOLUME species (``qib``,
  rime ice volume) is not a mass either.
* A MASS species is not automatically a LOADING species.  P3's ``qir`` is
  the rime mass held INSIDE ``qi``, not beside it -- ``qi`` is already the
  total ice mass.  Summing ``qir`` into ``qtot`` double-counts the rimed
  fraction of the ice.  It is a mass, it must ride transport, and it must
  still stay out of the moisture loading.  A three-way mass/number/volume
  tag would have called it "mass" and silently double-counted it, which is
  a wrong answer that no shape check and no order assertion would catch.

Hence four tags, and the loading set is named by :data:`MASS_LOADING`
alone.

THE CONTIGUOUS-PREFIX INVARIANT.  The kernels sum a leading run of species,
so the row refuses any ordering whose mass-loading species are not a
contiguous prefix.  That turns the generalization into a single ``int32``
loop bound (:attr:`MicrophysicsSpeciesRow.n_mass_loading`) instead of a
per-species mask uploaded to the device, and it keeps the WSM6 arm's
accumulation ORDER -- sequential FP32, vapour first -- exactly as it is
today, which is what byte-identity on the frozen lane depends on.

DECLARED EXTRAS.  A later lane may need prognostic scalars that no
microphysics scheme declares -- transported, number-class, never in the
moisture loading -- plus its own surface accumulators.  It declares them
through :meth:`MicrophysicsSpeciesRow.with_extras` and every consumer in
the chain picks them up from the row, so adding a scalar is a declaration
and never another edit to a kernel, a contract, a shape check or an
assertion.  Extras are refused the :data:`MASS_LOADING` tag by name: the
contiguous-prefix invariant means an extra could only be appended AFTER the
scheme's own species, so a mass-loading extra would sit outside the summed
prefix and be silently omitted from the moisture loading it asked to join.
Refusing it is the honest answer; a scheme that genuinely loads the air
differently is a new scheme row, not an extra.

# published 2.6.3 wheel), so the door's array and the seam's kwargs agree
# without a permutation anywhere.  All three engine rows already order
# their mass-loading species first, so the contiguous-prefix invariant
# costs no reordering.

#: Why a declared row has no engine counterparty.  One sentence, one place:
#: two rows share it, and the day the engine publishes a row for either of
#: them the gate in tests/test_species_row.py fails and the deferral

#: published its ``thompson_aero`` row (woof 2.6.3).
