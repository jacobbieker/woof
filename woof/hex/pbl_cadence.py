"""The surface/PBL cadence: a selectable knob, welded to the timestep by default.

``config_bldt_seconds`` is welded to ``config_dt`` by default in
:func:`tools.run_cuda_v841_forecast.build_forecast_config` -- the native x4
v8.4.1 reference ran ``bldt = dt``, i.e. the surface layer, the land-surface
model and the PBL are called on every model step.  That is the proven
configuration's own semantics and it stays the default: ``auto`` is
``bldt = dt`` with nobody passing a flag, and it changes no existing run.

**An explicit cadence is a selectable configuration.**  ``--pbl-cadence
SECONDS`` calls the surface/PBL stack once every ``SECONDS / dt`` steps and
HOLDS the tendency it produced on the steps between -- the engine's own
positive-``bldt`` path, which is ARW's ``stepbl``: the held rate is applied
unchanged on every non-due step, and the surface layer and land-surface
model integrate their own state with the cadence as their step
(``dtturbl = bldt``).  Nothing about the hold is implemented here; the seam
passes the cadence to the engine's sealed constructor and the engine's
``PhysicsDriver`` does what it does for every ARW run with a positive
``bldt``.  Radiation is on its own fixed cadence
(:data:`woof.hex.dt_admission.RADIATION_CADENCE_SECONDS`) and was never
welded to ``dt``; the decision records it beside the surface/PBL cadence so
a receipt names every physics call rate the run uses.

WHY IT IS A KNOB AT ALL.  At the 5 s a sub-kilometre mesh declares the weld
calls the stack 720 times an hour against the 30 the proven 120 s
configuration runs, and the per-step profile of 2026-09-13 (RTX 5090, the
43,884-cell point mesh) put the seam's surface/PBL phase at a fifth of every
step.  Holding the cadence is the direct way to buy that back, and it
changes the answer, so per the project's rule for modes that change
results it is SELECTABLE and never silently the default: the welded default
moves only on a measured recommendation, and the measurement is recorded
in ``docs/hex-point-hrrr.md``.

THE REFUSAL.  A cadence that is not a whole number of steps is refused HERE,
on the host, before a mesh is bound or a card is reserved, naming both
numbers and the multiples of ``dt`` on either side of the request.  The
sealed constructor asks the same question after the card is reserved,
which is the wrong place to learn it.  Nothing is rounded silently: a 25 s
request at 10 s steps could mean 20 s or 30 s and the run would call a
cadence the receipt did not name.

THE BREAKAGE THE REGISTRY KEY PREVENTS (gate law, 2026-08-16).  A timestep
anchor certifies a CONFIGURATION, and how often a scheme is CALLED is part
of what its forecasts measured, so :func:`woof.hex.dt_admission.dt_key` keys
on the surface/PBL cadence.  Without that key fragment a held-cadence
anchor would occupy the SAME registry slot as the welded row at the same
``(dt, cumulus)`` and silently replace it, after which every ordinary
welded run at that timestep would be admitted against a band measured at
one twenty-fourth of its own surface/PBL call rate.  A held cadence at an
anchored timestep is admitted through a DERIVED row
(:func:`woof.hex.dt_admission.derived_held_cadence_anchor`): the dycore
half of the anchor -- the step, its RK schedule, its clock, its
byte-identical dual run -- is the welded row's own and is unchanged by how
often the seam calls the stack; the host half is re-minted for the held
cadence at admission; the physics band is stamped NOT MEASURED at this
cadence rather than borrowed.

THE MEASUREMENT OF RECORD (2026-08-26, x1.40962 at 5 s, RTX 5070 Ti,
``evidence/pbl-cadence-20260826/``): holding the cadence at 120 s while
``dt`` shrank to 5 s on a 120 km mesh 140x below its own Courant limit did
NOT flatten that configuration's |w| runaway -- it reached |w| max 134.55
against 81.77 over the same first 964 steps and then stopped integrating.
That arm answered an attribution question (the surface/PBL call rate is
not the cause of the runaway) on a configuration nobody would run for
weather; it says nothing about a held cadence on a mesh whose natural step
IS 5 s, which is what the 2026-09-13 campaign measures.

THE ARBITRARY ACCEPTANCE TEST.  Holding a cadence is table work in one
place: a request vocabulary, one resolution against ``dt``, and one decision
record.  A second cadence becoming holdable is a row here, not a new
configuration subclass per combination.
