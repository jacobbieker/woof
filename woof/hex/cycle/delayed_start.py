"""Starting a fine grid in the middle of its parent's window.

THE COST THIS REMOVES.  A swath is placed for weather the coarse forecast says
will be there at hour 12, not at hour 0.  Until now the only initial condition
a limited-area cull could have was its parent's INIT -- the state at hour 0 --
so covering that threat meant integrating the fine grid from hour 0 and
throwing the first twelve hours away.  On the 1.35x cut of the 4.6 km cascade
that is 6 h of fine forecast spent on an atmosphere nobody placed a grid for,
per cycle, per swath, and it grows with every hour of lead.

THE SEAM THAT MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE, and it is the delayed-start seam.  The parent's own
history stream is a PRODUCT stream, not a restart stream.  Measured on a real
121,182-cell parent frame: it publishes ``theta``, ``rho``, ``qv``, the five
hydrometeors, ``normal_u``, ``w``, ``pressure``, the surface fields and the
soil columns -- but it carries **no** ``xtime``, **no** ``zgrid``/``zz``, **no**
base state, and none of the mesh connectivity.  It cannot be handed to
anything as an initial condition, and that is why a fine grid could only ever
start where its parent started.

THE ROUTE THIS SHIPS.  Everything the history stream is missing is
TIME-INVARIANT, and all of it is in the parent's own init: the vertical grid,
the base state, the terrain, the geography, the connectivity.  So a mid-window
initial condition is the culled init with its PROGNOSTIC state replaced by the
parent's state at the hour the swath wanted, and its clock moved to match.

* the cull is the supported route and stays the supported route -- grid,
  static and init out of the parent in about a second, against 775 s to
  build that parent's own init (v4.75.121182, 2026-08-26) rather than a
  native regional init;
* the parent's history frame is gathered onto the child's cells by EXACT
  COORDINATE MATCH.  A cull moves no cell centre, so a child cell's
  ``latCell``/``lonCell`` are the parent's float64 bits unchanged; the map is
  built on those bits as an integer pair and **a miss is a refusal**, never a
  nearest neighbour.  Folding the two words into one hash would admit a
  collision, and two different cells reading as one another is exactly the
  failure a state transplant cannot survive;
* no engine change and no second grammar: this is a gather, in Python, over
  files the shipped chain already writes.

WHAT A DELAYED START DOES NOT CARRY, measured against the two files rather
than asserted, and reported on every composition it makes:

* **the ice-phase hydrometeors.** The parent publishes ``qi``/``qs``/``qg``
  and the init has no slot for them, so the fine grid starts with the liquid
  condensate the parent had and no frozen condensate at all.  A run started
  inside an active ice cloud re-forms it, and the first hour is a spin-up.
* **the land-surface memory the history stream does not publish** -- snow
  water equivalent, snow depth, snow cover, sea ice, canopy state.  Soil
  temperature, soil moisture and skin temperature ARE carried, because the
  parent publishes them.
* **turbulent kinetic energy**, for the same reason.

Every one of those is named in the receipt this module writes, per field, with
whether it was carried, and from which file.
