"""One cycle of the coarse-then-corridor cascade, end to end.

Everything this project had built was a SNAPSHOT.  Detection, placement,
culling, a limited-area full-physics forecast and a composite render all
worked once, from one coarse run, at one hour.  Nothing had ever followed
weather from one cycle into the next: the plan layer grew hysteresis, slot
continuity and a move-or-stay decision with nobody to hand them to, and the
regional gate charged a forecast mint for every re-placed cull, which made
following weather cost about three forecasts per swath per cycle.

This module is the loop those parts were built for, and it is ONE function
over a table.  A cycle is:

    parent forecast -> detect + plan (hysteresis decides move or stay)
                    -> cull the parent, at the row's own pad
                    -> a mid-window initial condition, when the threat is late
                    -> boundaries from the coarse parent
                    -> a contract deck on THIS cull's rings
                    -> a registered row written from the cull's own bytes
                    -> full-physics fine forecast
                    -> composite render
                    -> the state the next cycle continues from

THE ARBITRARY ACCEPTANCE TEST.  There is no phenomenon anywhere in this file.
A tropical cyclone, a convective area, a fire-weather region and an
atmospheric river are ROWS in ``threat-metrics.v3``; they reach this loop as
``admitted`` entries carrying a cull region, a mesh spec, an ignition hour and
a pad, and this module cannot tell them apart.  Adding a phenomenon is a row.
If a future edit needs a branch on ``threat_class`` here, the design failed.

WHAT A CYCLE COSTS, and what the 2026-08-27 anchor re-keying changed.  Before
it, a re-placed cull paid a contract deck PLUS two 1,080-step forecast mints
-- 5.5 to 8.7 minutes of card measured on four meshes -- before its own 4-6
minute forecast was allowed to run.  Now the mint is a property of the
CONFIGURATION CLASS and is earned once; the residual per-geometry cost is the
deck alone, and this loop measures it every cycle and puts the number in its
receipt.

    ratio is meaningful whether or not either is in metres.  Printing one of

    made of the parent's BACKGROUND cells.  Measured on the first run: 457
    cells whose finest edge is 70,983 m, against the parent's own 4,457 m.

    Nothing about that fails loudly.  It binds, it admits, and it integrates a

    produces a full set of frames that look like a forecast and resolve
    nothing the coarse parent did not already have.  The cost is a whole fine
    slot, and the output is indistinguishable from a real one without reading
    dcEdge.

    An operational cascade answers this by REGENERATING the parent for the new
    placement (a mesh, a static and an init: about twenty minutes on this
