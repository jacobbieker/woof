"""Registering a cull the cascade placed this cycle, from its own bytes.

THE BLOCKER THIS REMOVES, and it is not the anchor.  ``woof hex forecast``
resolves ``--mesh`` against ``woof.hex.drivers.mpas_mesh_binding.MESH_BINDINGS`` and
refuses a name it does not hold, by name:

    running an unregistered mesh would run an unproved shape at an unadmitted
    timestep

That refusal is right about a mesh somebody downloaded.  It is unanswerable
for a mesh the cascade CUT four seconds ago: a storm-following swath
re-places itself every cycle, so a cycling cascade would need a hand-written
Python row per swath per cycle, forever, and could never run unattended.

WHAT A REGISTRY ROW ACTUALLY BUYS, separated.  The row does two different
things and only one of them needs a human:

1. **It pins bytes.**  Byte count and SHA-256, so the file you run is the file
   that was reviewed.  For a cull the cascade made and hashed in the same
   chain, that guarantee is available by construction -- the row is written
   FROM the cull receipt, and ``bind_mesh`` re-hashes both files anyway, so a
   row that lies about its bytes refuses at bind exactly as a hand-written one
   would.

2. **It carries a declared shape and timestep** -- and every gate behind those
   is a MEASUREMENT, not a review.  The Courant admission reads the file's own
   ``dcEdge``; the dual-edge admission reads its own ``dvEdge/dcEdge``; the
   cell-coordination admission counts its own polygon sides; the regional
   admission re-measures its own ``bdyMask`` digest and ring shell; the
   timestep is refused unless an anchor covers it; the device admission
   measures the card.  None of those become weaker because nobody typed the
   row.

WHAT IS GENUINELY LOST, and it is stated rather than argued away: a human
reading the row is a real check, and a cascade row does not have one.  What
replaces it is the per-geometry CONTRACT DECK -- 8 decks bitwise against the
v8.4.1 CPU authority on this cull's own zone geometry, every mutation control
with teeth -- which the cascade runs before the forecast and which is a
stronger statement about the rings than a person reading a cell count.  A
cascade row with no deck behind it is refused at the regional gate regardless
of what this module does.

WHAT THIS MODULE REFUSES:

* a row whose cull receipt does not name a parent that is itself a REGISTERED
  row.  Lineage stops at something a person did register, always -- a cull of
  a cull of an unregistered mesh is how a shape nobody ever looked at becomes
  a forecast;
* a row whose declared bytes do not match the files on disk right now;
* a row carrying a boundary zone and no ``lbc_source``, which is the existing
  registry refusal and is not relaxed here;
* a name that collides with a shipped row.  A cascade row may never shadow one.

Rows are supplied through a FILE, not a context manager, because the door
runs the driver in another process and a process-local override would be
invisible to it.  ``woof.hex.drivers.mpas_mesh_binding`` applies them where it builds
``MESH_BINDINGS``, the same hook ``mesh_row_candidate`` uses, so the door's
by-path re-execution of that module picks them up as the first copy did.
