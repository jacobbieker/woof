"""Run and prove the pinned real-x4 MPAS-A v8.4.1 CUDA physics chain.

The production path is deliberately closed until every moving source below has
an exact frozen SHA-256.  Once released, one invocation performs:

* one uninterrupted 30 x 120 s full-physics CUDA forecast;
* F000/F030/F001 boundary snapshots and quantitative comparison with the
  sealed native CPU GF+YSU-GWDO authority;
* one checkpoint/restart continuation from F030 through F001; and
* an exact-byte comparison of uninterrupted and restored committed F001 state,
  saved diagnostics, Arwen persistence, surface/soil state, precipitation, and
  the six external YSU-GWDO diagnostics.

The finalized fa35 Arwen contract is the execution target.  Its documented GF
deviation is retained honestly: MPAS computes endpoint ``rthdynten/rqvdynten``,
but fa35 has no API lane for them and supplies zero GF advective forcing.  This
tool therefore never claims bitwise/source-native GF parity.  It does require
real weather evolution and records quantitative native comparisons.

CUDA and production imports are lazy.  Closed authority bytes, source pins,
constructor mappings, output scope, and the staged transaction API are checked
before a CUDA device is probed.

    # timestep the frozen lane was never proven at while every proof still
    # reported frozen sources -- exactly the hole recovery.py was pinned to
    # close.
    # Re-frozen 2026-08-26 for the timestep anchors the ruling for that day named:
    # ADMITTED_TIMESTEPS gained rows at 100, 75, 20 and 5 s, each naming the
    # campaign that earned it (evidence/dt-anchors-20260826/RECEIPT.md) and
    # each recording native_reference=None, because the one native MPAS-A
    # v8.4.1 integration this program holds ran at 120 s and no other timestep
    # can ever have that half.  The pinned config's meaning depends on these
    # bytes -- V841MpasColumnPhysicsConfig.validate admits config_dt from this
    # table -- so every proof that verifies frozen sources re-runs against this
    # digest.  No executable behaviour outside the table changed.
    # Re-frozen again 2026-08-26 for the convection ruling: the registry is
    # keyed by the CONFIGURATION (dt, cumulus selection) rather than by the timestep
    # alone, because switching the closure off changes how often it is
    # called from "every step" to "never" and that is part of what an
    # anchor's forecasts measured.  Every existing row keeps its evidence
    # and its meaning; a convection-off run can no longer read one.  Two
    # convection-off rows were then EARNED on the proving RTX 5070 Ti at 20 s and 5 s
    # (evidence/convection-off-20260826/), and the 5 s Grell-Freitas row's
    # open attribution was retired against them: with the closure never
    # called the same timestep still reaches |w| max 93.96 against its
    # 102.67, so GF's call rate is NOT the cause.  Table and refusal text
    # only; no executable behaviour outside them changed.
    # Re-frozen a third time 2026-08-26 for the surface/PBL cadence campaign:
    # the registry key gained its third fragment, the cadence itself, for the
    # identical reason the second was added.  config_bldt_seconds is welded
    # to dt exactly as cudt is, so 5 s calls the surface layer, the LSM and
    # the PBL 720 times an hour against the proven 30 -- and the
    # convection-off A/B eliminated Grell-Freitas while leaving that
    # call-rate shape standing (91.4% of the 5 s excess survived the closure
    # never being called).  THE BREAKAGE THE KEY PREVENTS: without the
    # fragment a held-cadence anchor would occupy the SAME slot as the
    # welded row at the same (dt, cumulus) and silently replace it, after
    # which every ordinary welded run at that timestep would be admitted
    # against a band measured at 24x its own call rate.  require_dt_anchor
    # keeps the near-miss diagnostic: a cadence with no row of its own but a
    # welded sibling still refuses with the cadence-mismatch sentence rather
    # than "nothing is anchored here".  Table, key and refusal text only; no
    # executable behaviour outside them changed.
    # Re-frozen 2026-08-27 for the provenance scrub.  THE BREAKAGE
    # THIS PIN MOVE PREVENTS: the public assembly rewrites provenance out of
    # the shipped source, and until this cut it did so on the COPY.  Six
