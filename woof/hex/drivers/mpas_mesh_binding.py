    #
    # THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS, MEASURED (2026-08-26, the proving RTX 5090): a
    # row declaring dt = 100 s -- Courant-admitted against its mesh's own
    # 103.67 s limit, dual-edge admitted at 2.08x the floor, dividing the
    # 600 s radiation cadence exactly -- bound clean, allocated 18,820 MiB,
    # ran 285 s of setup, and died inside composite step 0 with
    # ``post-RK candidate time must equal the exact step endpoint:
    # 120.0 != 100.0``. The rebind reaches DT_SECONDS in the proof and
    # forecast modules and the GWDO guards, but the DYCORE reads
    # ``self.config.config_dt``, and V841MpasColumnPhysicsConfig.validate
    # refuses any value but 120.0 ("the matched v8.4.1 real-x4
    # column-physics lane is exact"), alongside config_bldt_seconds and
    # config_cudt_seconds. Every mesh that has ever run this door declares
    # 120 s. Checked AFTER dual-edge admission so the recorded refusal of
    # v15.150.38857 keeps naming its collapsed edges.
    #
    # The literal comparison this replaced said the same thing with one
    # number. It now asks the EARNED-ANCHOR registry
    # (woof.hex.dt_admission), the same surface the config validates
    # through, so a row and a run can never disagree about which timesteps
    # are admitted, and the refusal names the evidence an anchor needs
    # rather than an adjective. Registering a second anchor is a decision of record, not
    # a registry edit.
    #
    # The anchor certifies a CONFIGURATION at a timestep, so the cumulus
    # selection is decided BEFORE the lookup, from this mesh's own finest
    # spacing.  it was ruled on 2026-08-26 that convection is switched off
    # below 3 km; ``convection='auto'`` is that default and needs no flag.
    # THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS: a sub-3-km mesh binding against a
    # Grell-Freitas anchor and then running with the closure off, so the row
    # admitting the run would have measured a forcing the run never applies.
