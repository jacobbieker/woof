"""The MPAS render door: history files in, product PNGs out, Rust path only.

``mpas-port render`` is the user-reachable command over two Rust binaries:

* ``rw_mpas_convert`` (woof ``tools/rustwx/crates/rw-mpas``) resamples one or
  more MPAS history frames onto a named render window and writes
  wrfout-shaped netCDF frames, with a JSON receipt carrying the mesh,
  weights and per-frame output digests.
* ``rw_wrfbatch`` (woof ``tools/rustwx/crates/rw-wrfbatch``) imports each
  frame and draws the product PNGs.  Product availability is proven by the
  renderer's own ``--list-products`` catalog against the stored fields,
  never guessed from filenames.

This module is deliberately subprocess-and-stdlib only: every byte of field
data is decoded, resampled and drawn in Rust.  Python here is orchestration --
resolving executables, sequencing the two engines, filing the finished PNGs
into the ruled ``<domain>/<product>/<valid-day>/`` layout and writing the
manifest.  There is no fallback plotter behind it.

Scratch discipline: conversion frames, per-frame render stores and the raw
engine output live in a scratch directory that is a SIBLING of ``--out``,
never inside it.  A ``.rwstore-*`` scratch tree inside a delivered png tree
is a shipped defect this door refuses to repeat; an explicit ``--scratch``
inside ``--out`` is refused by name.
