"""Earned-anchor admission for regional (limited-area) CUDA execution.

Ruled 2026-08-25 as part of the LAM campaign: *regional execution
is refused by name until a registered regional anchor exists*, mirroring the
per-architecture pattern in :mod:`woof.hex.cuda_backend.arch_admission`.

The reasoning is the same one that admits an architecture below the proven
floor.  The port's CUDA numbers are trusted because they are checked against
something: the global lane against the frozen v8.4.1 authority set, an
unproven architecture against its own minted anchor.  A regional
configuration has neither until somebody mints one, so a regional forecast
run without an anchor produces numbers no receipt could be compared to.  The
concrete breakage this gate prevents is therefore not a crash: it is a
regional forecast that looks finished, carries a receipt, and was never
checked against anything at all.

AN ANCHOR HAS TWO HALVES AND THEY DO NOT KEY THE SAME WAY.  This is the
2026-08-27 re-keying, and it retires a measured tax rather than relaxing a
gate.

* the **contract deck** measures every regional kernel's device bits against
  the CPU authority's host-derived expected bits ON ONE CULL'S OWN ZONE
  GEOMETRY, with a mutation control per deck proving the deck can fail.  What
  it certifies is a geometry.  It stays keyed to the geometry -- one row per
  ``bdyMask`` digest -- and it is cheap: 39 s at 4,440 cells, 142 s at 15,755
  (``evidence/nest-ratio-20260827/RECEIPT.md`` section 3b).

* the **forecast mint** runs the same configuration twice in two independent
  processes and compares the published history under masked digests.  What it
  certifies is that this KERNEL SET, at this TIMESTEP, on a domain of this
  SHAPE CLASS, reproduces itself.  It is two 1,080-step integrations -- 5.5
  to 8.7 minutes of card measured on four new meshes, against 4-6 minutes for
  the forecast it is admitting.

Keying the MINT to a cull's own bytes charged that 5.5-8.7 minutes again for
every re-placed cull.  A storm-following swath re-places itself every cycle
and a re-placed cull is a new digest, so the cascade paid roughly three
forecasts of card time per swath per cycle for permission to run one.

**Under the gate law that per-digest mint cannot name the breakage it
prevents.**  The measurement is in the nest-ratio receipt: five concentric
culls of ONE parent, 4,440 to 15,755 cells, all carrying the parent's own
finest edge of 4,457.233 m, all seven rings wide, all at dt 20 s -- five
independent mints, five identical verdicts, and all five earned the same 20 s
anchor at the same 1.605x Courant margin.  Nothing the mint measures
distinguished them.  the project rule is that a guard must name the concrete
breakage it prevents, and "this cull's bytes are new" is not one when every
input the mint reads is the same.

So the mint keys to the CONFIGURATION CLASS, and the class key is exactly the
set of inputs the mint's own instrument reads and its verdict depends on:

``boundary_zone_width``
    How many rings the culler grew.  Every regional stage -- the specified
    zone, the relaxation zone's Rayleigh and Laplacian terms, the mask-4/5
    scalar downgrade -- is indexed by ring, so a zone of a different width is
    a different set of stages and the mint says nothing about it.

``n_vert_levels``
    Every regional kernel launches over ``(levels, elements)``; a different
    column height is a different launch geometry for all 22 of them.

``finest_edge_m``
    ``min(dcEdge)``, measured off the mesh in hand.  It is what the Courant
    admission keys on, what ``config_len_disp`` follows, and what
    ``convection_admission`` takes its decision on.  It is also the one
    length a cull cannot change: a cull moves no cell centre, so every cull
    containing the parent's fine core carries the parent's own finest edge.

``dt_seconds``
    The relaxation-zone coefficients are hardwired at 50 and 10 times dt, so
    the boundary stages are dt-dependent by construction.  A mint at one
    timestep says nothing about another.

``kernel_set_sha256``
    A digest over the source of every translation unit the regional step
    launches through.  The mint is a statement about bytes; if the bytes
    move, the statement lapses.  Nothing checked this before -- the mint
    RECORDED its source digests and no admission ever re-read them.

**What class keying does NOT relax.**  A cull of an admitted class is still
refused until its own contract deck has been run and its receipt presented:
8 of 8 decks bitwise against the v8.4.1 CPU authority on THIS cull's zone
geometry, 22 of 22 declared kernels covered, every mutation control with
teeth.  The residual per-geometry admission cost is that deck and nothing
else.

**And what the pair of halves still does not admit** is unchanged and stated
on every row: the mint pair is the DRY regional dycore, so an anchor
certifies the 22 boundary kernels and says nothing on its own about the WOOF
physics seam a full-physics run also drives; and endpoint byte-identity
against the compiled reference is NOT measured here, and is not measured for
the global lane either.

    for the same reason: this program has already lost a day to two
    classifiers hashing the same arrays two different ways.

    EACH NAME RESOLVES TO THE FILE THIS INTERPRETER WILL LAUNCH, through
    :mod:`woof.hex.shipped_sources`, and that is the wheel-reach defect's fix.  The
    constant this replaced walked three directories up from here and assumed
    a checkout underneath; from an installed wheel that lands on
    ``<venv>/lib/python3.13``, where no ``src/`` exists, so this function
    refused and took the whole limited-area lane -- 0.2.0's headline -- with
    it on every machine, with no flag that could open it.  The names are
    unchanged, the bytes under them in a checkout are unchanged, and the

    eleven of the fourteen PAYLOADS moved with them, because the same token is
    an import line and an NVRTC ``module_key`` inside those files.  The digest
    therefore lapsed, which is the cost a name-framed digest exists to charge;
    the alternative, keeping a retired directory name in the declaration so the
    arithmetic would not notice, is a gate reporting on a path nothing
    executes.  What the move was NOT is measured and stated at
    :data:`MINTED_KERNEL_SET_SHA256`.

    The gate did not lose its teeth in the move.  It gained them where it had
    none: from a wheel it now digests the modules in ``site-packages`` that

#: test_regional_forecast_anchor.py`` re-computes it from the sources and
#: refuses a mismatch by name, so a kernel edit that silently kept an anchor
#: alive is impossible.
#: RE-MINTED 2026-08-27 for the provenance scrub.  Three of the
#: fourteen hashed sources moved -- ``cuda_driver.py`` and ``regional_v841.py``
#: carried a person's name, a node label and a machine-shaped rig description
#: in comments and docstrings, and those had to leave the PRIVATE tree rather
#: than the public copy, because this digest is evaluated at ADMISSION time
#: from the shipped tree: a copy scrubbed after the fact refuses every regional
#: CUDA run at the door of the published package while its wheel builds clean
#: and its audit passes.  The move is measured inert
#: (``evidence/scrub-pins-20260827/``: identical ASTs with docstrings stripped
#: and string constants normalised), but a mint is a statement about BYTES, so
#: it lapsed and was RE-TAKEN rather than re-pointed -- both rows below carry
#: fresh two-process mint pairs on this digest.
#:
#: RE-DERIVED 2026-08-28 for the 0.2.0 package rename, and this is a different
#: KIND of move from the one above, which is why it is written out rather than
#: folded into that paragraph.  The provenance scrub moved BYTES: three sources were edited and
#: the two shipped classes were RE-MINTED on the card, two fresh 1,080-step
#: pairs, 17 min 29 s of a 5090.  The rename moved NAMES and the spelling of
#: one identifier: all fourteen declared names changed prefix, and eleven of
#: the fourteen files changed bytes by the substitution of the token
#: ``mpas_port`` with ``woof.hex`` AND NOTHING ELSE -- measured, not argued.
#: Each of those eleven is byte-identical to its pre-rename self once that one
#: identifier is substituted, which is a stronger statement than the provenance scrub's
#: AST comparison and needs no docstring-stripping to make.  The 32 lines
#: carrying the token are 19 comment, docstring and cross-reference lines, 12
#: NVRTC ``module_key`` / module-name labels, and one import.  Not one is
#: inside a CUDA source string, so no kernel's compiled text differs, and the
#: only thing a ``module_key`` selects is a cache slot and an observer label.
#:
#: WHAT IS THEREFORE OWED, said plainly rather than dodged: the two rows below
#: name mint receipts taken at kernel set ``237630342e...``, and this constant
#: is no longer that value.  Those receipts are NOT re-pointed and their prose
#: is not edited to pretend otherwise.  A re-mint at this digest -- the four
#: 1,080-step integrations the provenance scrub paid for, on a card -- is an OPEN follow-up of
#: the 0.2.0 cut and was not taken when this constant was re-derived.
#: The constant moved anyway because the alternative is worse by a wide margin:
#: a stale value here is not a failing test, it is ``require_regional_anchor``
#: refusing every limited-area run at the door of the shipped package, which is
#: the wheel-reach defect's breakage restaged.  Only one half of the anchor is in
#: question: every cull's contract deck still measures device bits against the
#: v8.4.1 CPU authority on its own zone geometry, and a spelling cannot touch
#: that.
#:
#: RE-DERIVED 2026-09-14 for the host path of the forecast step (the hex
#: performance campaign's hostpath lane).  Three of the fourteen sources
#: moved, all of them HOST Python and none of them a CUDA source string:
#: ``cuda_backend/runtime.py`` (the admission is measured once per process
#: and answered from memory; ``launch_checked`` launches once with no event
#: and no synchronize), ``cuda_driver.py`` (its two ``recover_state`` calls
#: pass ``timing_repeats=0``, so each recovery kernel is launched once instead
#: of twice), and ``cuda_regional_forecast_v841.py`` (the garbage discipline
#: restores every padded argument of a launch in one launch, and the density
#: and recovered-state validations set the step's flag on the device instead
#: of draining the stream per array).  Every regional kernel's source is
#: byte-unchanged -- ``cuda_regional_v841.py`` is not among the three, and the
#: contract deck re-run on the point cull at this digest records the same
#: ``translation_unit.source_sha256`` as the receipt taken at the previous
#: digest -- and the shared translation units' compile keys are the same in
#: both arms' receipts.  What was RE-MINTED at this digest: the point class
#: ``graded-869m-dt5-z7``, on the 43,884-cell point cull, in the same session
#: as a forecast of the untouched tree (its row says what was measured).  The
#: other four classes carry this digest through the constant and record the
#: lapse here rather than pretend a re-mint; their kernels launch the same
#: compiled text they were minted on.
#:
#: RE-DERIVED 2026-09-14 for the element-parallel launch geometry of the
#: level-independent dycore kernels (the hex performance campaign's kernels
#: lane).  Six of the fourteen sources moved, and this time the CUDA source
#: strings themselves moved: ``cuda_driver.py``, ``cuda_dynamics_v841.py``,
#: ``cuda_horizontal.py``, ``cuda_horizontal_v841.py``,
#: ``cuda_regional_v841.py`` and ``cuda_transport.py`` re-map every kernel
#: whose levels are independent from one thread per owner looping over
#: levels to one thread per ``(tracer, level, owner)`` element in a
#: grid-stride loop, and ``cuda_regional_forecast_v841.py`` launches them
#: per element; the momentum kernel gathers a once-per-run reference wind
#: instead of evaluating cosf/sinf per neighbour per stage.  What did NOT
#: move is the per-element arithmetic: each element runs the former loop
#: body for its level with the same operands in the same order, the
#: vertically implicit column solve keeps its per-column form, and the claim
#: is measured rather than argued -- the cull's own contract deck at this
#: digest (8 of 8 decks bitwise against the v8.4.1 CPU authority, 22 of 22
#: kernels, dual run identical) and a per-kernel capture-and-replay of every
#: re-mapped kernel against the previous translation units on the point
#: cull's live state (``tools/kernel_element_ab.py``).  What was RE-MINTED
#: at this digest: the point class ``graded-869m-dt5-z7``, on the 43,884-cell

#: the re-mapped text computes the minted bits is the deck and the per-kernel
#: replay above, not a re-run of their own mints.

#: RE-DERIVED 2026-09-14 for the landing of the two moves above together
#: (the hex performance campaign's kernels-land lane).  The host-path move
#: and the element-parallel re-map were taken on separate branches from the
#: same base and each re-derived this constant on its own; merged, the
#: fourteen sources carry both: ``cuda_driver.py``,
#: ``cuda_backend/recovery.py`` and ``cuda_regional_forecast_v841.py`` hold
#: a lane each in different lines (the CUDA source strings are the re-map's,
#: the host path's once-per-kernel launch helper around them), and the other
#: eleven are one lane's or neither's.  One line moved beyond the union:
#: ``cuda_regional_forecast_v841.py`` gained a public reading of the garbage
#: discipline's unit-pool registry (``bound_to_unit_pool``), so the
#: per-kernel replay can reproduce a launch's scrub after the run; it reads
#: a dictionary and launches nothing.  What was RE-MINTED at this digest:
#: the point class ``graded-869m-dt5-z7`` on the 43,884-cell point cull (its
#: row says what was measured).  The other four classes carry this digest
#: through the constant and record the lapse here rather than pretend a
#: re-mint, on the reasoning of the two notes above: the cull's contract
#: deck at the merged text and the per-kernel replay against the integrated
#: tree's translation units are the evidence that the merged text computes
#: the minted bits.

#: digest as the class admitting it, all 8 decks are bitwise against the CPU
#: authority, all 22 declared kernels are covered, and every mutation control
