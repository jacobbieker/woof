"""Architecture admission, and the record of which architectures hold an anchor.

Every NVIDIA architecture that can build and launch this port's kernels runs
it, by default, the way every other model runs on whatever card it is given.
Nothing in this module refuses a card for lacking an anchor.

WHAT AN ANCHOR IS.  The port's numerical contract (the FTZ/subnormal
behaviour of the kernels' arithmetic, the NVRTC contraction pin and the
frozen authority digests) was first measured on sm_120, compute capability
12.0 (:data:`PROVEN_COMPUTE`).  An anchor is that contract measured again on
real hardware of another architecture:

* a **contract receipt**: the measured subnormal/FTZ behaviour of the
  kernels' actual arithmetic and the contraction pin under the port's own
  NVRTC flags, on a card of that architecture; and
* an **authority anchor**: the frozen-authority verification run on that
  architecture, recording per item either byte-identity with the sm_120
  masked digests or a stable, twice-reproduced per-architecture digest set.

:data:`ADMITTED_BELOW_FLOOR` is that record.  Its name is older than the open
admission, from when a row was also a permission; it is now evidence only.
A card of an anchored architecture runs on a contract somebody measured on
that architecture, a card of any other architecture runs too, and every
receipt says which of the two it was (:func:`architecture_status`).  A
receipt never claims an anchor its architecture does not hold.

Each entry pins the exact evidence it rests on: ``evidence_sha256`` is
:func:`evidence_digest` over the evidence directory its contract receipt sits
in.  A tree that carries the receipts checks the pin against the files (and
opens them: the verdict, the card, the authority digests and the timing
readings each have to say what the entry says); a tree that ships without
receipts still names, byte for byte, the one record its entry was admitted
on.

WHAT STILL REFUSES, EACH NAMING ITS BREAKAGE (the gate law).

* **A card NVRTC cannot compile for** (:func:`nvrtc_refusal`).  Every kernel
  this port launches is compiled by NVRTC when the run starts, for the card's
  own ``compute_XY`` target.  The kernels ask for nothing an older card
  lacks: 32-bit integer ``atomicExch``, static shared memory under 8 KiB a
  block, IEEE FP64 arithmetic and float/integer bit reinterpretation; no warp
  intrinsics, no half or bfloat16 types, no inline PTX and no cooperative
  groups (a census of every CUDA source string in this package, 2026-09-29).
  So the floor is the toolchain's, not the kernels': the port requires the
  CUDA 13 runtime (``require_cuda``'s ``min_runtime_version``), whose NVRTC
  generates code for compute_75 (Turing) and newer.  The check asks NVRTC
  itself (:func:`nvrtc_target_archs`), so a toolkit that adds or drops a
  target moves the answer without an edit here.
* **A card whose predicted memory does not fit**, in
  :mod:`woof.hex.device_admission`, unchanged.
* **A card whose ordinary arithmetic is not IEEE** (:func:`numeric_route_refusal`),
  from :func:`measure_numeric_route`, which the forecast door runs on an
  unanchored card.

HOW THE RUN'S OWN GATE READS THIS MODULE.  ``cuda_backend.runtime.require_cuda``
asks :func:`admitted_architecture` about a card below its ``min_compute`` and
refuses with :func:`below_floor_refusal` when the answer is ``None``.  Both
now answer the NVRTC question and nothing else.  ``runtime.py`` itself is
left as it is: it is one of the fourteen sources the regional kernel-set
digest covers (``regional_admission.REGIONAL_KERNEL_SOURCES``), so moving one
of its bytes would lapse every minted limited-area class.  Its comment at
that call still describes the per-architecture gate this module retired.
Its ``required_compute`` pin is read only for a card at or above
``min_compute``, so a ``required_compute`` of ``(12, 0)`` now refuses only
a part newer than sm_120.  The forecast door, the driver, the proof harness and
every tool whose bytes nothing pins no longer pass it; the few call sites
left are the ones a recorded byte pin holds
(``tests/test_arch_admission.py``, ``PINNED_TO_SM120``).
