"""Device-parallel segment scheduler for the partitioned v841 executor (brief-3).

This module is the *assignment policy and barrier machinery* for running the
streamed partition executor across more than one GPU.  It contains no dycore,
no physics and no field arithmetic: it decides which partition runs on which
device, keeps one long-lived worker thread bound to each device, and enforces
the segment barrier that the streamed executor's double-buffer swap depends on.

Model (fixed by brief 3):

* Partitions are split into contiguous ascending blocks, one block per device
  (``P = 16``, ``devices = (0, 1)`` -> ``0..7`` on device 0, ``8..15`` on
  device 1).
* One worker thread per device, created once and bound to its
  ``cupy.cuda.Device`` for its whole life, holding its own per-device resources
  (kernel cache, memory-pool cap).
* Within a segment a worker walks ITS partitions in ascending order, reading
  the shared host ``in`` buffers and scattering owned outputs into the shared
  host ``out`` buffers.  Owned regions are element-disjoint across every
  partition (brief-1 exact cover), so concurrent scatters touch disjoint
  elements and never race.
* After every segment all workers meet a barrier; only then does the *single*
  caller thread swap the buffers.  Truth between segments therefore lives only
  in host global arrays, exactly as in the single-device case.

Because the barrier includes the caller, the swap provably happens after every
partition's scatter and before any partition's next gather.

``serial=True`` runs the identical work in the caller thread, device group by
device group, partitions ascending.  It is the debug arm: results must be
bitwise identical to threaded mode, which is an empirical gate, not an
assumption.

Nothing here imports cupy at module scope, so the assignment law, the barrier
semantics and the manifest/coverage guards are all testable on a CPU-only box.

#: How the per-partition floor is derived, machine-readably.  Rerouted
#: 2026-08-25 (stale-guard audit #347, finding 5): this module used to be a
#: SECOND admission surface -- a 22 GiB whole-mesh constant scaled linearly
#: through the origin with no fixed term, times a 1.25 multiplier, beside a
#: separate 20 GiB ``min_free_bytes`` default -- the exact shape the L6
#: ``NATIVE_DEVICE_FLOOR`` re-derivation retired everywhere else the same
#: day.  A linear floor is UNDER-protective for a partition: every rank's
#: process pays the card's full fixed term (CUDA context, kernel
#: local-memory backing store, module images) no matter how few cells its
#: partition holds, so a floor with no fixed term admits a small partition
#: on a device that cannot even hold the process.  The floor now answers
#: from ``woof.hex.device_admission`` like every other free-memory gate.
#:
#: The per-partition APPLICATION of that measured row is a DECLARED
#: DERIVATION: the row was fitted from whole-mesh single-GPU #264 sessions,
#: and no 2-GPU #264 ledger row exists at the converged pin, so halo-buffer
#: and exchange residency are modeled as inside the whole-mesh slope rather
#: than measured.  The direction is conservative (a partition's local mesh
#: is charged the full whole-mesh per-cell slope plus the full fixed term),
#: and the first real measurement replaces this label.
