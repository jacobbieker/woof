"""One resolution ladder for the Rust engines this package drives.

Nothing in this distribution draws a weather field, interpolates a
meteorological column, or writes an initial condition in Python.  Those
are Rust binaries -- ``rw_mpas_init``, ``rw_mpas_convert``,
``rw_wrfbatch`` -- built from the ``tools/rustwx`` workspace that lives
in the woof repository.  The wheel therefore CANNOT carry them, and a
door that needs one has exactly two states: it found the binary, or it
refuses by name and says what to run.

The reason this module exists rather than a ladder per door: the doors
were each resolving their own way, and one of them was wrong in a way
nobody could see from inside it.  ``pip install woof hex`` pulls
``woof``; ``woof fetch-bridges`` then stages a release's prebuilt
bundle -- and that bundle carries ``rw_mpas_mesh``, ``rw_mpas_static``,
``rw_mpas_init``, ``rw_mpas_convert`` and ``rw_wrfbatch`` -- into
``~/.woof/bridges``.  The init door read one environment variable and
PATH, so a user who had run the one command that installs the engine
still met a refusal telling them to build it with cargo.  A remedy that
ignores the estate the user already has is not a remedy.

THE LADDER, best first, identical for every engine:

1. the door's own command-line flag;
2. this distribution's environment variable, then any legacy spellings
   it has carried (a rename never silently stops reading a variable);
3. woof's own environment variable and its bridge ladder -- a woof
   checkout's ``tools/rustwx/target/{release,debug}``, ``libexec/bridges``
   beside the installed package, the wheel-bundled directory inside it,
   and ``~/.woof/bridges`` where ``woof fetch-bridges`` stages;
4. ``PATH``.

Rungs 1-3 fail LOUDLY when they name a file that is not there.  An
explicit configuration that falls through to a different binary is how a
box runs the wrong engine and reports success, so a named-but-missing
path is a refusal, never a skipped rung.

Rung 3 is read through :mod:`woof.mpas_mesh` when that module can be
imported, so the two ladders cannot drift; when it cannot -- an older
woof, or none at all -- the two directories that do not depend on
woof's internals (``~/.woof/bridges`` and ``libexec/bridges`` beside
the package) are still probed directly, and the refusal names the
version floor instead of pretending the rung does not exist.
