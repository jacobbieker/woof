"""Named forecast presets, as DATA.

A preset is one row naming what a forecast run changes relative to the
proven configuration: which physics suite the column seam runs, and how
often the surface layer, the land-surface model and the PBL are called.
``woof hex forecast --preset NAME`` selects a row; the door turns the row
into the knobs it already has (``--pbl-cadence``), so a preset is never a
code path of its own and adding one is adding a row.

WHAT A PRESET HOLDS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT.  A row holds only choices that
change the forecast.  A change that moves no output byte is not a preset
choice: it is simply on, for every row (the per-step physics rollback
export, which a run declines unless ``--stop-on-refusal`` keeps a refused
step's boundary; see :mod:`woof.hex.cuda_arwen_physics_v841`).  Holding a
free saving behind a preset would make the default slower for no reason.

THE PHYSICS SUITE IS DECLARED, AND CHECKED AGAINST THE ENGINE.  The pinned
engine's column seam (``woof.core.mpas_column_batch``) builds its physics
configuration with the radiation, land-surface and surface-layer
selections written as literals, and publishes no constructor argument for
any of them; the PBL slot is the one argument it takes (``pbl_scheme``),
selected per run by ``--pbl`` rather than by a row (see
:data:`ENGINE_ARGUMENT_SLOTS`).  Every row therefore declares
:data:`ENGINE_COLUMN_SUITE`, and
:func:`resolve_preset` refuses a row that declares anything else.  THE
BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS: a row naming RTE-RRTMGP or Noah would run legacy
RRTMG and Noah-MP while its receipt said otherwise.  When the engine's seam
takes the suite as data, a row naming another suite becomes a table edit
here plus that engine pin, and nothing else.

THE CADENCE IS A HOLD, NOT A NUMBER OF SECONDS FOR EVERY MESH.  A held
cadence must be a whole number of model steps (:mod:`woof.hex.pbl_cadence`
refuses anything else), and the meshes this program runs step at 5 s to
120 s.  A row therefore names the longest hold it accepts, and
:func:`pbl_cadence_request` turns that into the largest whole number of
this mesh's steps that fits inside it: 30 s is six steps at dt 5 s, one
step (the weld) at dt 20 s or longer.  A row never holds the stack longer
than it says.

WHY THE DEFAULT IS ``reference``.  A row becomes the default only when it
scores at least as well against observations as the row it replaces.  The
``fast`` row was graded on four 3 h HRRR-driven forecasts of the 937.5 m
point cull (docs/hex-point-hrrr.md, the forecast presets section): it
takes about 6 per cent less time per step and its reflectivity and
precipitation threshold scores are indistinguishable from ``reference``,
but its near-surface forecast is worse: 10 m wind RMSE against ASOS is
higher on all four cases (0.05 m/s on average, an interval that excludes
zero), 2 m dewpoint and temperature RMSE are higher on three of four, and
hourly precipitation RMSE against Stage-IV is slightly higher.  So it
stays selectable and ``reference`` stays the default.

RTE-RRTMGP, the other physics saving, was measured through this seam as a
measurement arm outside the shipped options (docs/hex-point-hrrr.md): its
radiation call costs about a twentieth of legacy RRTMG's on the point cull.
It becomes a row here once the engine's seam takes the radiation variant
as an argument.
