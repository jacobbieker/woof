"""Runtime mesh rows: a generated mesh registers itself from its own bytes.

THE BLOCKER THIS REMOVES.  ``woof hex forecast`` resolves ``--mesh``
against ``woof.hex.drivers.mpas_mesh_binding.MESH_BINDINGS`` and refuses a name it
does not hold.  Every row in that file was typed by a person after the mesh
existed.  ``woof hex mesh-plan --point`` generates a mesh at a point nobody
typed a row for -- the whole point of the door is that the point is
arbitrary -- so the registry could never hold its row in advance, and a
checkout edit per point would be the hand-written-row-per-swath defect
``woof.hex.cascade_row`` retired for the cascade, wearing a different hat.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS, AND HOW IT DIFFERS FROM ``cascade_row``.  A cascade row
describes a CULL of a row somebody registered, and it insists on that:
lineage stops at a person.  A runtime row describes a mesh the GENERATOR
made from a spec the door wrote, so its lineage stops at the spec and at the
generator's own receipt:

* a ``generated-global`` row names the spec by SHA-256, the generator
  receipt, the static receipt, and the pair's bytes;
* a ``generated-cull`` row names the ``generated-global`` row it was cut
  from (which must be in the same file, or already registered), the cull
  receipt, the region, the boundary-mask digest and the boundary source.

Everything a registry row BUYS is kept, and it is worth restating which
half is a review and which is a measurement (``cascade_row`` says the same):
the bytes are pinned by count and SHA-256 and re-hashed at bind; the
Courant, dual-edge, cell-coordination and regional admissions are
measurements of the files at bind; the timestep is refused unless an anchor
covers the configuration; the regional forecast opener re-measures the class
key and requires a contract deck on THESE rings.  None of those become
weaker because the row was written by the door that generated the mesh.
What is genuinely lost is a person reading the row; what stands in for that
is the door's own admission pass on the pair it just built (dual edge, cell
coordination, Courant at the declared timestep), recorded in the row file
and refused at write time when it fails.

WHAT THIS MODULE REFUSES, by name:

* a name that collides with a shipped registry row (a runtime row may never
  shadow one);
* a cull row whose parent is neither in the same file nor registered;
* a row whose declared bytes do not match the files on disk now;
* a cull row carrying a boundary zone and no ``lbc_source``;
* a file that is not a ``gpuwm-hex.mesh-rows/v1`` document.

Rows are supplied through a FILE, like cascade rows, because the forecast
door runs the driver in another process.  ``woof.hex.drivers.mpas_mesh_binding``
applies them where it builds ``MESH_BINDINGS`` -- before the cascade rows,
so a cascade may cull a generated parent -- and the door's by-path
re-execution of that module picks them up as the first copy did.  The file
is named by ``$WOOF_HEX_MESH_ROWS`` (``os.pathsep``-separated when there
are several) and, by convention, lives beside the mesh it describes as
``mesh-rows.json``.
