"""``woof hex pair`` -- one authored forecast, run twice, differenced.

WHAT THIS DOOR IS FOR, and it is not convenience.

A question of the form *"what did the model do differently when this point
source table was applied?"* is answered by two runs, and the answer is only
worth reading when the two runs differ in ONE thing.  Every part of that is
easy to get wrong by hand: two configuration files drift, one leg picks up a
stale kernel cache from the other, the two output trees land beside each
other with no record of which was which, and the difference that comes out is
attributed to the treatment when it was really a differing timestep, a
differing mixing lane or a differing init.

THE BREAKAGE THIS DOOR PREVENTS is exactly that: a difference published
against a control that was never the same experiment.  So:

* **There is ONE authored request.**  The user writes the forecast argument
  vector once, on this command line, and adds ``--source-table``.  The
  treatment leg is that vector plus the table; the control leg is that vector
  with the table absent.  The control is DERIVED.  There is no second
  configuration to keep in step, because there is no second configuration.
* **The derivation is re-proved rather than trusted.**
  :func:`assert_pair_identity` reads both argument vectors back as tokens and
  refuses unless they differ in exactly ``--source-table`` and the per-leg
  destinations.  Every other differing token is NAMED.  A derivation that
  cannot be checked is a derivation nobody has to keep correct.
* **The legs run through the forecast door**, as subprocesses, in the order
  control then treatment.  This door reimplements no part of the model, no
  part of admission and no part of the receipt: it drives the same front door
  a user drives, so a pair cannot be running a configuration the single door
  would have refused.
* **Both trees are fresh and separate.**  ``--pair-out`` must be empty, and
  each leg gets its own output tree and its own kernel cache derived the way
  the forecast door derives its own defaults, so neither leg can read the
  other's temporaries.

WHAT THE OUTPUT IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT.  ``summary.txt`` opens with the
sentence this door exists to keep attached to its own numbers: a difference
between the two legs is a MODEL RESULT.  It states what this model did when
the table was present.  It is not a measurement of the atmosphere and it is
not evidence that the atmosphere would have done the same.  The manifest
carries digests so a reader can check that the numbers came from the files
they name; nothing here makes a claim about the world.

This module is stdlib-only at import.  numpy and netCDF4 are pulled inside
the summary, so ``woof hex pair --help`` and every argument refusal work on
a box with no scientific stack at all.
