"""Published MPAS mesh loading and topology/geometry validation.

MPAS writes connectivity as one-based indices with zero denoting a missing
entry.  The authority representation in this package is zero-based with
``-1`` padding.  Padding is canonicalized from the corresponding count field
because some otherwise-valid MPAS mesh files repeat the final used entry in
unused ``cellsOnCell`` and ``edgesOnCell`` slots.

The topology conventions checked here are the conventions consumed by
``atm_compute_signs`` in frozen MPAS-A v8.2.3:
``src/core_atmosphere/mpas_atm_core.F:1137-1224``.  The metric relationships
are the MPAS C-grid discretization represented by the mesh-spec fields.

A REGIONAL (limited-area) mesh -- a bounded disk culled from a parent sphere,
carrying the ``bdyMaskCell/Edge/Vertex`` triple WITH A NONEMPTY BOUNDARY ZONE
-- is validated against the conventions measured on native
MPAS-Limited-Area culls of two published meshes (2026-08-25, real bytes,
both culls 100 percent).  The zone, not the schema, is what makes a mesh
regional: native MPAS-A writes the same triple all-zero into a GLOBAL mesh's
static file and the unified ``rw_mpas_static`` follows that convention on
every static this project generates, so classifying on presence alone refused
both the published x1.40962 and every generated global mesh as a corrupt cull
(measured 2026-08-26; see :meth:`Mesh.validate`).  The conventions:

* masks are integers 0 (interior) through 7 (outermost ring), edge/vertex
  masks are the MINIMUM of their present cells' masks, neighbouring cell
  masks never differ by more than 1, and every ring-``k`` cell touches at
  least one ring-``k-1`` cell.  That last one used to be "ring populations
  grow outward", which holds on a uniform mesh and fails on a variable-
  resolution one -- see :func:`regional_ring_shell_errors` for the three
  culls that measured it;
* absent-element sentinels (file zeros, canonical ``-1``) appear only on
  ring-7 elements and only in the five arrays of
  :data:`REGIONAL_SENTINEL_ARRAYS`; every other connectivity array is
  complete because the cull keeps every edge and vertex of a kept cell
  (``nEdgesOnEdge`` is NOT shrunk -- sentinels sit inside the declared row);
* the Euler characteristic ``nCells - nEdges + nVertices`` is 1 (a disk),
  not the closed sphere's 2, and the whole-sphere area identities do not
  apply -- the local kite/area identities and the arc-length checks still do.

Carrying the triple is NOT what makes a mesh regional; carrying a boundary
ZONE is.  MPAS writes an all-zero ``bdyMask`` triple on a global mesh (every
element interior, no ring at all), and the unified ``rw_mpas_static`` writer
follows that convention, so every static this project GENERATES ships the
triple.  Presence alone therefore classified a closed sphere as a disk and
refused it for having Euler characteristic 2 and empty rings 1..7 -- which is
exactly what a global mesh is.  MEASURED 2026-08-26 on the generated graded
mesh ``v20.80.151649``: bound clean, then refused at load by that rule, as
would every generated-static row (``u96.64002``, every graded row).  The test
is a NONZERO mask value, and it is the whole difference; an INCOMPLETE triple
stays refused on presence, because a half-written triple cannot say which
sentinels are boundary and which are corruption.

    ring-``k-1`` neighbour is forced from a ring that does not touch it, and
    the boundary blend has a hole nothing announces.

    THIS REPLACES A TEST THAT DID NOT IMPLY ITS OWN CLAIM, and the counter-
    example is measured (2026-08-27, the proving RTX 5090, evidence/nest-ratio-20260827/).
    The check here used to be that ring POPULATIONS grow outward, on the
    stated reasoning that "each ring wraps the previous in a growing shell".
    Populations are a proxy for wrapping on a UNIFORM mesh only, and the only
    meshes this program culls are variable resolution.  Three culls of one
    parent, one binary, one run -- one of them byte-identical to the
    registered ``r4.75.11020`` -- were handed to the old check and two were
    refused:

    ======  ==============================  ==============================
    cull    ring cell counts 1..7           ring mean cell width, km
    ======  ==============================  ==============================
    d045    207 209 212 215 218 217 225     5.03 -> 5.49
    d070    254 251 249 242 241 237 232     6.31 -> 7.71
    d100    240 245 251 257 263 269 275     8.99 -> 9.65
    ======  ==============================  ==============================

    ``d070``'s rings grow outward into the parent's coarsening ramp: each ring
    is 2.9 per cent wider than the one inside it, so the shell's PERIMETER
    grows 11.6 per cent over the seven rings while its POPULATION falls 8.7
    per cent.  Fewer, larger cells wrapping a larger circumference is not a
    tear.  The arithmetic is exact -- with a perimeter of ``P`` cells, one ring
    outward gives ``(P + 2*pi) / (1 + g)`` for a fractional width growth ``g``,
    which shrinks whenever ``g > 2*pi/P`` -- so on any cull big enough to
    matter, a few per cent of grading per ring inverts the old test.

    Every one of the three satisfies the property asserted here, and so does
    every native cull the conventions were measured on.  The claims the old
    test was reaching for are kept and are checked elsewhere: no empty ring,
    neighbouring masks never differing by more than one, and Euler
    characteristic 1.

    The comparison has two independent error sources and a purely relative
    bound can only express one of them.

    * The stored length rounds to its own storage precision.  That is a
      RELATIVE error and ``metric_rtol`` carries it.
    * The Cartesian coordinates the arc is recomputed FROM are quantized at
      the sphere radius, and that error does not shrink with the edge.  At
      binary32 and Earth radius the coordinate spacing is
      ``np.spacing(float32(6371220.0)) == 0.5`` metres whether the edge is
      8 km or 800 km long, so it is an ABSOLUTE floor.

    Deriving the floor: each of an endpoint's three components rounds by at
    most half a coordinate spacing, bounding the endpoint's displacement by
    ``sqrt(3)/2`` spacings; the two endpoints of an edge can move in opposite
    directions along it, so the arc carries at most ``sqrt(3)`` spacings.  The
    factor of two on top carries a mesh whose coordinates were rounded a
    second time -- :func:`load_precision_preserving_mesh_pair` rescales them
    between two sphere radii, which is exactly that second rounding.

    Without the floor a defect-free mesh is refused for its own storage
    precision: at 8.7 km vertex spacing the quantization alone is ~1e-5 of the
    edge, which sits on top of a 2.0e-5 relative bound and makes admission a
    coin flip.  With the floor named, the relative half no longer has to
    stand in for it, so it is capped at what binary32 storage actually needs
    (``8 * eps`` ~ 9.5e-7) rather than the 2.0e-5 that let metre-scale
    corruption hide at coarse spacing.
