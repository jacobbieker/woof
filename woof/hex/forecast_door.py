"""The forecast front door: an init and a registered mesh in, history out.

``woof hex forecast`` is the user-reachable command over the same execution
path the measurement harness drives.  It does not reimplement the model: it
binds a REGISTERED mesh through ``src/hexcore/drivers/mpas_mesh_binding.py``, hands the
bound shape to ``src/hexcore/drivers/run_cuda_v841_forecast.py`` -- whose ``execute_forecast``
is the one integration loop this project has -- and owns everything a
measurement harness deliberately does not:

* fail-closed argument resolution, with every refusal naming the wrong
  result it prevents and the command that fixes it;
* device-memory ADMISSION before CUDA is touched, against memory measured at
  the moment of the decision;
* destination discipline (the run's scratch never lands inside its output);
* one run receipt that states what ran, what it claims, and the exact
  ``woof hex render`` command that consumes the output.

WHY ADMISSION IS THE POINT OF THIS DOOR.  The driver's floor and this door
answer from ONE surface, ``woof.hex.device_admission``: the same measured
affine row, the same headroom, the same :func:`required_free_bytes` sum.
Before that surface existed the driver held a separate linear floor scaled
from an asserted 24 GiB constant, which on the published 40,962-cell mesh
admitted at about 6.0 GiB free while the measured peak was 9,948 MiB -- a
card between those numbers passed the floor, spent minutes loading a mesh
and compiling kernels, and then died inside a CuPy allocation part-way
through a run.  That is the concrete breakage this gate prevents.  When the
door admits on a card's OWN measured row it forwards the same requirement to
the driver (``--required-free-bytes``), so the two gates cannot disagree.

WHY THE MODEL IS NOT A FROZEN BUDGET.  Free device memory is read from the
driver at the moment of the decision, never carried from a previous run or a
previous card, because the memory a desktop session is already holding is
part of the answer.  The fitted row is a measurement with a provenance
string, and a card whose own ledger has been run supplies its own row with
``--device-fixed-mib`` / ``--device-bytes-per-cell``.

This module is stdlib-only at import.  numpy, netCDF4 and cupy are pulled
inside the handlers that need them, so ``woof hex --help`` and every
argument refusal work on a box with no CUDA lane at all.
