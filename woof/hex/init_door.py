"""The init front door: native-free construction or explicit capsule compatibility.

The Rust ``rw_mpas_init`` engine continues to own meteorological interpolation
and state construction.  This door owns fail-closed argument resolution,
construction of the vertical artifact when requested, compatibility-capsule
preflight, and provenance.

Normal native-free mode is:

``grid + static + WPS met + versioned vertical JSON -> constructed artifact -> rw_mpas_init``

The generated artifact is passed through the engine's existing capsule/reference
ABI as both arguments.  A native init file is opened only when the caller
explicitly selects compatibility mode with ``--capsule`` and ``--reference``.
