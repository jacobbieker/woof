"""GPU-native variable-resolution atmospheric model core.

A CUDA port of the MPAS-Atmosphere v8.4.1 dynamical core, with a NumPy CPU
authority beside it for the operators that are verified against
source-extracted fixtures.

Evidence is component- and configuration-specific; this package does not make
a package-wide numerical-equivalence, production-physics, or GPU claim.
Modules carry their own frozen-source citations and exact refusal boundaries.
