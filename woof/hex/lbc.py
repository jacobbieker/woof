"""Lateral-boundary-condition files: the reader and the two-level pool.

The producer side of this seam is ``rw_mpas_lbc`` (and, for reference mints,
native ``init_atmosphere_model`` case 9): one CDF-5 file per boundary time,
each carrying FULL-MESH fields, ``lbc_u`` over every edge, the cell fields
over every cell, regardless of how few of those elements the consuming model
will read.  This module is the consumer's first half, a transcription of the
admission and timekeeping in ``mpas_atm_boundaries.F`` (MPAS v8.4.1):

* **admission**: the first admitted file is the LATEST file at-or-before
  the model time (``MPAS_STREAM_LATEST_BEFORE``); every subsequent one is the
  EARLIEST file STRICTLY after it (``MPAS_STREAM_EARLIEST_STRICTLY_AFTER``).
  A missing interval refuses by name: which rule, which model time, what the
  inventory actually holds.
* **the two-level pool**: level 2 holds the state read at the current
  interval's END; level 1 holds the TENDENCY ``(new - old) / dt`` computed in
  float32 exactly as the Fortran computes it (``dt`` formed in REAL(4), then
  reciprocal-multiplied).
* **time interpolation**, the state at model time ``t`` inside an interval
  is ``state(end) - (end - t) * tendency``: linear, anchored BACKWARD from
  the interval end, which is ``mpas_atm_get_bdy_state`` verbatim.

What this module deliberately does NOT do: derive the coupled fields
(``lbc_rho_zz = lbc_rho / zz``, edge-averaged ``lbc_rho_edge``, ``lbc_ru``,
``lbc_rtheta_m``) or touch the integration loop.  Those need mesh state and
live in :class:`woof.hex.regional_v841.RegionalDrivingState`, which wraps
this pool and computes them at every admission exactly as
``mpas_atm_update_bdy_tend`` does; the pool stays generic over field names
so that wrapper carries derived fields beside the file fields without this
module growing a mesh dependency.
