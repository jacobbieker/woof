"""``woof hex mesh-plan`` -- ask a resolution spec every question before building.

WHY THIS DOOR EXISTS.  ``mesh-check`` validates a mesh that already exists.
Until this leg there was nothing to ask about a mesh that does NOT exist yet,
so the only way to find out whether a spec was buildable was to build it --
and ``rw_mpas_mesh --dry-run``, the thing that looks like the answer, sizes
without applying the build's gates.  Measured 2026-08-28 on this desktop:
one design sized clean and was refused 87 ms later by the build's pre-run
arithmetic; a second sized clean, cleared that gate, relaxed 217,621 cells
over **1,251 s** and was then refused on the 200 m shortest-dual-edge floor
at edge 562175 (36.8 m over an 886 m dcEdge), with no grid written.  The
report that opened this lane measured the same pair at 711 s on another box.

``--point LAT,LON`` (:mod:`woof.hex.mesh_point`) writes the spec itself --
the registered 937.5 m ladder moved to the point -- prices its CULL against
the named card on the one admission surface, and with ``--generate``
builds, admits, registers (a runtime row beside the mesh) and culls it.

This leg costs about a fifth of a second and answers three things:

* what the spec costs -- cells, and the device footprint when a card is named;
* every gate the build applies that a SPEC decides, applied here, so a spec
  the build would refuse is refused here first, with the remedy in numbers;
* every gate the build applies that a spec does NOT decide, named, with the
  quantities that decide it and the earliest point at which it can be known.

The third list is not an apology.  A sizing path that silently omits a gate
is how a user spends twenty minutes to learn something; a sizing path that
says which gate it cannot evaluate, and why, spends nothing.
