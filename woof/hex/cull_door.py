"""``woof hex cull`` -- cut a limited-area case out of a global one.

WHY THIS DOOR EXISTS, and it is not convenience.

``woof hex init`` cannot build a limited-area initial condition, and the
refusal it raises is correct: ``vertical.py``'s closed-sphere authority meets
a ring-7 one-cell edge and says *"the closed-sphere vertical authority does
not invent exterior state"*.  A limited-area domain has cells whose
neighbours are outside it, and a vertical grid built by a routine that
assumes every edge has two cells would be inventing the atmosphere on the
other side.

The native answer is to run ``init_atmosphere_model`` with
``config_init_case=7`` and ``config_blend_bdy_terrain=YES``, which puts
Fortran back in the chain -- and the 2.5.0 Python/Rust boundary does not
admit that.

THE ANSWER THIS DOOR SHIPS, measured by the swath-as-lam lane on 2026-08-26:
**cull the parent's own init.**  ``rw_mpas_mesh --cull-parent`` subsets any
classic-netCDF file that carries the mesh dimensions, record variables
included, so the same region row that cuts the grid cuts the static and the
init as well.  Culling took **one second**; building the PARENT's own
init with ``woof hex init`` took **775 s** on the 121,182-cell parent
``v4.75.121182`` (2026-08-26, evidence/swath-real-cascade-20260826).
No native regional init has been timed, so this is OUR cost against OUR
cost, not a comparison against native.  It was previously written as a
native regional init, and it is better than the native route rather than
merely faster:

* the child's terrain IS the parent's terrain, cell for cell, so
  ``blend_bdy_terrain`` has nothing to blend and there is no terrain seam to
  make -- the seam is removed by construction, not smoothed;
* the child's vertical grid IS the parent's, so the two runs start
  bit-identical on every cell they share and a limited-area forecast can be
  compared with its parent EXACTLY rather than approximately;
* no vertical authority is asked to invent exterior state, so the refusal
  above never has to be relaxed.

The one thing a cull does not carry is lineage: ``rw_mpas_mesh
--cull-parent`` byte-matches MPAS-Limited-Area v2.2, and that tool writes
exactly ``on_a_sphere`` and ``sphere_radius`` into the regional file.
``rw_mpas_lbc`` reads twelve global attributes off its ``--grid`` and refuses
rather than invent one, so this door carries the parent's own attributes onto
the child before it hands anything on.
