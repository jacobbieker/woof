"""Certification spine: what a run compiled, what it ran on, what it wrote.

The package carries one schema (``gpuwm.certification-capsule/v1``), one
builder, and one loader, so every route that finishes a forecast records the
same evidence in the same shape.  Nothing here imports a case module: the
certification path must stay generic or the receipt describes the case that
happened to exercise it rather than the model.

#: Every function in this package that can make certification REFUSE.
#:
#: Declared, rather than inferred, because the defect this list exists to
#: prevent is invisible to every other kind of test: a validator that is
#: written, exported and unit-tested, and that the command never calls.
#: ``compile_platform_fingerprint``, ``describe_drift`` and
#: ``manifest_is_empty`` were exactly that through 2.3.3, so ``woof
#: certify`` printed PASS over NVRTC drift and over a capsule whose kernel
#: manifest recorded nothing.
#:
#: ``tests/test_certify_reachability.py`` holds every name here to being
#: reachable from ``woof certify``, ``woof dual-run`` or the capsule
#: emission path by walking this package's call graph, and separately
#: requires that any validator-shaped function be listed -- so neither
#: half can be forgotten without a red test.
