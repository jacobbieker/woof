"""``woof certify`` and ``woof dual-run``, both fail-closed.

Registered from :mod:`woof.cli` before the ``--explain`` sweep, so both
commands carry the same layering convention every other subcommand does.
Neither command has a ``--force``, a ``--warn-only`` or a tolerance flag: the
band is data, the refusals are the band's and the capsule's, and a reader who
wants a different answer edits the band and says so in its provenance.
