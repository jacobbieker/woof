"""Identity of the toolchain that turns this project's ``.cu`` sources into SASS.

Every acceptance gate stated in ULP against a Fortran oracle is a measurement
of *the compiled kernel*, not of the source.  The source is pinned by
:mod:`woof.certify.kernel_manifest` (``source_sha256``); this module pins the
other half -- which compiler produced the image the numbers were measured on.

Why it exists.  On 2026-08-04 this project's kernel compiler changed underneath
a certified table without a single tracked input moving: ``cupy`` 14.0.1,
``numpy`` 2.2.6, CPython 3.13.7 and the display driver were all still on their
pinned versions, and the ``.cu`` file was byte-identical, yet the Shin-Hong
CUDA column's distance from WRF moved on two fields.  The mover was NVRTC:
CuPy had been resolving the system CUDA v13.0 toolkit (NVRTC/ptxas 13.0.48)
and, once ``nvidia-cuda-nvrtc-cu12`` 12.9.86 appeared in ``site-packages``, it
resolved that instead.  The published pin row for that item reported only
``nvrtc.getVersion()`` -- ``(12, 9)`` -- which cannot separate 12.9.41 from
12.9.86, and the failure surfaced as a bare number mismatch with no named
cause.  What follows is the missing resolution.

Nothing here needs a device: NVRTC compiles an empty translation unit without
one, and the reported build string is exactly what CuPy folds into its own
kernel-cache key, so it is the same discriminator the cache already trusts.

Every item carries a status, the same contract :mod:`woof.certify.pins` uses:
``resolved`` means something measured it in this process, ``unavailable``
means nothing did and says why.  A fingerprint is never filled with a
plausible value.
