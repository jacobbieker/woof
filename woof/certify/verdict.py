"""The certification verdict: every refusal, in one place, fail-closed.

``woof certify`` takes a run capsule, a matched-comparison metrics CSV, an
acceptance band and a WRF reference manifest, and returns 0 only when every
declared condition holds.  Each condition is evaluated whether or not an
earlier one already failed, so a reader gets the whole list rather than the
first refusal and a rerun.

The verdict binds itself.  ``capsule_binding_sha256`` covers the closed
inventory of everything the decision rests on -- and deliberately not the
``passed`` boolean, so flipping that bit is inert: the hash does not move, and
:func:`rederive_verdict` still returns what the bound rows say.  Mutating a
bound row moves both.

The binding mirrors the score-binding shape the case lane already uses; it
does not import it.  Importing would put a case module on the certification
import path -- both the binding function and the canonical-JSON digest beside
it live on case modules -- so this module carries its own digest, under its
own name, and a test holds the import graph to that.
