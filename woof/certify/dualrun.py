"""``woof dual-run``: two capsules, one answer, and the field that broke it.

The 5090 has no ECC.  A dual run is how this project detects the corruption
the card cannot report: run the same configuration twice and compare the two
receipts field for field.  The comparison is total -- there is no ignore list,
because every field a comparison skips is a field a silent flip can hide in --
and it is ordered, so "the first divergent field" is a property of the two
documents rather than of dictionary iteration order.

The same command is what compares the trajectory-digest instrumentation's
on and off arms: two capsules from the same short window, one with the digest
enabled, and a divergence anywhere outside the digest itself is a finding.

The one place the comparison is not literal is where a field records WHERE a
run wrote rather than WHAT it computed.  Two runs of one configuration must
write to different directories -- otherwise they overwrite each other -- so a
literal comparison of the absolute output paths made a clean verdict
unreachable for every control pair, which is the opposite of what this
command is for.  Those fields are NORMALIZED to the leaf name and still
compared: a run that wrote the wrong domain, the wrong valid time or the
wrong number of frames still diverges, and nothing is skipped.  Every byte
that carries physics -- the per-frame SHA-256 set, the trajectory digest, the
pins, the kernel manifest, the input bytes -- is compared verbatim.

Because the comparison is total, it is also vacuous on nothing, and that was
a hole: handed two empty capsules the command found no divergence and said
so.  The screen now refuses a comparison with no leaves in it
(:data:`MINIMUM_COMPARED_LEAVES`) and states how many quantities it compared
when it passes, so "identical" is a claim with a size attached to it.
