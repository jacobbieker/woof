"""The pinned numerical environment, one entry per published pin.

``docs/public/DETERMINISM.md`` section 3 states which parts of the stack must
be identical between two runs for a byte comparison to mean what the document
says it means.  That table is the contract; this module is its machine-readable
twin.  Two of the published rows name two things each -- the CuPy version and
``CUPY_ACCELERATORS``, and the netCDF4 and HDF5 versions -- so eleven rows carry
thirteen items, and each item is resolved and reported separately.

Every item is emitted with a status.  ``resolved`` means something measured it
in this process; ``unavailable`` means nothing did, and carries the reason.  A
pin is never omitted and never filled with a plausible value: refusing an
unresolved pin is the certification command's job, and it can only do that job
if the receipt admits which pins went unmeasured.
