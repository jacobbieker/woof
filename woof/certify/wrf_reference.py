"""The WRF reference manifest, and the precondition that it be complete.

A matched-run comparison is a claim about two binaries on the same case.  The
capsule witnesses one of them.  This module is the other half: which WRF
executable produced the reference stream, from which build recipe, under which
namelists, and with which output bytes.  Certification refuses to proceed while
any of those four hashes is absent -- not because the missing hash is likely to
be wrong, but because a verdict that did not know what it was compared against
is not a verdict.

The manifests themselves live under ``docs/public/wrf-reference/`` (the WRF
side of the comparison is documentation the reader can act on; the reference
wrfouts and the ERA5 inputs are not redistributable and only their hashes
appear).  The refusal below is unconditional code and does not depend on any
manifest having been committed yet.
