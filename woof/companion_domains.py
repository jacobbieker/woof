def physics_components():

    THE COUPLINGS ARE PART OF THE ANSWER.  The registry already carries
    every pairing law as table data -- ``requires_components`` says which
    sibling option an option needs (MYJ needs the Eta surface layer, and
    the Eta layer needs MYJ), ``refused_when`` says which combination is
    refused outright -- and two engine doors read it,
    woof.physics_registry.validate_physics_plan and
    woof.physics_compat.validate_physics_capabilities.  This payload
    dropped both, so a panel built on it could show a scheme with no way
    to say what it must be paired with; the reader met the pairing law
    only as a refusal after choosing.  Forwarded verbatim, from the same
    table those doors read, so a front end cannot invent a second
    vocabulary for one law -- and a pairing added to the registry
    reaches the panel with no code change here.

    ``refused_when`` is filtered through
    :func:`woof.physics_registry._conditional_refusals`, the same filter
    the validator applies, so a malformed rule is dropped in one place
    rather than reaching a caller that would render it.  Couplings key
    off ``registry_option_id``: the ``ra_rrtmg_variant`` fan-out gives one
    registry option several ids here, and every one of them carries the
    registry option's couplings.
