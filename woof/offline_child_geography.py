"""A downscaled child on its own static geography (engine item E3).

``woof downscale`` used to run every child on its PARENT's terrain,
interpolated: a 1 km child of a 3 km parent integrated 3 km ridges at 1 km
spacing and never saw the passes and canyons it existed to resolve.  This
module gives the child what WRF's own one-way offline nesting gives it.
WRF's ``ndown`` (main/ndown_em.F, v4.7.1) takes the fine grid's static
geography from that grid's own ``real.exe`` file (``wrfndi_d02``),
interpolates the coarse history onto the fine grid, blends the two terrains
across the boundary zone (``blend_terrain``, :628) and rebalances every
frame onto the blended terrain (``rebalance_driver``, :710), the initial
state and every boundary frame alike.  The pieces here are those steps:

* :func:`child_projected_grid` places the child on the parent's projection
  with WPS's nest arithmetic, and checks the parent's own coordinates agree
  with the projection rebuilt from its attributes before anything is built
  on it.
* :func:`build_child_geography` builds the child's static fields with the
  engine's own static builder at the child's spacing (the Rust
  ``static_fields`` crate, the same build a standalone run of that grid
  makes): terrain, land use, soil category, climatologies, and the terrain
  smoothing, high-resolution terrain or land cover and urban legend the
  child's ``[static]`` table asks for.
* :func:`blend_child_terrain` is WRF's ``blend_terrain``
  (dyn_em/nest_init_utils.F:712-785) on the child's own edges: the
  specified and relaxation rows keep the parent's interpolated terrain, the
  next ``blend_width`` rows blend, the interior is the child's own.
* :func:`rebalance_to_child_terrain` is WRF's ndown ``rebalance``
  (dyn_em/module_initialize_real.F:4982-5266): the analytic base state on
  the blended terrain, potential temperature shifted by the base-state
  difference between the two terrains at each terrain-following level, the
  column's dry-mass perturbation kept, and the pressure and geopotential
  perturbations integrated hydrostatically down and up the new column.
* :func:`surface_on_child_geography` puts the parent's land-surface STATE on
  the child's own land use with WRF's masked interpolator
  (``interp_mask_field``, the Registry operator for the soil family) and
  moves skin and soil temperature to the child's terrain with real.exe's
  ``adjust_soil_temp_new`` lapse.

A child on its PARENT's terrain is still available
(:data:`CHILD_TERRAIN_PARENT`, ``woof downscale --parent-terrain``); it is
what every child ran before this module existed, byte for byte.
