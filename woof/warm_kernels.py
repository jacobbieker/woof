"""`woof warm-kernels`: pay the first run's kernel compile up front.

A fresh runtime's first forecast compiles its GPU kernels for the local
card before model step 1 can finish -- measured 2026-09-24 at about two
minutes and 157 kernel cache entries on an RTX 5070 Ti -- and the
screen says little while it happens.  CuPy keeps what it compiles in its
on-disk kernel cache (:func:`woof.kernel_compile_notice.
cupy_kernel_cache_dir`), so the cost is paid once per card.  This door
pays it on purpose, at a time the user chooses, and reports what it did:
how many kernels were compiled into the cache and how long it took.

HOW THE SET IS CHOSEN.  The kernels a forecast compiles depend on its
physics, so the door does not keep a list of them.  It runs the forecast
code itself: for each physics profile it builds a small synthetic domain
(a flat, moist, resting column over land), attaches that profile's
physics through the same :func:`woof.core.physics.initialize_physics`
a forecast calls, and advances it two model steps with the production
:func:`woof.core.dycore.step`.  Whatever that compiles is what a
forecast with that physics compiles.  By default the profiles are the
ones the sources default to (:func:`woof.physics_menu.
default_profile_for`), so a plain first forecast finds its kernels
cached; ``--profile`` names others and ``--all-profiles`` takes every
shipped suite.

What it does not reach: kernels only a real case uses (terrain, lateral
boundaries, output diagnostics) still compile on the first real run, and
a run at a vertical level count above a kernel's compiled ceiling adds
its own tier.  Those are seconds, not minutes.
