"""WRF v4.6.1 MYNN boundary-layer cloud merge for radiation.

``module_radiation_driver.F:1403-1429`` diagnoses grid-scale cloud fraction
first, then applies ``icloud_bl``.  After the first model timestep it replaces
the diagnosed fraction with the carried MYNN ``CLDFRA_BL`` field.  On every
timestep it adds ``QC_BL`` or ``QI_BL`` only where the corresponding
grid-scale condensate is below WRF's threshold and ``CLDFRA_BL > 0.001``.

Radiation runs before PBL in WRF and woof, so the fields presented here are
the previous interval's carried MYNN state.  This module does not advance or
re-diagnose them.
