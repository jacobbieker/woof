"""Grell-Freitas cumulus adapter: the ``cu_physics=3`` engine callable.

The scheme itself is ``woof/core/kernels/gf.cu`` -- the whole of WRF
v4.6.1's GFDRV per column, held at max_ulp 0 against the byte-frozen
oracle by ``tests/test_gf_gfdrv_cuda.py`` with ``fzu`` PINNED from that
capture.  ``fzu`` is pinned because gamma is a DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE from
WRF since 2.7.0 -- WOOF's is correctly rounded and glibc's, which
gfortran binds WRF's ``gamma()`` intrinsic to, is not
(docs/gf_gamma_known_delta.md).  THIS adapter does not pin: the shipped
forecast computes the correctly rounded value, the three override slots
stay 0, and the pin exists only for column-by-column comparison against a
WRF capture.  This module is only the seam: it packs the engine's column state into the
kernel's input layout, launches ``gf_gfdrv_stage`` over every column, and
returns the driver's Task-1 :class:`~woof.core.physics.CumulusResult`
(rates held until the next due call, RAINCV consumed once per due call --
GF has no NCA persistence; WRF recomputes it every STEPCU step, and the
importer pins ``cudt = 0`` for ``cu_physics=3`` so STEPCU is 1, exactly
WRF's usual GF configuration).

The kernel runs the SHIPPED identity: corrected k22 indexing
(``k22_wrf_faithful = 0``).  The WRF-faithful off-by-one is reachable only
through the parity suites, never from here; the measured ledger for the
difference is tests/test_gf_shallow_cuda.py::
test_the_corrected_k22_ledger_entry (three fixture cases move, all three
rejected either way, zero output words differ).

Recorded deviations of THIS seam (the kernel behind it is bitwise; these
are about what the engine can hand it today):

1. **Forcing tendencies** (CLOSED, task #243).  GFDRV's forced states
   (``tn``/``qo``) sum advective (RTHFTEN/RQVFTEN), radiative (RTHRATEN)
   and boundary-layer (RTHBLTEN/RQVBLTEN) forcing, and all four auxiliary
   lanes are read off the bound driver:
   ``gf_rthdynten``/``gf_rqvdynten`` (the integrator's advective rates --
   the ARW dycore exports them at RK stage 1 of every step into
   ``state.rthften``/``state.rqvften``, bound at driver construction; the
   MPAS driver computes its own exactly as native v8.4.1's
   mpas_atm_time_integration.F:6936 + :2789 construction) and
   ``gf_rthblten``/``gf_rqvblten`` (the PBL slot's raw rates, retained by
   ``PhysicsDriver._couple_pbl_slot`` under WRF's between-calls
   persistence contract -- YSU, MYJ, MYNN, Shin-Hong and SASE all fill
   the slot on the same terms, exactly as WRF's cumulus driver reads
   RTHBLTEN/RQVBLTEN without asking which scheme wrote them).  A lane
   whose driver attribute is ``None`` feeds zeros -- what a driverless
   adapter and the parity harnesses get.

   THE ADVECTIVE LANE IS PURE ADVECTION, deliberately.
   ``module_cumulus_driver.F:867`` pre-folds ``RTHRATEN + RTHBLTEN`` into
   ``RTHFTEN`` for G3SCHEME and NTIEDTKESCHEME only; GFSCHEME is not in
   that list because the kernel sums the three lanes itself at
   ``kernels/gf.cu:4428``.  Handing this adapter a pre-folded RTHFTEN
   would integrate the boundary layer and the sky twice.
2. **Convective momentum tendencies.**  The kernel computes GF's
   dudt/dvdt; :class:`CumulusResult` carries no momentum slots, so they
   are not yet coupled.  WRF couples them; MPAS-A v8.4.1 does NOT
   (its cu_grell_freitas call carries no rucuten/rvcuten), so for the
   MPAS seam this is native parity, not a gap.
3. **w on mass levels** is the KF-precedent average
   ``0.5*(w[k] + w[k+1])`` of the staggered field.
4. **dx** is per-column when the driver carries ``gf_dx_column``
   ([ny, nx], metres); the scalar ``cfg.dx`` otherwise.  WRF's own GFDRV
   takes dx(i,j), so the per-column feed is the WRF interface, not an
   extension.

Ice routing follows WRF's own ``F_QI`` gate: with a prognostic ``qi`` the
258 K split routes cold condensate to RQICUTEN; without one, everything
lands in RQCCUTEN (module_cu_gf_wrfdrv.F:810-840 with F_QI false), which
is exact here because the split routes one number to one of two slots.
