"""Device-resident P3 (``mp_physics`` 50/51): compilation, residency, launch.

This module is the CUDA half of the P3 port.  ``woof/core/p3.py`` keeps the
CPU float32 transcription as the explicit reference/debug path; everything
here runs on the card and leaves the prognostic state THERE.

WHAT RUNS WHERE
---------------
On the device, every timestep: the whole of ``p3_main`` and the WRF
wrapper's precipitation conversions, over prognostic fields that never
leave the card, against lookup tables uploaded once per process.
On the host, once per process: ``p3_init`` -- the SHA-256-validated table
parse and the generated rain tables (``woof/core/p3_tables.py``).  That is
a startup cost, not a per-step one.
On the host, per step: nothing but kernel launches.  There is no
host round trip of any prognostic field, no per-column Python loop and no
transpose, because the kernels address woof's native ``(nz, ny, nx)``
storage directly as ``(nk, ncol)``.

LAYOUT, AND WHY
---------------
The reference uses one thread per column. The level arms divide the
independent process updates among four threads per column, with adjacent
x threads still reading adjacent columns. Column flags are combined with
integer OR. The sedimentation level arm also divides each substep among
four threads: it reduces the Courant maximum, completes all fluxes, then
updates levels. Floating point sums retain their original order.

Fields stay LEVEL-MAJOR -- element (k, i) at ``k * ncol + i`` -- so a warp
reading level k touches 32 consecutive floats.  That is fully coalesced AND
it is already how a woof ``DomainState`` stores a 3-D field, so the port
adds no transpose anywhere.  The alternative (column-contiguous, which is
the shape the old host path built) gives every thread its own cache line
per load and costs a full-domain transpose twice per step.

SCRATCH ACCOUNTING
------------------
Eighteen ``(nk, ncol)`` float32 companions: twelve carrying values between
kernels (:data:`SCRATCH_SLOTS`) and six of sedimentation workspace
(:data:`SEDW_SLOTS`), which the three sedimentation kernels share because
they run in sequence.  That is 72 bytes per grid cell, allocated once
through ``DomainState.scratch`` and reused for the life of the run.  Six
diagnostics and seven surface fields are additional and are outputs, not
scratch.  Four candidates were deliberately NOT given arrays -- ``inv_dzq``,
``t_old``, ``ze_ice`` and ``ze_rain`` -- because each is exactly
reproducible from a field that is stored, so recomputing them is bit-exact
and 4 * nk * ncol bytes cheaper each.

ARMS
----
``unfused`` is the reference: nine launches, one per step of the authority,
and the arm every agreement number in the receipts was measured on.
``fused`` composes the same device step functions into three launches and
additionally merges the homogeneous-freezing and final-diagnostics k-loops.
Fusing reorders nothing here, but "reorders nothing" is checked by a byte
gate (``tests/test_p3_cuda.py``) rather than asserted, because this program
has already shipped a vectorisation that was wrong in 39 elements out of
37.8 million and only a byte gate caught it.
``levels`` uses four launches with level-parallel preparation, process
rates and final diagnostics. ``sedlevels`` also parallelises sedimentation
substeps and is selected by ``cuda``. The sequential arms remain available
as references; ``tests/test_p3_speed_levels.py`` compares their buffers.

CONTRACTION
-----------
``-fmad=false`` on every arm.  The Fortran reference arm was built with
``-ffp-contract=off``, so a contracted ``a*b+c`` on the device is a
different number.  With contraction off, plain infix operators in the .cu
are the ``__fmul_rn``/``__fadd_rn`` intrinsics; the kernel file carries a
two-kernel probe and the test compiles the module both ways to show the
equality holds under ``false`` and breaks under ``true``.
