"""Per-parent-step nest forcing and experimental two-way restriction.

The coupler is node-facing (``force(node)``), leaves the parent state
read-only, and refreshes child-owned rolling boundary value/tendency tables.
It consumes Task 10's landed full-extent ``bdy_interp1`` unchanged.  F16's
retired perimeter donor strips are replaced by one full-parent coupled field
borrowed from the shared, lifetime-audited arena for each field in turn.

WHEN A COUPLED DOMAIN IS STREAMED, ``node.state`` IS NOT THE DOMAIN
------------------------------------------------------------------
``woof.core.streaming.attach`` copies a prepared domain's carriers into a
store and every sweep after that updates THE STORE.  The ``DomainState``
object stays in the tree and its device arrays stop moving.  Every read in
this module is off ``node.state`` / ``parent.state``, so a coupler that did
not know about the store would:

* force the child from the parent's air AT ATTACH TIME, for the whole
  forecast, with no NaN and no warning -- a nest that looks like it is
  running and is being driven by t=0;
* under ``feedback=1``, write the parent's prognostics into arrays the next
  sweep re-reads from the store, so two-way feedback is silently discarded.

Both are repaired by reading and writing the domain's STORE rather than its
state.  Which door does that depends on how the state is marked; the two
sections below are the two doors.

BOUNDED OPERANDS: EVERY ``StreamedDomain``, PARENT OR CHILD
-----------------------------------------------------------
A ``StreamedDomain`` built on a state marks it (``state._streamed_domain``),
and every streamed domain a route builds is one, so this is the path a
streamed domain takes in a forecast.  When EITHER endpoint of an edge
carries the marker, ``force`` and ``feedback_commit`` take bounded operands
from :class:`woof.core.nest_operands.NestWindowSource`, which reads the
owner's store directly: FORCE assembles the rolling tables from child
boundary chunks and the exact SINT donor rectangles
(``nest_interp.window_registration``, the stencil's own two-cell halo
included), and feedback restricts child chunks straight into the parent
owner through ``NestWindowSource.write``.  A marked parent runs the same
smoother kernels with one explicitly reported host J-pass scratch
rectangle, then re-diagnoses the changed columns in bounded chunks.  None
of this reads the frozen ``DomainState`` or needs a full-parent device
field, which a tiled root whose store is filled from the preparation head
(a :class:`woof.core.streamed_state.CanonicalStoreState`) does not have.
A resident child still diagnoses a mixed-scheme parent species on its own
grid (:meth:`NestCoupler._mapped_child_field`) and restricts windows of
that mapped field; a marked child drops those species at prepare, named
once.

MEASURED on a card: ``tilestream/test_nest.py`` (d01 192x192x49 dx 9 km
streamed from a pinned host store at tile 64, d02 96x96x49 nested 3:1 and
resident, 6 parent steps) and ``tilestream/test_nest_executor.py`` (the
same shape through ``execute_experiment``) hold both domains bit-identical
to the all-resident control at ``feedback=0`` and ``feedback=1``.  Their
negative controls aim at this door: N serves every parent operand from
the frozen attach-time state (d02 must move), W keeps the operands fresh
only inside the halo-free child footprint so the SINT halo reads stale
cells (d02 must move, d01 must not), and the write-back control drops the
parent writes (d01 must move).  ``tilestream/test_streamed_child.py`` and
``tests/test_both_streamed_nesting.py`` hold the streamed-child and
both-streamed shapes.

THE PUBLISHED-STORE SEAM: A STORE WITHOUT AN OWNER MARKER
---------------------------------------------------------
:func:`woof.core.streaming.domain_store` answers ``None`` for every
resident domain, which is every domain in a run that configures no
``[tiles]``.  A state that publishes a store with no ``StreamedDomain``
marker (the CPU stand-ins in ``tests/test_nest_coupler.py`` and
``tests/test_nest_streamed_transition_edge.py``) is coupled through the
older seam: ``_sync_in`` pulls the footprint window
(:func:`parent_footprint_window`) into the state's own arrays before the
whole-field kernels run, and ``_sync_out`` pushes the feedback write-back.
That seam is what ``tilestream/test_nest.py`` first measured: with the
store not consulted d02 differed in 89 of 155 carriers by up to 1.04e+08
while d01 stayed bit-exact.  The gates above disarm it as well as the
bounded operands, so each control fires whichever door the coupler takes.

The bounded operands close operand ownership, not admission: allocator
pool retention, the host smoothing scratch, rolling tables and
simultaneous tiled buffers still need inclusion in the route's capacity
proof. Mixed microphysics and optional inflow hooks retain their separate
contracts. No admission guard is relaxed by this implementation.
