"""Per-parent-step nest forcing and experimental two-way restriction.

The coupler is node-facing (``force(node)``), leaves the parent state
read-only, and refreshes child-owned rolling boundary value/tendency tables.
It consumes Task 10's landed full-extent ``bdy_interp1`` unchanged.  F16's
retired perimeter donor strips are replaced by one full-parent coupled field
borrowed from the shared, lifetime-audited arena for each field in turn.

WHEN A COUPLED DOMAIN IS STREAMED, ``node.state`` IS NOT THE DOMAIN
------------------------------------------------------------------
``woof.core.streaming.attach`` copies a prepared domain's carriers into a
store and every sweep after that updates THE STORE.  The ``DomainState``
object stays in the tree and its device arrays stop moving.  Every read in
this module is off ``node.state`` / ``parent.state``, so a coupler that did
not know about the store would:

* force the child from the parent's air AT ATTACH TIME, for the whole
  forecast, with no NaN and no warning -- a nest that looks like it is
  running and is being driven by t=0;
* under ``feedback=1``, write the parent's prognostics into arrays the next
  sweep re-reads from the store, so two-way feedback is silently discarded.

Both are repaired by asking :func:`woof.core.streaming.domain_store`
whether a state is a window onto something else -- ``None`` for every
resident domain, which is every domain in a run that configures no
``[tiles]`` -- and moving exactly the fields the transaction reads or
writes.

MEASURED, ``tilestream/test_nest.py``: d01 192x192x49 dx 9 km STREAMED from
a pinned host store at tile 64 (3x3, exact) with halo 16 from
``harness.halo_radius``, d02 96x96x49 nested 3:1 and resident,
full(reference case)+KF, 6 parent steps and 18 child steps.  With the store
consulted, both domains are bit-identical to the all-resident control --
0 of 155 carriers differ on each -- at ``feedback=0`` and at ``feedback=1``.
With it not consulted, which is the code path before this paragraph existed,
d01 is still bit-exact (streaming itself was never the problem) and d02
differs in 89 of 155 carriers with a worst absolute difference of 1.04e+08.
The two feedback controls fire too: ``feedback=1`` differs from
``feedback=0`` on the resident control, and disarming ONLY the write-back
leaves the parent's store without the child's mass.

BOUNDED OPERANDS FOR A CANONICAL STREAMED CHILD
---------------------------------------------
An actual ``_streamed_domain`` owner now selects bounded operands from
``nest_operands``. FORCE assembles the same rolling tables from child
boundary chunks and exact SINT donor rectangles. Feedback restricts child
chunks directly into the parent owner. A streamed parent runs the same
smoother kernels with one explicitly reported host J-pass scratch rectangle,
then diagnoses changed columns in bounded chunks. These paths need no
resident child field or full-child F16 scratch. The ordinary resident route
and the older published-store correctness seam remain intact.

This closes operand ownership, not admission: allocator pool retention,
the host smoothing scratch, rolling tables and simultaneous tiled buffers
still need inclusion in the route's capacity proof. Mixed microphysics and
optional inflow hooks retain their separate contracts. No admission guard is
relaxed by this implementation.
