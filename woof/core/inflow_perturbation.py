"""CPM-style inflow turbulence seeding for one-way LES nest children.

A one-way LES child receives smoothed parent fields through its lateral
boundary and has to grow its own turbulence while the inflow advects
across the domain.  The measured cost on the shipped 250 m child is a
spin-up fetch larger than the domain itself
(docs/superpowers/receipts/les/INFLOW-FETCH-D90-2026-08-03.md).  This
module seeds that transition: cell-blocked potential-temperature
perturbations applied to the child's rolling boundary VALUE tables on
the inflow-side relax-zone rows, refreshed on the FORCE cadence, so the
existing Davies relaxation nudges the relax zone toward a perturbed
target and advection carries the blocks into the interior where
buoyancy amplifies them.

Every constant is pinned in
docs/superpowers/receipts/les/INFLOW-GENERATOR-ACCEPTANCE-V2.md,
registered before any perturbed integration existed.  The mechanism in
one paragraph:

* Only the theta VALUE tables are touched, only on width rows
  ``d in [spec_zone, relax_zone)``: the rows whose ``fcx[d]``
  relaxation target the state_specified_relaxation kernel reads.  The
  spec-zone row, all tendency tables, and every other field are
  byte-untouched, so mass, momentum and the outer specified rim remain
  exactly the parent's.
* The increment is applied in the tables' own WRF-coupled units:
  ``delta_table = (c1h[k]*(mub2d + mu_table) + c2h[k]) * delta_theta``,
  the same hybrid mass coupling ``coupled_current`` (lbc_state.cu)
  uses, so ``delta_theta`` Kelvin shift the relaxation equilibrium by
  ``delta_theta`` Kelvin.
* Amplitude follows the pinned Eckert-number convention
  ``theta_max = scale * U^2 / (Ec * cp)`` with Ec = 0.2 and U the
  face-mean boundary-normal wind over the perturbed depth.
* The perturbed depth is the parent-diagnosed PBLH over the child's
  footprint (the parent physics driver's own ``pblh`` field), times a
  pinned fraction of 1.0, expressed in child base-state half-level
  heights.
* Draws are uniform in [-1, 1), one per (mass level, 8-cell along-face
  block), held for 100 s of model time, from a counter-based NumPy
  Philox generator keyed on (seed, grid_id, face, refresh index): the
  same draw on every card, every run, every restart.  The hold is
  quantised on the parent's CONFIGURED step, which is a run constant,
  so an adaptive parent holds each draw for the same 100 s and the
  index never repeats (:meth:`InflowPerturbation._refresh_for`).

OFF is absolute: when ``inflow_perturbation`` is false (the default)
:func:`build_inflow_perturbation` returns ``None`` and the coupler
executes not one instruction of this module, the OFF trajectory is
byte-identical to a build without this file (acceptance gate G1).
With ``inflow_perturbation_amplitude_scale = 0.0`` the hook runs its
read-only classification and skips every table write (gate G2).

This is an ArWen-over-WRF extension, entered in PROVENANCE.md (D10):
stock WRF v4.6.1 ships ``perturb_bdy`` (stochastic-pattern boundary
TENDENCY perturbation in the stoch package) and no cell-perturbation
path; the OFF default keeps every WRF-parity configuration untouched.

        THE OUTFLOW CONTROL CANNOT BE READ WITHOUT THIS.  The shipped
        ``faces = "outflow"`` mutation (acceptance G5) selects the
        complementary faces and takes each one's amplitude from ITS OWN
        wind -- ``theta_max = scale * U^2 / (Ec * cp)`` -- so the two
        arms are not amplitude-matched by construction and a slower
        leaving face injects quadratically less.  A null result from an
        unmatched control is not evidence that seeding the leaving edges
        fails to shorten the fetch; it is evidence that barely anything
        was seeded.  Emitting the injected amplitude, the perturbed face
        length and the perturbed level count per face is what lets a
        reader tell those two apart -- and lets the report say the
        control was unmatched when it was, which is a finding rather
        than a failure.

        ``forces`` counts faces SELECTED, including any at exactly zero
        amplitude, so a receipt distinguishes "never selected" from
        "selected and injected nothing".
