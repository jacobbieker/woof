"""Thompson's own entry moment-consistency block, on the host.

WRF v4.6.1 ``phys/module_mp_thompson.F:1827-1899`` is the first thing the
scheme does to any state handed to it: before a single process rate is
computed, ``mp_thompson`` walks the column and makes every hydrometeor
mass and number pair self-consistent.  Where a species has mass and no
number, the block SETS the number from the mass under the scheme's own
assumed size distribution; where a species has number and no mass, it
zeroes both.  That is the scheme's answer -- not a port's answer -- to
the exact question an analysis increment raises.

It lives in ``woof.core`` rather than beside the other host mirrors in
``woof.verify`` because the mp=28 real-data cold start runs it once over
the analyzed mass (``woof.ingest.real``), and the preparation-only
distribution stages ``real.py`` while omitting the verification package;
``woof.verify.thompson_entry`` re-exports it for the tests that read it
there.

This module is the float32/float64 host mirror of those three arms, and
it exists for two callers, :func:`woof.da.moments.repair_moments` and
the mp=28 cold start in :mod:`woof.ingest.real`; the first
needs the numbers on the host, for a checkpoint or a member's analysis,
with no device and no column driver in reach.  It is the Thompson
counterpart of ``npref._np_morrison_slopes``, which plays the same part
for Morrison.

WHAT THE SCHEME SAYS, ARM BY ARM
--------------------------------
``cloud`` (:1827-1842).  ``nc`` floors at 2 m^-3, which for a cell the
    analysis left empty IS the entry value; ``nu_c`` is then 15, the
    lambda from the mass is far too small, and the ``xDc > 2*D0r`` clamp
    fires, so the rediagnosed droplet number is the scheme's
    largest-droplet limit at a 100 um mean diameter.

``ice`` (:1851-1869).  ``ni`` floors at ``R2``; the ``ni <= R2`` branch
    sets lambda from a 5 um crystal and caps the result at 999e3 m^-3.
    Any ice mass above ~5e-9 kg m^-3 hits that cap, so the repaired ice
    number is 999e3 m^-3 for every cell a radar analysis creates.

``rain`` (:1878-1898).  ``nr`` floors at ``R2``; the ``nr <= R2`` branch
    sets the median volume diameter to 1 mm and back-computes the number
    from it.  The recomputed lambda reproduces that 1 mm, so neither
    size clamp fires afterwards.

DENSITY
-------
Every arm works in per-volume units and the caller's state is per
kilogram, so a density is needed.  It very nearly cancels: at a cell
with ``q > 0`` and ``N <= 0`` the repaired per-kilogram number is
exactly proportional to the mass and INDEPENDENT of density for cloud
and rain, because the size clamp that fires replaces the only lambda the
density reached.  Ice is the one exception, and only through its 999e3
m^-3 cap: there the per-kilogram answer is ``999e3 / rho``.
``tests/test_da_moments.py`` pins both halves of that statement rather
than asserting them.

The density used is ``rho = 1/alt``, the same dry density
``woof.core.microphysics`` hands every scheme (its module docstring,
line 25, and ``launch_kessler``'s call site).  WRF's ``mp_thompson``
forms its own entry density from pressure, temperature and vapour at
:1802 instead, and the two differ by order one percent in moist air.
That difference reaches NOTHING except the ice cap, where it moves the
repaired number by the same order one percent -- on a cell that had no
number at all.  It is recorded here because a limit that is written down
is a limit; a limit that is not is a surprise.

PRECISION
---------
Every intermediate below carries the precision the Fortran DECLARES for
it, not the precision Python would pick: ``rc``/``ri``/``rr`` are REAL
(:1579), ``nc``/``ni``/``nr`` are REAL (:1580), ``mvd_r`` is REAL
(:1589), ``lamc``/``lami``/``ilami``/``lamr`` are DOUBLE (:1597-1598)
and ``xDc``/``xDi`` are REAL (:1599).  The association matters as much as
the width, because Fortran's ``*`` and ``/`` share a precedence and
associate to the left: the ice number divides by ``am_i`` BEFORE its
power (:1857) and the rain number divides by ``am_r`` AFTER its power
(:1885), so the two arms cannot share a helper however alike they read.
``tests/test_thompson_entry_wrf_order.py`` holds the whole block against
a line-by-line transcription of the Fortran, bitwise, and pins the
numbers that transcription produces.  This is not decoration: the
``nu_c`` quotient is REAL, and formed in float64 it reads a different
gamma-table row at an ordinary droplet concentration.

CONSTANTS
---------
Nothing is restated.  The gamma moments come from
:mod:`woof.core.thompson_aerosol_contract`, which derives them at
import from WRF's own ``WGAMMA`` and SHA-256 pins the result, and the
scalars are the values ``woof/core/kernels/thompson_aerosol_common.cuh``
already pins with their WRF line numbers.
``tests/test_da_moments.py`` parses that header and asserts every scalar
below equals the ``#define`` it names, so there is one spelling of each
and a drift in either copy is a test failure rather than a quiet
disagreement between the analysis and the forecast.

POWERS
------
Every power here is the libm call gfortran makes for the Fortran ``**``:
a REAL base to a REAL power is :func:`woof.core.noahmp_libm.powf_array`,
glibc's ``powf`` on every host, and a DOUBLE base is
:func:`woof.core.host_libm.power`, the C library's ``pow``.  NumPy's own
``power`` loop rounds differently on an AVX-512 Linux host (NumPy 2.5,
the product boxes' CPUs): there ``make_RainNumber``'s ``10**(279.15-T)``
moved the seeded rain number of 34,076 of 400,000 cells, and the mp=28
droplet number differed from the line-by-line Fortran in 2,510 of 200,000
states, while the same host with the AVX-512 loops disabled matched it
exactly (A143).
