        ``tilestream.multigpu.MultiGPUDomain.refresh_arrays`` aborts the run
        the moment cumulus first fires -- at cudt=5 min and dt=15 s that is
        step 20, twenty steps after anything could still be called a
        start-up failure.  ``tilestream.driver.make_physics_tile_state``
        works around it by throwing a warm-up step away; the array is
        (nz, ny, nx) zeros and there is nothing to warm up.

        Idempotent, and it re-allocates on a state or shape change exactly as
        the lazy path did, so a driver moved to a new state still gets a
        fresh mean rather than the previous domain's memory.
