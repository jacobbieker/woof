"""MYJ (Mellor-Yamada-Janjic level 2.5) PBL, ``bl_pbl_physics = 2``.

CUDA launcher around :mod:`woof.core.kernels.myjpbl`, the device mirror of
the float32 CPU authority ``woof.verify.myj_ref.np_myjpbl_column``, itself
transcribed from the byte-frozen WRF v4.6.1 ``phys/module_bl_myjpbl.F``.

WHAT THIS SCHEME OWNS.  MYJ predicts TKE (``q**2 = 2*TKE``) with Janjic's
extension of Mellor-Yamada level 2.5, builds the mixing length from it,
forms the exchange coefficients, and then does its OWN implicit vertical
diffusion of heat, moisture, cloud water/ice and momentum -- so the scheme
returns finished TENDENCIES, not diffusivities for someone else to apply.
That is why its surface pairing is not negotiable: the lower boundary of
every one of those solves is ``AKHS``/``AKMS``/``THZ0``/``QZ0``/``UZ0``/
``VZ0``, which only the Eta surface layer produces.

COLUMN LIMIT.  The kernel keeps the whole column in per-thread local
arrays, as YSU's does, so it carries the same compile-time ceiling.  A
deeper column is refused here rather than silently truncated.

Conformance status: implemented-unverified.  ``tests/test_myj_port.py``
asserts CPU-vs-CUDA agreement and physical sanity; NO oracle comparison
against the WRF Fortran has been run.
