"""The RUC soil column's compile-time geometry tier.

``woof/core/kernels/ruc.cu`` sizes every per-thread soil scratch array from
``RUC_NZS`` and selects its level table with the same macro.  This module is
the one place that decides what ``RUC_NZS`` a given soil geometry compiles
with, and it is the RUC analogue of the ``WPHI_MAX_LEV`` ladder that
:mod:`woof.core.acoustic` owns for the implicit w''-phi'' solve.

WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE, and not three functions in
:mod:`woof.core.ruc_gpu` where the launchers that use them live:
``ruc_gpu`` imports CuPy at module scope, so importing it requires a CuPy
install.  The whole value of :func:`ruc_kernel_source` is that the string
NVRTC will receive can be digested, preprocessed and compiled to PTX on a
box with no CuPy and no card -- that is what makes the nine-level
bit-identity claim in ``tests/test_ruc_nzs_tier.py`` a measurement rather
than an assertion.  A tier helper that can only be imported next to a GPU
cannot carry that proof, so the tier lives here, beside the contract, and
``ruc_gpu`` imports it.  :mod:`woof.core.kernels` is CuPy-free to import
for the same reason (its ``import cupy`` calls are inside the loaders).

RUC_MODULE = "ruc"

#: SOILPROP's two WRF lineages, by name (``RunConfig.ruc_soilprop``).
#:
#: ``wrf_45``: WRF v4.0 to v4.5 ``phys/module_sf_ruclsm.F`` SOILPROP
#: (v4.5.2 :6154, :6213-6216, :6245), byte-identical in the operational
#: RAP/HRRR branch (:6343, :6402-6407, :6434).  Soil-water diffusivity and
#: hydraulic conductivity are normalised by the moisture above the residual,
#: ``(theta - qmin) / (theta_sat - qmin)``, and Johansen's mineral
#: conductivity is 2.0 at every quartz fraction.
#:
#: ``wrf_461``: WRF v4.6.1 (:6198-6202, :6261-6267, :6289): total moisture
#: over porosity, and 3.0 below 20 percent quartz.  In dry soil this
#: diffusivity is 2.5 to 8 times the v4.5 value.  MEASURED on a 3 km
#: afternoon cut of a native operational-HRRR start (2026-10-02 21Z, 106,671
#: land cells): the top soil level rose from 0.161 to 0.187 m3/m3 in the first
#: hour, fed from the levels below, where the operational model's own top
#: level fell to 0.157; latent heat flux 207 W/m2 against its 142.  Kept
#: selectable by name for WRF v4.6.1 column parity; it is not the default.
#:
#: Two layers, two defaults, on purpose.  The forecast runtime
#: (``ruc_lsm_step``, the fused step, every loader in this module) defaults
#: to ``wrf_45`` and is always handed ``RunConfig.ruc_soilprop``.  The
#: transcription leaves under it (``woof.core.ruc`` and ``ruc_gpu``:
#: ``soilprop``, ``soil``, ``snowsoil``, ``sfctmp``, ``LSMRUC``) default to
#: ``wrf_461``, the lineage their WRF v4.6.1 oracles were recorded with, so a
#: bare leaf call is still the oracle's arithmetic; the runtime passes the
#: name at every call it makes into them.
RUC_SOILPROP_FORMS = ("wrf_45", "wrf_461")
RUC_SOILPROP_DEFAULT = "wrf_45"

#: LSMRUC's cold start of the ground vapour and condensate (QVG, QCG) when
#: the run starts without them (``RunConfig.ruc_qvg_cold_start``).
#:
#: ``air``: the operational RAP/HRRR branch, ``module_sf_ruclsm.F:479-483``
#: there: an invalid QVG takes the lowest-level vapour and QCG becomes 0; the
#: branch has no separate QCG check.  Its comment gives the reason: QSG times
#: MAVAIL is a bad approximation where MAVAIL is very low.  No public WRF
#: carries it.
#:
#: ``wrf``: public WRF v4.6.1 ``:505-514`` (v4.5.2 ``:481`` alike): an
#: invalid QCG takes the lowest-level condensate, an invalid QVG takes
#: saturation at the skin times moisture availability.
#:
#: Generic forecasts default to ``wrf``. The operational namelist importer
#: and configuration recipe explicitly select ``air``. SOILTEMP's energy
#: balance carries the vapour storage of the constant-flux layer from OLD QVG
#: (``xlv*r210*qvg`` with ``r211 = 0.5*conflx/delt``, ten to thirty times
#: the exchange coefficient at a 12 to 20 s step), so the first steps tie
#: the skin to whatever QVG the start supplied.  The branch's fallback is
#: rarely run there (it cycles QVG); every woof forecast is a cold start.
#: MEASURED, the RUC runtime fixture (moist loam, 12 s step): ``air`` puts
#: the first-step skin at 296.3 K against 302.2 K, sensible heat at -105
#: against +58 W/m2, and after 20 steps the skin is still 2.7 K colder.
#: MEASURED, a 3 km cut of a native operational-HRRR start (106,671 land
#: cells): ``air`` moves the 2 m dewpoint by -0.013 / -0.016 K at f01 / f02
#: of a 21Z start and by +0.018 K of an 06Z start against the operational
#: model's own files.

RUC_QVG_COLD_START_DEFAULT = "wrf"

#: How SFCDIAGS_RUCLSM writes T2, TH2 and Q2 (``RunConfig.ruc_2m_diagnostic``).
#:
#: ``flux``: public WRF ``module_sf_sfcdiags_ruclsm.F:53-146``, the flux form,
#: and the default.
#:
#: ``log_profile``: adds the block the operational RAP/HRRR branch carries at
#: ``:150-179`` there and no public WRF 3.9 to 4.7.1 has.  With dT = T1 - TSK,
#: dQ = qlev1 - QSFCmr and dz1 = half the lowest layer: where dT > 0,
#: fh = min(max(1 - dT/10, 0.01), 1) and fac = log(2.05/(0.05 + fh)) /
#: log((dz1 + 0.05)/(0.05 + fh)), T2 = TSK + fac*(T1 - TSK) and TH2 from it;
#: where dQ > 0, the same with fh from dQ/0.003, Q2 = QSFCmr + fac*(qlev1 -
#: QSFCmr), with no saturation cap.  Elsewhere the flux values stand.
#:
#: MEASURED on a 3 km cut of a native operational-HRRR start (106,671 land
#: cells), against the operational model's own files: on an 06Z start (97
#: percent of land stable) it lowers T2 by 0.33 to 0.36 K, which moves the
#: mean from -0.03 / +0.03 / +0.04 K to -0.39 / -0.32 / -0.29 K at f01 to
#: f03, and moves the 2 m dewpoint by -0.008 to -0.011 K; on a 21Z start it
#: lowers T2 by 0.06 / 0.14 K and leaves Q2 unchanged.  Either the
#: operational files' 2 m values do not come from this block as ported or
#: the port differs from the branch elsewhere. Generic forecasts keep the
#: flux default; the operational namelist importer and configuration recipe
#: explicitly select log_profile to reproduce the fork diagnostic block.

#: The RUC snow scheme's two WRF lineages (``RunConfig.ruc_snow``).

#: operational RAP/HRRR branch carries line for line apart from dead code.
#: Constant snow conductivity 0.265 W/m/K (4.6.1's ``isncond_opt = 1``);
#: snow cover ``min(1, snhei/(2*snhei_crit))`` with the critical depth taken
#: after compaction and new-snow density (4.6.1's ``isncovr_opt = 1``
#: formula, at the branch's position), and not rebuilt after the snow
#: column; fresh-snow albedo kept from the depth on the ground; melt cap
#: independent of the step; melt bookkeeping scaled by cover under the
#: snow mosaic; SNOWFALLAC grown by new snow less its melt; and the
#: ``ktau = 1`` snow cover default from snow water.
#:
#: ``wrf_461``: WRF v4.6.1 (``isncond_opt = 2``, ``isncovr_opt = 2``), the
#: form every earlier woof build ran and the WRF v4.6.1 oracle pins.
#:
#: The generic forecast and transcription leaves default to ``wrf_461``.
#: The operational namelist importer and configuration recipe select
