"""WRF's adaptive time-step controller (``dyn_em/adapt_timestep_em.F``).

Ported against the Fortran, not against a description of it, and graded by
a captured oracle (``tools/calc_dt_wrf_oracle/``) at ``max_ulp == 0``.

TWO KINDS OF ARITHMETIC LIVE HERE, and keeping them apart is the whole
correctness argument.

* The **factor** is REAL(4).  ``calc_dt`` computes it in single precision
  and then quantises it to an integer numerator over ``precision`` (100).
  Every operation below that touches ``factor`` is done in ``np.float32``
  in upstream's exact order, because the quantisation ``INT(x*100 + 0.5)``
  sits right on a tie for values like 1.51 -- whose float32 image is
  1.50999999, so ``INT(150.999999 + 0.5)`` is 151 and not the 152 a
  decimal reading would give.  That is not a rounding curiosity: it is one
  part in 100 of every subsequent timestep.

* The **interval** is exact rational.  ESMF's ``ESMF_BaseTimeQuotI8``
  (external/esmf_time_f90/ESMF_BaseTime.F90:183) is integer arithmetic --
  ``n = S*Sd + Sn; d = Sd*divisor``, then ``simplify`` (gcd) and
  ``normalize_basetime`` -- so ``last_dtInterval * num / den`` carries no
  floating-point error at all.  :class:`fractions.Fraction` reproduces it
  exactly, which is also what ``woof.core.clock`` already uses at
  config-resolution time.  So a varying dt does NOT push WOOF's clock
  into floating point; it only requires ``tick_den`` to carry a factor of
  ``precision``.

Fortran operator precedence matters in ``last_dtInterval * num / den``:
that is ``(last * num) / den``, multiply first.  Both steps are exact, so
the grouping does not change the value -- but it does change which
intermediate could overflow ESMF's INTEGER(8), and the port keeps the
same order for that reason.

Graded against **WRF 4.8.0**, ``dyn_em/adapt_timestep_em.F`` sha256
9d5f1a18ee7b22d676f9747ceeb67a74f71cd4e373b0c926cd015aa3565744f5 -- the
digest rather than a path, so the reference is checkable from any
checkout.  A moving-nest WRF tree differs from a stationary one there by
a local restart patch; ``calc_dt`` itself is identical in both.
