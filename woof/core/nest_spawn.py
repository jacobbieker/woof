"""Nest spawn-at-trigger: a dormant nest's WHEN and WHERE.

:mod:`woof.core.storm_tracking` decides when and where an EXISTING nest
moves.  This module is the same decision for a nest that does not exist
yet: a ``[[domain]]`` declared with a ``spawn`` table is DORMANT -- fully
declared (size, resolution, physics, a placeholder placement), reserved
in the memory plan at startup exactly as if it existed, and integrating
nothing -- until its trigger fires on the RUNNING PARENT'S OWN FIELDS,
at which point it materializes at the trigger-chosen placement and is a
static nest from then on ([relocation.follow] takes over if configured).

RESERVATION, STATED PLAINLY.  A declared-but-never-triggered nest costs
its full reserved VRAM for the whole run and zero compute.  That is the
design, not an accident: the reservation is what makes VRAM
deterministic, lets preflight refuse accurately at planning time, and
makes spawning an ACTIVATION rather than a mid-run allocation that can
OOM after hours of integration.  ``woof check`` says this per dormant
domain (:func:`woof.core.preflight.check_advisories`).

THE SEAM (the spawn-provider contract).  The runner side -- the same
cadence loop that consumes :class:`~woof.core.storm_tracking
.StormTracker` -- consumes a :class:`SpawnController` through one call,
evaluated once per relocation cadence (a cycle boundary, never
mid-step)::

    controller.evaluate(grid_id, parent_state, t,
                        active_footprints=...) -> SpawnEvent | None

``parent_state`` is the dormant domain's PARENT's live state; ``t`` is
model seconds since the experiment start (model time, so the window
arithmetic is deterministic); ``active_footprints`` is where the
parent's LIVE children currently sit, as
:class:`~woof.core.storm_tracking.NestFootprint`-coercible objects --
position state lives with the runner, exactly as it does for the
tracker, so this module never disagrees with the runner about the tree.
A returned :class:`SpawnEvent` names the domain and the chosen
whole-parent-cell placement; the runner materializes it through
:func:`woof.ingest.nest_spawn_init.spawn_child_from_parent` and the
leg/schedule surgery of :func:`woof.experiment.active_experiment`.  A
controller proposes; it never builds anything.

MULTIPLE DORMANT NESTS are first-class: each ``[[domain]]`` carries its
own trigger and its own reservation, and two nests must be able to fire
on two different storms.  Two rules provide that:

- per-nest search boxes (``search_box``, or the declared footprint plus
  the ``[relocation.follow]`` margin, or the whole parent); and
- exclusion: a trigger IGNORES signal inside another ACTIVE nest's
  footprint on the SAME parent grid -- the simplest accurate rule for
  "that storm is taken".  A footprint is cell numbers on one grid, so it
  is only ever applied to watches on that grid
  (:attr:`~woof.core.storm_tracking.NestFootprint.parent_id`).
  :meth:`SpawnController.evaluate_all` additionally feeds each event
  fired at a boundary into the exclusion set of the nests on the same
  parent evaluated after it (grid_id order), so two triggers at one
  boundary cannot claim the same centroid.

CONFIG.  ``spawn = { ... }`` inline table on the dormant ``[[domain]]``:
``trigger`` (``"uh"`` | ``"reflectivity"`` | ``"pressure"`` |
``"time"``).  Field triggers require ``threshold`` (m2 s-2 for uh, dBZ
for reflectivity; see below for pressure), ``earliest_s`` and
``latest_s`` (the model-time window; after ``latest_s`` the watch closes
and the nest never spawns), and admit an optional ``search_box = [i_lo,
j_lo, i_hi, j_hi]`` (1-based inclusive parent cells).  ``trigger =
"time"`` is the manual, deterministic form for testability: it requires
``at_s`` alone and spawns at the DECLARED placement at the first cadence
at or after ``at_s``.  Every key is honored or refused, never ignored,
and the constructed config echoes its values
(:meth:`SpawnConfig.to_json`).

THE INVERTED TRIGGER.  ``trigger = "pressure"`` is the birth side a
tropical cyclone was missing: ``[relocation.follow]`` could ride a
vortex all day, and nothing could decide to OPEN the nest, because both
of the other signals are maxima and a cyclone is a minimum.  It carries
the follow block's own two optional knobs, validated by the same
function (:func:`woof.core.storm_tracking.normalise_pressure_surface`)
so the two tables cannot draw the units differently:

``level_hpa``
    which surface the vortex is looked for ON.  Absent is
    :data:`~woof.core.storm_tracking.DEFAULT_LEVEL_HPA` (850 hPa),
    where ``threshold`` is METRES of geopotential height above the
    search box's own minimum; ``level_hpa = 0`` is the sea-level
    reduction, the one form whose ``threshold`` is an absolute hPa
    ceiling.  The two bands are disjoint, so a config that means one and
    would be read as the other refuses at load rather than spawning on
    the wrong field.  ONE surface: the extremum cell is what claims a
    storm under the exclusion rule above, and a deep-layer mean of
    per-level centres has none.
``radius_km``
    how far from the extremum the centroid may draw (default 50 km).
    Refused under ``uh``/``reflectivity``, whose centroid is already
    bounded by the footprint-sized window around the loudest cell.

Under ``level_hpa`` the threshold is RELATIVE, so some cell always
qualifies; the watch therefore fires only when the search box's own
signal SPAN reaches ``threshold``.  A flat box is a no-signal, not a
spawn at the box's own centre.
