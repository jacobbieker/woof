"""Launcher facade for WRF v4.6.1 Thompson aerosol-aware (``mp_physics=28``).

This module is **re-exports only**.  It contains no arithmetic, no argument
marshalling and no state: every name below is bound directly from the module
that owns it, so ``from woof.core.thompson_aerosol import X`` and
``from woof.core.thompson_aerosol_<owner> import X`` are the same object.

Why it exists
-------------
``woof/core/thompson.py`` is a single module that owns every classic
(``mp_physics=8``) launcher, and ``woof/core/microphysics.py::_apply_thompson``
imports from exactly one place.  mp=28's launchers are spread over six owner
modules because six agents built them in parallel against six separate CUDA
translation units (MP28_PORT_SPEC.md, "Strategy").  Without a facade the
forecast adapter would have to name all six, and the *set* of modules would
become an implicit part of the adapter's contract -- so moving one launcher
between owners would edit the adapter, which is exactly the coupling the
per-file ownership rule exists to prevent.

What it deliberately does NOT do
--------------------------------
* It does not re-export anything from :mod:`woof.core.thompson`.  The mp=28
  adapter calls four classic launchers (graupel-number init/finalize, the two
  column-mask helpers) and four classic sedimentation launchers **by their own
  names, from their own module**, so a reader of the adapter can see at a
  glance which lines are frozen mp=8 code being reused unchanged.  Aliasing
  them through here would hide that.
* It does not re-export the ``probe_*`` diagnostics.  Those are test
  instruments; a forecast path that can reach one is a forecast path that can
  accidentally depend on one.
* Importing it compiles nothing, uploads nothing, and does not make
  ``mp_physics=28`` selectable.

The tuples at the bottom are the published inventory.  ``AEROSOL_LAUNCHERS``
is what ``tests/test_thompson_aerosol_adapter.py`` uses to install call
recorders, so a launcher that is not listed here cannot be pinned by the
call-order gate.
