"""Forecast adapter for the exact port of WRF v4.6.1's bundled RRTMG.

``RRTMGLegacyRadiation`` serves ``RunConfig.ra_rrtmg_variant =
"rrtmg_legacy"`` on the resolved 4/4 radiation pair.  It is pure wiring:
every FP statement it performs is either (a) one of the bitwise-gated
building blocks (``rrtmg_legacy_prep`` batch twins, the device McICA
twin, the batched LW/SW CUDA engines, the WRF-level output mappings,
``woof.ingest.wrf_ozone``), (b) the documented driver-side seams that
have no bitwise oracle (``radconst``/``calc_coszen`` FP32 transcription,
phy_prep's ``t8w`` construction, ``cal_cldfra1`` imported from
``woof.core.rrtmgp``), or (c) the WRF radiation driver's own two output
lines (grid-wide GSW/RTHRATENSW zeroing and ``SWDOWN = GSW/(1-ALBEDO)``,
``module_radiation_driver.F:1721,1738,2877``).  The design authority is
``docs/rrtmg_legacy_integration.md``; the booby-trap boundary (section
10) is what tests/test_rrtmg_legacy_wiring.py proves: a legacy-selected
call must run the device McICA twin and the batched CUDA engines, never
the NumPy compute chain.

The implemented option envelope (dossier section 1) is pinned here and
fails closed on anything else: ``icloud=1``, ``cldovrlp=2`` (McICA
maximum-random), ``idcor=0``, ``o3input in {0, 2}``, ``ghg_input=0``,
``aer_opt=0``, ``swint_opt=0``.  ``o3input=0`` selects the wrapper's
O3DATA branch; ``o3input=2`` selects CAM climatology.

Night contract (dossier section 3): the driver-level zeroing is realized
by allocating RTHRATENSW/GSW as zeros and writing only day columns; the
wrapper-level night write (COSZR + the SW_NIGHT_ZEROED list) still runs
through ``swrad_night_outputs_batch`` so the wrapper contract stays
exercised even though none of those diagnostics reach
:class:`RadiationResult`.  WRF zeroes the SWUPT.. optional-diagnostic
bundle only IF PRESENT (module_ra_rrtmg_sw.F:11568-11589); woof's
contract is that the full bundle is ALWAYS materialized (the night
helper returns every member unconditionally).

Radii seam (dossier sections 9.3, 11): woof state ``effc/effi/effs``
carry MICRONS; the wrapper takes meters, so the adapter multiplies by
``F(1e-6)`` exactly once at this boundary.  Meter-scale state (a restart
written before the Thompson radii-units fix) is rejected with a
migration pointer, never silently rescaled.

Ozone routing: WRF v4.7.1's EM_CORE guards BOTH halves of the
``o3input = 2`` chain on ``id == 1`` -- ``oznini`` interpolates the
packaged climatology to a domain's own XLAT under
``o3input .EQ. 2 .AND. id .EQ. 1`` (module_physics_init.F:2203-2212), and
``ozn_time_int``/``ozn_p_int`` run under the same guard
(module_radiation_driver.F:1801-1823).  A NEST evaluates neither; it
receives the root's field through the parent-to-child forcing stream the
Registry declares on the variable itself (``rdf=(p2c)``,
Registry/Registry.EM_COMMON:1264).  The decision is "is this domain a
nest?", not "is this grid fine?".

The adapter mirrors that structure and takes its word for what it did
from :mod:`woof.core.cam_ozone`:

* A ROOT adapter (``ozone_parent=None``) runs the bit-ported
  ``woof.ingest.wrf_ozone`` chain on its own grid and RETAINS the
  resulting field: ``ozone_routing = 'root-climatology'``.
* A resident NEST takes an ``ozone_parent=`` provider
  (:class:`ParentOzoneProvider`, wired by ``runtime.prepare_child_case``)
  and obtains the parent's most recent retained field horizontally
  interpolated onto the child grid through woof's certified SINT
  mass-point operator (``woof.core.nest_interp.sint``); it never invokes
  the climatology chain.  ``ozone_routing = 'parent-interpolated'``.  The
  horizontal-interpolation ARITHMETIC is woof's own SINT
  transliteration, the same documented seam class as every other
  nest-interpolation arithmetic difference; the routing (root-compute +
  parent->child interpolation, the child's field updating when the
  parent's does) matches WRF.
* An OFFLINE child (``woof.offline_child_run``, the ndown-equivalent
  route) has no resident parent to interpolate from and is configured as
  a WRF root: ``specified = true``, ``nested = false``, ``parent_id = 0``,
  lateral boundaries read from a file.  WRF's own answer for such a
  domain is the climatology on its own grid, so the route builds a root
  adapter and declares ``ozone_routing = 'child-grid-climatology'`` -- the
  same arithmetic, named so a report says the ozone came from the
  climatology on the child grid and not from the parent.

SW aerosol: the batched CUDA SW engine builds WRF's neutral aer_opt=0
optics (tauaer 0 / ssaaer 1 / asmaer 0, module_ra_rrtmg_sw.F:11333-11460)
internally and REJECTS any other ``aer_opt`` (SW-audit item 1); the
adapter pins ``aer_opt=0`` and passes no aerosol arrays because the
batched entry deliberately has no such parameters.

Sequencing/VRAM shape: the LW and SW pipelines run SEQUENTIALLY per
adapter chunk -- each chunk's prep outputs, device McICA slabs, and
engine transients are dropped before the next stage allocates -- so the
transient device peak is the MAX over the four phases (LW generate, LW
engine, SW generate, SW engine) plus the McICA slabs held as engine
inputs, never the LW+SW sum.  :func:`legacy_radiation_vram_bytes` prices
exactly that shape.
