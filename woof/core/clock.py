"""Integer-tick clock hierarchy and flat schedule executor (Phase 5, L2).

Implements section C of the RATIFIED Phase-5 nesting architecture
(docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-phase5-nesting-architecture.md, 2026-07-16
controller amendment): ``fractions.Fraction`` at CONFIG-RESOLUTION time
only, integer TICKS at runtime.

WRF ORACLE (verified against the bundled v4.6.1 source): the ARW clock is
exact integer-rational -- namelist ``time_step`` plus
``time_step_fract_num/den`` (Registry.EM_COMMON:2245-2246) resolve to the
root REAL dt (share/set_timekeeping.F:343) and the rational stepTime
interval (``WRFU_TimeIntervalSet(stepTime, S=, Sn=, Sd=)``,
share/set_timekeeping.F:359); a child's stepTime is the parent's rational
interval divided by ``parent_time_step_ratio`` EXACTLY, while the REAL
fed to dynamics/physics is the chained single-precision division
``grid%dt = parent%dt / ratio`` (share/set_timekeeping.F:366-368).
:func:`resolve_clock` takes each domain's exact rational dt from
:meth:`woof.experiment.ExperimentConfig.dt_exact`, derives ``tick_den`` =
LCM of the dt denominators, and runs everything after load on integer
ticks.  Bundle chain (1,4,3,3): tick = 1/3 s, step_ticks = 180/45/15/5,
12 h = 129,600 ticks -- 36 d04 steps of 5 ticks == 180 ticks == one d01
step, exactly, forever.

KERNEL dt: T1's chained-FP32 value is CONSUMED from the merged schema --
``DomainConfig.run.dt`` carries the binary64 image of WRF's REAL
``grid%dt`` (the chained division lives in woof/experiment.py, never
here).  :func:`resolve_clock` verifies the FP32 round trip
(``np.float32(run.dt)`` bit-identical) and validates it BIT-EXACTLY
against WRF's REAL construction -- root ``REAL(time_step) +
REAL(fract_num)/REAL(fract_den)`` (set_timekeeping.F:343), child
``parent%dt / ratio`` chained from the consumed parent value (:368); a
value one ULP off is a hard error.  The recomputation is validation
only; ``run.dt`` remains the stored authority.

FP32/FP64 POLICY (section C): seconds are NEVER accumulated in floating
point; :attr:`DomainClock.elapsed_seconds` is refreshed from ticks (one
FP64 division, no drift) and is the internal (interval-selection /
restart) authority.  The KERNEL-FACING running seconds mirror WRF's REAL
``curr_secs`` expression bit-for-bit
(:attr:`DomainClock.elapsed_seconds_fp32`): WRF derives it per step from
the rational clock interval as ``dt_whole + dt_num / REAL(dt_den)``
(dyn_em/adapt_timestep_em.F ``real_time``; built at dyn_em/
solve_em.F:330-333, consumed by first-RK physics :800-815, widened to
REAL*8 only afterwards :4752-4755) -- one ULP from the
FP64-then-cast value at times like d04's 5/3 s (0x3FD55556 vs
0x3FD55555).  :class:`DomainClock` mirrors WRF's REAL boundary-clock
state machine directly: ``dtbc_fp32`` resets to positive FP32 zero at
every nested force (share/mediation_force_domain.F:203-206) and, on the
root, at every external LBC interval seam (``IF (currentTime .EQ.
grid%this_bdy_time) grid%dtbc = 0.``, share/mediation_integrate.F:1522),
then recurs as ``fl32(dtbc_fp32 + dt_fp32)`` immediately before each
solve, matching dyn_em/solve_em.F:371-372 before the boundary consumers
at :932-952.  Because every nested window and root LBC interval starts
from a reset, this recurrence has no cross-interval drift and is
WRF-identical for every ratio chain (PROVENANCE D4).  Exact integer
ticks remain the only sync, alarm, elapsed-time, and restart authority.

AUDIT SCOPE: tests/test_clock.py audits this module's AST (and
woof/core/model.py once it lands): augmented assignments may target
only the integer tick/op counters and their value expressions may
contain no call and no float constant; setattr/getattr/eval/exec and
ufunc ``out=`` mutation are banned outright; the hot-path functions
contain no division, no float constant, and no numpy reference.  The sole
stored-float exception is the source-pinned FP32 dtbc reset/recurrence.
This is an AST-level tripwire, not a type-system proof.  The LEGACY
single-domain accumulators ``state.elapsed_seconds += cfg.dt``
(woof/core/dycore.py:1332/:1438) are outside this executor path and
tracked for T14 replacement (pinned by the audit test).

PHYSICS CALENDARS (section C): WRF computes STEPRA = nint(radt*60/dt),
min 1, per domain (phys/module_physics_init.F); the generalized
``woof.core.physics._physics_interval_steps`` divides exactly when
handed the rational dt, and for fixed clocks :func:`resolve_clock` asserts
the exact and
WRF-REAL (nint on the chained-FP32 dt) paths agree.  Bundle: STEPRA =
12/12/12/36 for d01..d04; KF cudt = 5 d01 steps (900 ticks), d01 only;
bldt = 0 -> every step on each domain's own clock.  history/restart are
tick calendars validated as exact multiples of the owning domain's
step_ticks on fixed clocks. Adaptive history and physics calendars are
exact tick deadlines; the root shortens its step to each deadline in the
tree. Restart alarms evaluate on the d01 clock ONLY (section B).

SCHEDULE (section C): :func:`build_schedule` expands WRF's integration
recursion into a periodic flat per-d01-step op table; the EXECUTOR
(:func:`execute_schedule`) walks precomputed ops with integer comparisons
only -- no Fraction and no float arithmetic on the hot path (the
host-overhead mitigation).  The recursion transcribed, verified verbatim
from the bundled frame/module_integrate.F::

TERMINAL FEEDBACK: RELOCATED, NOT SUPPRESSED (F8 as corrected by the
p5t9 review round -- the ratified F8 wording shares the omission and is
being amended by the controller).  The per-kid guard (:439-445) skips
the LOOP feedback whenever the head grid, the parent, or the child is at
stop time; but WRF RE-ISSUES the feedback at the last-io tail
(:521-525): on every nested ``integrate()`` return, if the head grid or
any grid on the chain from the returning grid up to the head is at stop
time, ``med_nest_feedback(parent, grid)`` runs (:523) immediately before
that grid's last-io check (:524).  The guard exists precisely to avoid
DOUBLING these tail calls (comment at :507).  In the final d01 period
the head is at stop time from its own clockadvance onward, so every
child window of that period emits a TAIL feedback instead of a loop
feedback: for the bundle, 12x d04->d03, 4x d03->d02, 1x d02->d01 -- 17
per period in BOTH interior and final periods.  For a LINEAR chain the
tail op lands at the same flat-table position as the loop op, so the
final period's op sequence EQUALS the interior period's; for a
multi-child tree the positions differ (kid1's tail feedback precedes
kid2's window; the interior loop feedbacks all follow the last window).
Bundle: 53 STEPs + 17 FORCEs + 17 FEEDBACKs per period, 720 identical
periods.  Both this generator and the independent reference recursion in
tests/test_clock.py represent the guard AND the tail (pinned for an
interior AND the final period, on chains (1,4,3,3), (1,3,3), (1,5,3),
(1,4,4,2), and a branching tree where the orders differ).

DORMANT FEEDBACK OPS (Phase-5b activation contract): FEEDBACK ops --
both the loop family (:443) and the terminal tail family (:523) -- are
PRESENT in the table at the exact WRF call positions and INERT this
phase.  As in WRF, the caller dispatches the hook at every op and the
``feedback .NE. 0`` test lives INSIDE the mediation layer
(share/mediation_integrate.F:1035) -- here the handler's
``feedback_prepare``/``feedback_commit``/``feedback_finalize`` transaction
no-ops at feedback = 0, and the experiment loader rejects feedback != 0
until Phase 5b.  Activation flips the loader gate and fills the transaction
with the copy_fcn transliteration
(BOTH parity branches, share/interp_fcn.F:1463-1477 odd / :1565-1654
even); the schedule table -- including the final period's 17 tail
feedbacks -- is already complete for two-way coupling, so activation
changes the handler, never the table.  ``skip_feedback_path`` is the F13
CLOSING run-B switch: bypass the FEEDBACK call path entirely and
whole-output bytes must match run A's no-op execution.

HISTORY/RESTART POSITION: history alarms fire at the top of the step
before solve (the med_before_solve_io position, frame/
module_integrate.F:375), including the t = 0 frame; the run-stop frame is
the med_last_solve_io analogue fired after the walk.  For the bundle
cadence all four domain alarms coincide at 15-min sync ticks, so frames
are time-consistent.  Restart alarms fire at d01 top-of-step boundaries
plus the run-stop boundary, never at t = 0.  The root's external-LBC
dtbc reset fires at interval seams inside the same top-of-step position
(med_latbound_in at the tail of med_before_solve_io,
share/mediation_integrate.F:1522).

    Every comparison is integer arithmetic on precomputed tick calendars
    -- no Fraction, no float division, no float accumulation (AST-audited
    by tests/test_clock.py).  Handlers receive the acting grid_id and its
    live :class:`DomainClock` (plus the parent clock for FORCE/FEEDBACK):

    - ``on_history(grid_id, ticks)`` fires before the next solve at that
      instant (med_before_solve_io position, module_integrate.F:375),
      including t = 0.  Alarms reached at a complete d01 synchronization
      boundary fire tree-wide after the child recursion/feedback block has
      returned.  This is the true period boundary: every due history product
      is consumed before a same-instant restart can publish.
    - ``on_restart(ticks)`` fires on the d01 clock only, after all domains
      have reached the interval boundary and all same-instant history
      handlers have completed, never at t = 0.
    - ``on_lbc_reset(ticks)`` fires on the root at external-boundary
      interval seams (including t = 0, the first interval read) in the
      same top-of-step position (med_latbound_in at the tail of
      med_before_solve_io); the executor resets the root's dtbc clock
      there (``grid%dtbc = 0.``, share/mediation_integrate.F:1522), so
      the first post-seam launch sees one root step of dtbc.
    - ``on_step(grid_id, clock)`` is the solve; the clock advances after
      it (solve_interface :393 then domain_clockadvance :396).  NEST
      boundary kernels launched from inside the solve take
      ``clock.dtbc_launch_fp32`` -- the post-increment value WRF's
      solve_em applies at :371-372 before consuming it at :932-952 --
      and WRF-compatible running seconds from
      ``clock.elapsed_seconds_fp32``.  Davies clock bind (2026-07-28,
      retires the F20 adjudication): the ROOT's external Davies
      launches consume ``dtbc_launch_fp32`` too -- the tree build binds
      the root boundary clock to the external mirror
      (``bind_lateral_boundary_clock``), so the ``on_lbc_reset`` seam
      reset above plus ``prepare_step()`` reproduce WRF's exact
      reset/post-increment recurrence for root relaxation, held moist
      targets, and the final specified-ring overwrite (old record at
      ``dtbc = T_bdy`` on the pre-seam step).  The retired elapsed-based
      consumption survives only on unbound legacy direct paths; the
      pre-bind Phase-4 anchor bytes encode it, and the N-series ratchets
      regenerate against the seam-closure anchor epoch (PROVENANCE.md
      "Root external-boundary dtbc").
    - ``on_force(child_id, parent_id, child_clock, parent_clock)``: the
      parent is exactly one parent-step ahead (asserted tick-exact); the
      child's dtbc resets to 0 afterwards (mediation_force_domain.F:
      203-206).
    - ``on_feedback_prepare(...)``, ``on_feedback_commit(...)``, then
      ``on_feedback_finalize(...)`` form one DORMANT transaction at each
      exact WRF feedback position -- the per-kid loop family (:443,
      interior periods) and the last-io tail family (:523, final period).
      Missing handlers are no-ops at feedback = 0.  Phase 5b activates
      the three handlers, not the table; ``feedback_calls`` counts
      transactions, not individual phases.  ``skip_feedback_path=True``
      is the F13 CLOSING run-B bypass.
