"""Named step-local device workspace for the MYNN PBL solver.

Every device array the MYNN column solver needs between its own kernels is
declared here, once, as a named slot with an exact shape formula in
``(ncol, nz)``.  Nothing in :mod:`woof.core.mynn_pbl_gpu` allocates: it
draws views from a holder built here, and on the runtime path that holder
is backed by :meth:`woof.core.state.DomainState.scratch`, which is the
mechanism ``preflight.scratch_slot_registry`` prices and the shared arena
shares between domains.

Why this module exists at all
-----------------------------
The solver used to allocate its whole working set on every call.  Measured
on the RTX 5090 at ``nz = 49`` by counting every request that reached the
CuPy device allocator during one carried ``mynn_pbl_step``:

  ==========  =========================  ==========  ================
  columns     bytes allocated per step   per column  pool allocations
  ==========  =========================  ==========  ================
  25,600      1,332.9 MiB                54,595      484
  102,400     5,331.6 MiB                54,595      484
  360,000     18,743.8 MiB               54,595      484
  ==========  =========================  ==========  ================

360,000 is the d04 nest of the reference case's 4-domain config.  None of those arrays
appeared in ``physics_array_shapes`` or in the scratch registry, so the
preflight's estimate for a MYNN nest was not merely low, it was blind: what
it could not see outweighed what it could.  On a card with no ECC that is
worse than having no preflight, because the headroom check returns a
reassuring number.

The same measurement through this module reports **54.1 bytes per column**,
18.6 MiB per step at the d04 width -- a factor of 1,008 -- and every byte of
what remains resident is a named slot the registry prices.

Two properties of the declaration matter and are enforced by tests:

* **Bounded.** Slot shapes are written against a *column chunk*, not
  against ``ny * nx``, and ``mynn_pbl_runtime`` walks the domain in chunks
  of that width.  :data:`MYNN_PBL_COLUMN_CHUNK` is a ceiling, so a 600x600
  nest and a 501x501 nest declare byte-for-byte the same workspace and a
  domain narrower than the chunk declares less, never more.  A workspace
  that grew with the domain would price accurately and still not fit.
* **Write-before-read, or constant.** Every slot is either overwritten by
  the kernel that owns it before anything reads it, or it is one of the
  explicitly listed constant-zero feeds WRF passes to a system this lane
  has switched off.  :meth:`MynnPblScratch.poison` fills the first group
  with NaNs, and ``tests/test_mynn_pbl_scratch.py`` uses it to show that a
  misclassified slot changes the forecast.  The constant-zero group is
  never poisoned and never arena-aliased, following the
  ``physics_dry_qv``/``physics_dry_qc`` precedent in the lifetime audit.

#: "workspace MiB" is every live slot including the six full-width returned

#: The plateau is 8k-25k wide.  Below it the walk is kernel-launch bound --
#: at 2,048 columns it is 176 launches of a kernel doing 2,048 columns of

#: the chunk-bounded part of the workspace under 800 MiB at nz = 49.
#: 16,384 is the FLOOR of :func:`derive_mynn_column_chunk`, which is a
#: receipt term rather than the shipped width, so this constant is the lower
#: bound of the receipt's ``would_have_derived`` and nothing else.  It is NOT
#: what a run walks: :data:`MYNN_PBL_COLUMN_CHUNK_DEFAULT` is 8,192 columns,

#: Wider is faster all the way to one chunk per domain.  49,152 and 65,536
#: columns measured 15.52 and 15.82 ms because they leave a short last
#: chunk; walked as equal chunks (the runtime does) they are the 41,472
#: arm.  Threads per block 64 against 128 moved no arm by more than 4 per
#: cent.  In a real 1 h forecast of the same grid (Thompson, MYNN, RUC,
#: legacy RRTMG) the median step went from 132.1 ms on the old kernels to
#: 93.3 ms at 8,192 columns and 71.4 ms at 82,944, every history file's
#: data bitwise identical.
#:
#: The cap is 98,304 columns (5,901 MiB at nz = 59): one chunk for every
#: domain up to 313 x 313, taken only where 1/16 of the card holds it
#: (:data:`MYNN_PBL_RUN_WIDTH_TOTAL_VRAM_FRACTION`), so a 96 GB card runs

#:
#: HISTORY: the 2026-09-15 sweeps on the old layout, which shipped 8,192.
#:
#: Swept through the real forecast door on an RTX 5090 at nz = 59 on
#: 2026-09-15 -- 200 root steps of the 299x299x59 + 282x129 pair's prepared
#: control leg per arm, two passes, the second in reverse order, sole
#: tenant.  Record: ``tools/mynn_chunk_sweep/summary.txt`` and
#: ``sweep.tsv`` beside it, written by the harness in
#: ``tools/mynn_chunk_sweep``.  Nine widths in two sweeps five hours apart,
#: one upward from the width 2.7.4 shipped and one downward from it; they
#: overlap at 16,384 and agree there to 0.0005 s, which is what lets the
#: nine arms be read as one curve.
#:
#: Upward, the sweep that refuted deriving the width from the card:
#:
#:   ==========  =========================  ==============
#:   columns     quiet root cycle, seconds  workspace MiB
#:   ==========  =========================  ==============
#:   16,384                         0.5263            984
#:   32,768                         0.5819          1,967
#:   45,056                         0.6170          2,705
#:   65,536                         0.6252          3,935
#:   90,112                         0.6395          5,410
#:   ==========  =========================  ==============
#:
#: Monotonic, with no knee anywhere in the range and a pass-to-pass spread
#: never worse than 0.0017 s.  All ten arms wrote the same 18 frames
#: (``faa0944f25f12f39d0002db6129c98ace47917bba153e01c849b9c5bffcbfb7c``),
#: so the width remains workspace shape and nothing else.
#:
#: What that refutes: the derivation's card ceiling on the same card is
#: 65,280 columns -- the width its register file admits in one wave -- and
#: it is 18.8 per cent SLOWER per quiet root cycle than 16,384 while
#: costing 2.9 GiB more scratch.  Wider is slower and bigger everywhere in
#: that range, so neither term of ``max(floor, min(card, VRAM))`` predicts
#: throughput here.  The derivation is kept whole, as the receipt's
#: ``would_have_derived``, so the next card's sweep has something to argue
#: with rather than a number nobody can reconstruct.
#:
#: But that sweep bounds the optimum from ONE side.  It started at the
#: width 2.7.4 shipped and only ever widened, so "narrower is faster" was
#: the whole of what it could find and it ranked its own narrowest arm
#: first.  Downward, same card, same prepared leg, same protocol:
#:
#:   ==========  =========================  ==============
#:   columns     quiet root cycle, seconds  workspace MiB
#:   ==========  =========================  ==============
#:    4,096                         0.5039            246
#:    8,192                         0.4450            492
#:   12,288                         0.4819            738
#:   16,384                         0.5268            984
#:   24,576                         0.5353          1,475
#:   ==========  =========================  ==============
#:
#: 8,192 columns is the optimum and it is INTERIOR: 15.5 per cent cheaper
#: per quiet root cycle than 16,384 on half the workspace, leading the
#: runner-up by 0.0369 s against a worst pass-to-pass spread of 0.0037 s
#: anywhere in the sweep, and with the cost turning back up by 13.2 per
#: cent at 4,096, where the launch count starts to dominate.  A minimum
#: with a slower arm on each side is a measurement; a winner at the end of
#: a ladder is only a direction.  All twenty arms across the two sweeps
#: wrote one digest.
#:
#: Confirmed on the full pair and not on the sweep alone: both 1,500-step
#: legs at 8,192 columns, with the rest of this release's installed-engine
#: work applied, took 2,390.5 s against the 16,384-column baseline's
#: 2,877.5 s -- 487.0 s and 16.9 per cent, with all 244 frames
#: byte-identical.  Per leg, 1,339.0 s to 1,064.4 s and 1,368.2 s to
#: 1,152.3 s.  37.8 s of that total is the baseline leg's cold kernel
#: compile rather than a lever, so the steady-state stepping payoff is
#: 451.7 s, of which the chunk width alone is roughly 242 s priced off the
#: sweep's own arms (164.5 s against 148.3 s per 200 cycles); the rest is
#: this release's land-surface and shortwave work.
#:
#: :data:`MYNN_PBL_COLUMN_CHUNK_FLOOR` stays at 16,384: it bounds the
#: derivation that rides the receipt.  The narrowest width a run walks is
#: :data:`MYNN_PBL_COLUMN_CHUNK_MINIMUM`, the old shipped width.
MYNN_PBL_COLUMN_CHUNK_DEFAULT = 98304

#: The narrowest width the memory bound may give: the width that shipped
#: before the level-major layout, so a card with little room runs what it
#: ran before and never less.
#:
#: It is also the width a STREAMED TILE BUFFER walks
#: (:func:`resolve_mynn_tile_column_chunk`).  Every buffer holds its own
#: workspace, so ``nbuffers`` buffers at the run's width hold ``nbuffers``
#: times what the resident domain holds.  MEASURED at 51693ec76 on the
#: 572x524x49 icon-eu MYNN forecast of tests/test_streamed_pricing_window.py
#: (two 286x286 buffers, no card, so the 98,304-column cap): 4.96 GiB of
#: scratch per buffer, a streamed envelope of 22.80 GiB against 20.14 GiB
#: resident; at this width 14.54 against 15.09.  Streaming exists to shrink
#: the device footprint, so its buffers keep the width they walked in 2.8.0.
MYNN_PBL_COLUMN_CHUNK_MINIMUM = 8192

#: The width this process will actually use, published once by
#: :func:`resolve_mynn_column_chunk` and read by anything that reports the
#: knob (``tilestream.shared_workspace.mynn_column_chunk``).  It starts at
#: the cap, which is what a process that never reaches a card uses as well.
MYNN_PBL_COLUMN_CHUNK = MYNN_PBL_COLUMN_CHUNK_DEFAULT

#: Threads per block every MYNN column kernel launches with
#: (``woof.core.mynn_pbl_gpu._TPB``).  The derived ceiling is expressed in
#: whole blocks of this width, so the last block of a full chunk is full.
MYNN_PBL_COLUMN_TPB = 128

#: Registers per thread nvcc gives ``mynn_dmp_mf_columns``, the kernel that
#: sets the occupancy of the whole family (the other three column kernels
#: are far cheaper and ride the same chunk).  READ BACK from the compiled
#: kernel into the receipt by :func:`observe_dmp_registers_per_thread`, so a
#: compiler or an architecture that allocates differently shows up as a
#: number beside this one rather than as a silent mis-derivation.  It only
#: sets a ceiling: too high leaves throughput unclaimed, too low costs a
#: second wave.  Neither is a correctness question -- every width writes the
#: same bits.
#:
#: It is architecture-dependent and the two numbers seen so far are not the
#: same: 168 from the launch geometry in the 170-SM card's profile, and 128
#: from a compile of the same source for sm_86.  That is exactly why the
#: receipt carries the observed count beside this one -- a card whose kernel
#: is cheaper in registers is being given a narrower chunk than its register
#: file would hold, and the receipt is where that shows.
MYNN_DMP_REGISTERS_PER_THREAD = 168

#: Operator override, honoured verbatim and named in the receipt.  This is
#: the handle the chunk sweep drives; it is not a tuning default.
MYNN_PBL_COLUMN_CHUNK_ENV = "WOOF_MYNN_COLUMN_CHUNK"

#: The workspace may occupy this share of the card and this share of what
#: is free on it, whichever is smaller.
#:
#: TOTAL is the term that normally binds, and that is deliberate: it is a
#: property of the card, so two runs of the same case on the same card
#: derive the same width whether or not somebody else's job is resident.
#: FREE is the clamp that holds the derivation to what is actually there
#: when the card really is occupied -- it is read at resolution time,
#: before the domain states allocate, which is why it is halved rather
#: than spent.
MYNN_PBL_CHUNK_TOTAL_VRAM_FRACTION = 0.125
MYNN_PBL_CHUNK_FREE_VRAM_FRACTION = 0.5

#: The share of the card the width a run WALKS may take (the receipt's
#: derivation above keeps its own 1/8).  Half the derivation's share,
#: because this width is priced into every forecast's memory check: on a
#: 24 GB card 1/16 is 1.5 GiB of workspace, 1.0 GiB more than the 8,192
#: columns that shipped before, which a run that fitted with a few GiB to
#: spare still fits; a larger share would move near-capacity runs onto
#: tiles.  The free-memory clamp is the derivation's.
MYNN_PBL_RUN_WIDTH_TOTAL_VRAM_FRACTION = 0.0625

#: The VRAM-derived ceiling is rounded down to a multiple of this many
#: columns (246 MiB of workspace at nz = 59).  Without it a few hundred MiB
#: of drift in what another process holds would move the derived width, and
#: with it the arena size and the memory ledger, between two runs that are
