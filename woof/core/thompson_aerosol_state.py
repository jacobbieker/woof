"""Aerosol state launchers for WRF v4.6.1 Thompson ``mp_physics=28``.

This module owns the **accumulator contract** for the aerosol-aware port:
the entry snapshot, the working-value refresh helpers every other aerosol
package calls, the single terminal apply/clamp, the surface emission,
``thompson_init``'s synthetic CCN/IN profile fill, and the effective-radius
diagnostic.

Numerical authority is ``wrf461-pristine/phys/module_mp_thompson.F``
(WRF v4.6.1, commit ``d66e442``).  Bare line numbers below refer to that file.
Nothing here imports from :mod:`woof.core.thompson`, which is read-only for
this port, and nothing here compiles or touches ``thompson.cu``.

The accumulator contract, restated
----------------------------------
``state.nc`` / ``state.nwfa`` / ``state.nifa`` are **read-only entry state for
the whole call**.  Three device scratch accumulators ``ncten`` / ``nwfaten`` /
``nifaten`` (per kilogram per second, matching WRF's ``orho``-scaled increment
sites at :2964, :2975, :3008, :3833) are zeroed at adapter entry by
:func:`zero_aerosol_accumulators`, written by every aerosol kernel, and applied
**exactly once** by :func:`launch_aerosol_state_finalize`, which carries WRF's
only set of clamps (:3972-4021).

Any kernel that needs a working per-m3 value recomputes it locally the way WRF
does -- :func:`launch_aerosol_working_number` for the aerosol,
:func:`launch_aerosol_working_cloud` for the droplets -- instead of applying
its own delta to state.  WRF clamps once; clamping four times is a silent
physics change.

.. _wp04-height-field:

The height field for the profile fill  (blocking unknown #4, RESOLVED)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The spec's WP-04 text says "hgt is the MASS-level height (WRF passes z_at_q),
so use WOOF's mass-level height array, not z8w."  **That reading is wrong,
and the correction matters over terrain.**  Traced end to end:

* ``phys/module_physics_init.F:4517-4544`` calls ``thompson_init(HGT=z_at_q, ...)``.
* ``dyn_em/start_em.F:870-876`` is the only assignment to ``z_at_q``::

      DO k = kts,kte
         z_at_q(i,k,j) = (grid%ph_2(i,k,j)+grid%phb(i,k,j))/g

* ``Registry/Registry.EM_COMMON:198-200`` declares both ``ph`` and ``phb``
  with ``Z`` staggering, i.e. on FULL (w) levels.

So ``z_at_q`` is the **w-level geopotential height above sea level**, sampled
at the lowest ``kte`` full levels -- the array's name is misleading.
``hgt(i,1,j)`` is therefore the terrain elevation, which is exactly what the
ABSOLUTE 1000 m / 2500 m ``h_01`` thresholds are meant to test, and the profile
body uses the AGL difference ``hgt(k)-hgt(1)``.

WOOF's exact analogue is ``z8w[:nz]`` where
``z8w = (state.phb + state.php) / G``, which
``woof/core/microphysics.py::_apply_thompson`` already materializes at
lines 470-474 (and ``launch_kessler`` at :389 shows the mass-level form
``0.5*(z8w[:nz]+z8w[1:])`` for contrast -- that is what must NOT be used
here).  :func:`launch_aerosol_init_profile` therefore documents and validates
an ``(nz, ny, nx)`` w-level height; see :data:`INIT_PROFILE_HEIGHT_FIELD`.

Passing the mass-level height instead would raise ``hgt(i,1,j)`` by half a
layer everywhere, which flips the ``h_01`` branch for any column whose terrain
sits within half a layer of 1000 m or 2500 m and rescales ``niCCN3`` for every
column in between -- silently reshaping the entire synthetic CCN profile.

    ``qv`` and ``micro_columns`` (both or neither) carry WRF's column exit
    and vapour floor: a column :func:`launch_aerosol_micro_columns` marked 0
    is left exactly as it entered (WRF returned from it at :2020, before the
    terminal apply), and every level of every other column has its vapour
    floored at 1.E-10 (:3974).  The production adapter always passes them;
    without them only the accumulators are applied, which is what the unit
    gates of the terminal arithmetic drive.

    This is the ONLY place mp=28 writes ``nc``/``nwfa``/``nifa`` from the
    accumulators, and it carries WRF's only clamps.  Four other packages
    depend on that being true.

    ``qc`` is the FINAL per-kilogram cloud mixing ratio (the networks have
    already written it) and is zeroed in place on WRF's ``qc1d <= R1`` branch.
    ``nc``/``nwfa``/``nifa`` are the ENTRY per-kilogram state.

    ``rho`` IS NOT THE ENTRY DENSITY, and this used to say that it was.
    :3976, :4011, :4019 and :4020 all read ``rho(k)``, and by :3972 that is
    the TAU+1 value written at :3193, then per level at :3490 (condensation)
    and :3572 (rain evaporation); nothing after :3574 touches it.  MEASURED
    from an instrumented build of pristine ``module_mp_thompson.F`` that
    reproduces all 22 committed column fixtures byte for byte: the entry
    density is up to **7.4672e-03** away from it (aero-cold-overlap), and
    substituting it inside WRF itself moves ``nc1d`` at one of 504 fixture
    levels by **3.9271e-03** -- 1963x the 2.0e-06 end-to-end gate -- through
    :3976's ``2./rho(k)`` floor.

    The buffer to pass is the one :func:`launch_tau1_density` writes when it
    is called immediately AFTER the rain-evaporation launcher and BEFORE
    sedimentation: WOOF's ``temperature``/``qv`` hold WRF's ``temp(k)``/
    ``qv(k)`` exactly at that moment, and doing so reproduces WRF's terminal
    ``rho(k)`` bitwise at 501 of those 504 levels (worst 1.2334e-07).
    Recomputing it at the finalize call instead is 5.39e-05 off, because
    WOOF's ``temperature`` keeps absorbing the melt/freeze cleanup's ``tten``
    while WRF's ``temp(k)`` snapshot does not.  See
    ``tests/test_thompson_aerosol_state_gpu.py::
    test_terminal_apply_matches_wrfs_own_terminal_loop_on_every_fixture``,
    which drives this launcher on WRF's own terminal-loop state both ways.

    Each ``*_out`` may alias its corresponding input -- every thread reads its
    own element before writing it -- so the adapter can legally pass
    ``state.nc`` for both ``nc`` and ``nc_out``.

    Three of WRF's unit inconsistencies are reproduced literally and must not
    be "fixed":

    * :3976 compares the PER-KILOGRAM ``nc1d`` against the volumetric
      ``Nt_c_max``, while converting only the lower bound (``2./rho``);
    * :3979-3982 clamp per-kilogram ``nwfa1d``/``nifa1d`` against the per-m3
      constants ``11.1E6`` / ``5.0E3`` / ``9999.E6`` with no density at all;
    * :4020 caps the rediagnosed droplet number at ``Nt_c_max/rho``, i.e. the
      same constant, converted.

    So is one thing about the ARITHMETIC, and it is easy to lose.  :4012's
    lambda base, :4015/:4017's ``cce(2,nu_c)/D0c`` quotient and :4019's
    ``ccg(1,nu_c)*ocg2(nu_c)*qc1d/am_r`` prefactor are all REAL(4)
    sub-expressions whose results meet the DOUBLE ``lamc``.  nvrtc widens such
    a chain to double -- MEASURED, and a named ``float`` local does not stop
    it -- so the kernel pins them with ``__fmul_rn``/``__fdiv_rn``.  Without
    the pins the rediagnosed droplet number ran 2 to 3.5 float32 ulps hot on
    nearly every fixture, because :4019 CUBES the lambda.  With them, the
    kernel is BITWISE against a Fortran-faithful host transcription on all
    456 fixture states.

    ``z_at_q`` but ``dyn_em/start_em.F:873`` fills it from the Z-staggered
    ``ph_2 + phb``, so ``hgt(i,1,j)`` is the terrain elevation the absolute
    1000 m / 2500 m ``h_01`` thresholds test.

    Four things this reproduces that are easy to get wrong:

    * the ``k=1`` level uses the LEVEL-2 height difference, not zero;
    * ``h_01`` reads an ABSOLUTE height while the profile body uses the AGL
      difference ``hgt(k)-hgt(1)``;
    * ``nifa`` gets the same shape with ``naIN0``/``naIN1`` but there is NO
      2-D flux -- WRF never derives a ``nifa2d`` and it stays exactly zero;
    * ``nc`` is never touched by ``thompson_init``.  It stays 0 and is
      bootstrapped by the first call's terminal rediagnosis.

    """``calc_effectRad``:5594-5699 with a PROGNOSTIC droplet number.

    ``nc``/``ni`` are per-kilogram.  Outputs are MICRONS by default, matching
    woof's radiation-facing state contract and ``thompson.cu:373-381``: WRF's
    own ``mp_gt_driver:1476-1478`` clamps are applied first and the
    metre->micron multiply is the last operation.  Pass ``metres=True`` for
    raw ``calc_effectRad`` output in metres, which is what
    ``oracle-aero/probe-effectrad.csv`` records.

    The cloud branch is the only THREE-way shape selector in the scheme
    (:5637-5643) and the only consumer of the exact-integer ``g_ratio``
    PARAMETER (:5611-5613) rather than the runtime ``ccg(2,n)*ocg1(n)``
    product.  ``thompson_aa_inu_c_effrad`` and ``THOMPSON_AA_G_RATIO`` come
    from the shared device header; do not substitute ``thompson_aa_nu_c`` or
    ``2730.0f`` here.

    THE THREE BRANCH BODIES ARE NOW THE SHARED HEADER'S.
    ``thompson_aerosol_state.cu`` used to carry private pinned copies named
    ``thompson_aa_state_eff_rad_cloud``/``_ice``/``_snow``, because the shared
    ones left their float32 chains unpinned (nvrtc is free to evaluate such a
    chain in double, and WP-04 measured it doing exactly that elsewhere in
    this file).  The header pins all three now, with the identical
    ``__fmul_rn``/``__fdiv_rn``/``__fadd_rn`` spelling, so the copies are
    deleted.  PROVED INERT BEFORE DELETION: the three deleted bodies compiled
    alongside the shared ones in ONE translation unit agree BITWISE on 400 000
    randomized states.  ``thompson_field_a``/``thompson_field_b`` were already
    shared with the cold network's snow moments and stay that way.

    MEASURED against WRF, driving the kernel with the oracle's own post-step
    columns so no upstream residual is in the way:

    * all 19 committed fixtures x 24 levels x 3 fields: BITWISE, except FIVE
      levels that are proved to be the harness's own float32 temperature
      round trip (``run_column_aero.F90`` records ``theta*exner`` where
      ``mp_gt_driver:1357`` stored ``t1d/pii``) -- down from eight, because
      the harness repaired its own ``pii``, and each survivor is now proved at
      exactly ONE ulp where the search used to have to run to +-4;
    * ``probe-effectrad.csv``, all 50 rows: BITWISE (the probe grew from 14
      rows to 50 and now carries 14 temperatures and 22 distinct ``effs_m``
      values, where the 14-row version was one snow state repeated);
    * the REAL ``calc_effectRad``, called not transcribed, over 960 states
      (40 columns x 24 levels sweeping T 233-260 K, qc/nc/qi/ni/qs over four
      decades each): ``effc`` and ``effs`` BITWISE, ``effi`` 958/960 with the
      two survivors at 1.094592e-07 -- the double-rounding limit of
      ``(float)pow(double,double)`` against glibc's singly-rounded ``powf``,
      which plain CUDA ``powf`` does not fix either;
    * a 2400-state wide-range sweep against a float32 host transcription of
      :5624-5695: ``effc``/``effi`` BITWISE, ``effs`` bitwise at 2397 of 2400
      with the three exceptions attributed to the ~0.09% of arguments where
      glibc's ``powf`` and an evaluate-in-double-round-once ``powf`` disagree.

    Whatever an end-to-end gate sees in ``effc_m``/``effi_m`` is therefore
    INHERITED from ``qc``/``nc``/``qi``/``ni``, at one third of their relative
    error (``re ~ (r/n)**(1/3)``); that ratio is itself pinned by
    ``test_effective_radius_residual_is_inherited_from_qc_and_nc``.
