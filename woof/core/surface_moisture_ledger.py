"""Per-column accounting for where the published 2 m moisture came from.

WHY THIS EXISTS.  A 2 m dewpoint that collapses overnight can be blamed on
four different things, and the shipped record of the v1.6.2 Gulf-coast
report named one of them without ever separating it from the other three:

1. the lowest model level dried out (``QV1`` moved),
2. the surface endpoint or its exchange moved (``QSFC``, ``CQS2``, ``QFX``),
3. the 2 m diagnostic was written by a different provider than the one the
   causal story assumed, or written twice with the second writer silently
   winning, or
4. the mixing-ratio-to-dewpoint conversion in the product chain is wrong.

Each of those leaves a different signature, and this module records all four
at once so a run can be read rather than argued about.  Every row carries the
inputs, the provider's OWN formula re-evaluated from the published inputs
(``q2_expected``), and the difference (``q2_residual``).  A residual inside
the FP32 budget means the named provider really is the writer and its inputs
really are the ones recorded, so any moisture change must live in those
inputs.  A residual outside the budget means the accounting itself is wrong,
and the run's causal story cannot be trusted until that is explained.

THE LEDGER IS OPT-IN AND OFF BY DEFAULT.  It allocates nothing and costs
nothing until a caller attaches one, and it never writes to a physics field.

FP32 BUDGET.  The identities below are re-evaluated in FP64 from FP32
published inputs, so they cannot close better than the rounding of the
original FP32 arithmetic.  :data:`Q2_RESIDUAL_BUDGET_KG_KG` is the floor and
:data:`Q2_RESIDUAL_BUDGET_ULP` the relative term; a residual passes when it
is inside the LARGER of the two, which keeps the test meaningful at both
Antarctic (1e-5 kg/kg) and tropical (2e-2 kg/kg) mixing ratios.
