"""The two SASE constants the config and state layers need.

They live here, in a module with no imports at all, because of where
they have to be readable from.  The closure's authority module is
``woof.verify.sase_ref``, and ``woof/verify`` is a DEVELOPER
verification tree that the standalone CPU preprocessing distribution
deliberately omits -- so a config- or state-layer import of it breaks
that wheel (``tests/test_native_wrf_distribution.py`` is the gate that
says so, and it caught exactly that).

There is still ONE definition of each value: ``sase_ref`` imports them
from here rather than restating them, so the authority module's
constant registry and its configuration hash keep binding the same
numbers they always did.
