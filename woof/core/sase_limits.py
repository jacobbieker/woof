"""SASE constants shared by configuration, state and CPU memory accounting.

They live here, in a module with no imports at all, because of where
they have to be readable from.  The closure's authority module is
``woof.verify.sase_ref``, and ``woof/verify`` is a DEVELOPER
verification tree that the standalone CPU preprocessing distribution
deliberately omits -- so a config- or state-layer import of it breaks
that wheel (``tests/test_native_wrf_distribution.py`` is the gate that
says so, and it caught exactly that).

There is ONE definition of each value. ``sase_ref`` imports the column
limit and energy floor from here, preserving its constant registry and
configuration hash. The CUDA launch tier and CPU workspace estimator
share the reduction block size through this same import-free module.
