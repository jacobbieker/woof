"""Forecast adapter for WRF v4.6.1 Thompson aerosol-aware (``mp_physics=28``).

:func:`_apply_thompson_aerosol` is a **sibling** of
``woof.core.microphysics._apply_thompson``, not a branch inside it.  That is
deliberate and essential: the classic function body stays textually
diffable against its model-validated form, so ``tests/test_mp8_frozen.py``'s
receipts and any future ``git diff`` can prove mp=8 was not touched by this
port.  The cost is a copied skeleton; the benefit is that "mp=8 is frozen" is
a statement about bytes rather than about control flow.

Numerical authority is ``wrf461-pristine/phys/module_mp_thompson.F``
(WRF v4.6.1, commit ``d66e442``).  Bare ``:NNNN`` line numbers refer to it.

THE FIVE THINGS THIS FILE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR
--------------------------------------------
Every kernel below was unit-gated by its own package against the Fortran
oracle before this adapter existed.  Unit gates cannot see composition
defects, so the five properties this file uniquely owns are stated here and
each is pinned by a named test in ``tests/test_thompson_aerosol_adapter.py``:

1.  **The accumulator contract.**  ``state.nc`` / ``state.nwfa`` /
    ``state.nifa`` are READ-ONLY entry state for the whole call.  The three
    scratch accumulators are ZEROED at entry (they are persistent scratch --
    ``state.scratch`` survives across steps by design, ``state.py:710-735`` --
    so carrying last step's aerosol tendency forward would be a slow,
    plausible-looking drift no single-step column test could catch), written
    by every aerosol kernel, and applied EXACTLY ONCE by
    ``launch_aerosol_state_finalize`` (:3972-4021), which carries WRF's only
    clamps.
    Pinned by ``test_entry_state_is_read_only_until_the_single_terminal_apply``
    and ``test_accumulators_are_zeroed_at_entry_not_carried_between_calls``.

2.  **Warm/cold entry-mask disjointness.**  The cold network returns for
    ``T >= 273.15`` and the warm network returns unless its held mask is set,
    and both kernel headers state that the two gates are exact complements.
    That is only true if the mask is captured on the **entry** temperature,
    BEFORE the cold network writes its latent heating in place.  Capturing it
    afterwards lets a cold cell that the cold network heated across 0 C run
    the warm path as well, double-counting ``pnc_wau``/``pnc_rcw``/
    ``pna_rca``/``pnd_rcd`` at that level -- finite, stable and wrong.
    Pinned by ``test_warm_entry_mask_is_captured_before_the_cold_network``.

3.  **Launch order.**  Surface emission is the LAST aerosol write of the call
    and follows the terminal apply (mp_gt_driver:1310-1327 runs after
    ``mp_thompson`` returns, so it is deliberately unclamped).  The ``ncten``
    balance limiter (:2996-3019) runs ONCE, between the warm network and the
    saturation adjustment -- WRF applies it once per column after every
    ``ncten`` source and before ``pnc_wcd``; calling it from inside both
    networks double-applies it.
    Pinned by ``test_launcher_call_order_is_exactly_the_wrf_driver_order``.

4.  **No Cooper.**  In mp=28 ``iceDeMott`` REPLACES Cooper nucleation
    (:2537-2551 selects one or the other on ``is_aerosol_aware``).  The
    classic ``launch_frozen_vapor_network*`` / ``launch_ice_nucleation``
    launchers carry Cooper and must never appear on this path; using them
    would ADD a second ice source rather than substitute for it.
    Pinned by ``test_no_cooper_bearing_classic_launcher_is_ever_called``.

5.  **Which density feeds which kernel.**  WRF keeps TWO air densities in
    play across the condensation seam and uses both.  :3193 diagnoses the
    TAU+1 density; :3242-3243 builds the working rain mass and number from
    it and :3384-3388 freezes ``ilamr``/``N0_r`` from those; :3490 then
    OVERWRITES ``rho(k)`` inside the condensation loop and :3505-3520's
    ``orho``/``rhof``/``vsc2``/``rvs`` read the newer one.  ``prv_rev`` and
    ``pnr_rev`` therefore scale with the OLDER density while everything
    around them scales with the newer.  Both kernels expose exactly what
    they need -- ``launch_aerosol_saturation_adjust`` writes the :3193
    density into ``reference_density`` unconditionally, and
    ``launch_aerosol_rain_evaporation`` takes it as ``entry_density`` -- so
    the only thing that can get this wrong is the wiring in this file, and
    getting it wrong scales rain evaporation by ``rho_post/rho_pre``: 1.9e-3
    on aero-reduces-to-classic, which was the port's ONLY carved-out
    end-to-end tolerance until WP-12a.
    Pinned by
    ``test_the_adapter_hands_rain_evaporation_wrfs_pre_condensation_density``
    and ``test_suppressing_the_pre_condensation_density_reproduces_the_old_
    defect``.

5b. **And which density SEDIMENTATION reads, which is a third decision.**
    ``launch_rain_sedimentation`` forms its sedimenting rain mass and number
    as ``qr*rho`` and ``nr*rho`` from the ``reference_density`` it is handed;
    those are WRF's ``rr(k)``/``nr(k)`` at :3794-3795, and WRF builds them in
    exactly two places -- :3237-3238 from the :3193 TAU+1 density at every
    level with ``L_qr``, and :3568-3570 from the :3490 post-condensation
    density ONLY where the :3501-3502 rain-evaporation gate passed.  So the
    correct buffer is a LEVEL-WISE MIXTURE, not either density.
    ``launch_aerosol_rain_evaporation`` produces exactly that mixture in its
    ``reference_density`` output: it writes ``entry_density`` by default and
    overwrites with its own post-condensation rho after all three of WRF's
    gates pass.  Before WP-13a it wrote the post-condensation rho
    unconditionally, which gave every level the :3568 answer including the
    ones WRF never rewrote -- worth 5.165e-04 on aero-drop-evap's RAINNC
    (whose column passes the gate at NO level, so the :3237 pair should have
    stood everywhere) and 1.279e-04 on aero-ice-demott-idxin's.  Both
    fixtures now clear the flat G3 gate.
    Pinned by ``test_rain_sedimentation_gets_wrfs_level_wise_working_rain_
    density`` and, at the kernel, by tests/test_thompson_aerosol_sat_gpu.py::
    ``test_rain_evaporation_exports_the_sedimentation_density_wrf_actually_
    used``.

    WHAT WAS WRONG THERE, AND HOW IT CLOSED: the shared rain fallout
    re-applied WRF's :3240-3250 ``mvd_r`` clamp at sedimentation time, which
    :3568-3570 does not carry, and gated rain presence on a MIXING RATIO
    where :3616 tests a MASS CONCENTRATION built only where L_qr holds.  The
    clamp is gone from thompson_rain_sediment_impl, and both schemes' rain
    evaporations now hand the fallout WRF's L_qr and the :3568 rewrite in
    this density (zero where :3236 failed, negative where :3568 floored the
    pair), read by the ``_with_presence`` entry points this adapter launches
    and, since the classic rain fallout repair (7727fda3c), microphysics.py
    launches for mp=8 as well.  ``test_the_two_residuals_that_live_in_the_frozen_kernel_
    are_measured_here`` keeps the record of both.

WHAT IS REUSED FROM THE FROZEN mp=8 MODULE, AND WHY THAT IS SOUND
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Eight launchers come from ``woof.core.thompson`` unchanged:

* ``launch_classic_graupel_number_init`` / ``_finalize`` -- ``is_hail_aware``
  is false for mp=8 and mp=28 alike, so the ``idx_bg1 = 5`` / ``rho_g = 400``
  classic graupel-number diagnostic is bit-identical.
* ``launch_hydrometeor_column_mask`` (twice) and
  ``launch_graupel_fallout_column_mask`` -- pure column reductions over mass.
* ``launch_ice_sedimentation`` / ``_snow_`` / ``_graupel_`` / ``_rain_`` --
  :3790-3936 contains no ``is_aerosol_aware`` branch and no nc/nwfa/nifa
  reference.  ``nwfa`` and ``nifa`` have NO sedimentation term anywhere in
  module_mp_thompson.F; any implementation that adds one is wrong.

They are called with the identical ordered argument tuples mp=8 uses, which
``test_reused_classic_launchers_receive_the_mp8_argument_shape`` pins.

ENTRY-STATE ALIASING (why there are no ``nc_entry`` scratch copies)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
``launch_aerosol_entry_cloud_number`` reproduces :1826-1848 including its
in-place side effect: ``qc1d`` and ``nc1d`` are ZEROED wherever
``qc1d <= R1`` (:1844-1845).  After that call ``state.nc`` *is* WRF's
``nc1d``, and nothing writes ``state.nc`` again until the terminal apply at
step 13 -- so ``state.nc`` itself is passed as the ``nc_entry`` argument
everywhere, with no copy.  The same holds for ``state.nwfa``/``state.nifa``,
which no kernel between the entry snapshot and the finalize writes at all.
``woof/core/preflight.py``'s mp=28 slot registry reflects exactly this: it
budgets ``qc_entry`` and ``ni_entry`` copies and no ``nc_entry`` copy.

def thompson_aerosol_init_fill(state: DomainState, cfg: RunConfig) -> dict:
    """``thompson_init``'s synthetic CCN/IN profile, ONCE per domain.

    Invoke from the physics INIT path, never per step.  WRF calls
    ``thompson_init`` from ``phys/module_physics_init.F:4517-4544`` at domain
    construction; nothing in ``mp_gt_driver`` ever refills the profile, and a
    per-step call would overwrite an advected, scavenged aerosol field with
    the synthetic one every step while leaving every bound intact.

    Returns ``{'ccn': bool, 'in': bool}`` -- which of the two independent
    fills ran.  A domain can legitimately get one and not the other:
    ``thompson_init`` makes the CCN decision at :493 and the IN decision at
    :530 from two separate ``MAXVAL`` reductions.

    THE HEIGHT FIELD.  ``hgt`` is ``z8w[:nz]``, the FULL (w) level
    geopotential height above sea level.  WRF's argument is named ``z_at_q``
    but ``dyn_em/start_em.F:870-876`` fills it from the Z-staggered
    ``ph_2 + phb``, so ``hgt(i,1,j)`` is the terrain elevation the ABSOLUTE
    1000 m / 2500 m ``h_01`` thresholds test.  See
    ``woof.core.thompson_aerosol_state``'s module docstring.

    THE TILE-BOUND DIFFERENCE, stated rather than silently absorbed.  WRF's
    presence test reduces over ``nwfa(its:ite-1,:,jts:jte-1)`` (:489/:526)
    while its fill loop covers ``i = its..min(ide-1,ite)`` (:499-500) -- the
    test excludes the last mass column and row that the fill then writes.
    That asymmetry is in WRF, not a transcription slip.  woof's ``(ny, nx)``
    arrays are the mass grid with no staggered extra, so
    :func:`~woof.core.thompson_aerosol_state.aerosol_profile_needs_fill`
    reduces over the WHOLE mass grid and therefore INCLUDES the one column
    and one row WRF's test omits.  The two can only disagree if a domain has
    aerosol in exactly that outermost column/row and nowhere else, in which
    case woof declines the fill and WRF performs it.  woof's behaviour is
    the safer of the two (it never overwrites real aerosol data), and the
    difference is unreachable for the only supported v1 ingest, which is
    all-zero or all-filled.
