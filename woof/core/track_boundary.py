    This is a conservative diagnostic limit: it does not infer a position

    fields and an extremum on an interior search-window edge do not prove exit.

    ``extremum`` NAMES WHICH END OF THE FIELD IS THE CENTRE, and it has no
    default on purpose. A cyclone is a pressure MINIMUM, rotation and echo
    are MAXIMA, and a tracked attribute is whichever its own configuration
    says -- so a caller that did not state the sense would be asking whether
    the field's weakest cell had reached the edge, which for every maximum
    signal is a different question with the same answer shape: silently
    wrong, and wrong in the direction that ends a live track. The one caller
    reads the sense from :func:`woof.core.storm_tracking.extremum_kind`,
    which is also what the receipt's ``extremum_kind`` is written from, so
    the row and this test cannot disagree about what was being tracked.
