"""Bit-faithful reproductions of the glibc 2.39 FP32 libm calls WRF makes.

Not Noah-MP-specific despite the module name (the Noah-MP lane owns the
``noahmp_*`` namespace; promote this to a shared module when another lane needs
it).

Why this exists
---------------
The oracle is gfortran 13.3.0 linked against glibc 2.39, so ``EXP``, ``LOG``,
``LOG10`` and ``**`` on ``REAL(4)`` become calls to glibc's ``expf``, ``logf``,
``log10f`` and ``powf``.  **None of those four is correctly rounded.**  Rounding
the FP64 result once -- the shim the MYNN lane uses, and the obvious thing to
do -- disagrees with glibc on a large fraction of the domain:

| call      | domain swept                    | disagreement with FP64-then-round |
|-----------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------:|
| ``log10f``| every FP32 in (0.1, 1.0]        |            5,266,896 / 28,521,268 = **18.47%** |
| ``expf``  | FP32 grid over \\|x\\| <= 25      |               21,750 / 34,902,602 = 0.062% |
| ``powf``  | 4e6 samples over Noah-MP shapes |                       2,618 / 4e6 = 0.065% |

So TDFCND's ``LOG10(SATRATIO)`` cannot reach ``max_ulp 0`` through an FP64
shim: roughly one soil column in five lands on the wrong side of the rounding
boundary.  That is not a tolerance to loosen, it is the wrong function.

What this is
------------
Direct transcriptions of the glibc 2.39 implementations:

* ``logf``   -- ``sysdeps/ieee754/flt-32/e_logf.c`` + ``e_logf_data.c``
  (ARM optimized-routines: 16-entry table, cubic in ``r``, FP64 intermediate,
  one rounding to FP32 at the end).
* ``log10f`` -- ``sysdeps/ieee754/flt-32/e_log10f.c``, which is still the 1993
  SunPro reduction ``log10(x) = k*log10_2 + log10(e)*logf(z)`` evaluated in
  **FP32** on top of ``logf``.  This is why ``log10f`` is so much less accurate
  than ``logf``.
* ``expf``   -- ``sysdeps/ieee754/flt-32/e_expf.c`` + ``e_exp2f_data.c``
  (32-entry ``2^(i/32)`` table, the shift-trick round-to-int, cubic in ``r``).
* ``powf``   -- ``sysdeps/ieee754/flt-32/e_powf.c`` + ``e_powf_log2_data.c``
  (a 16-entry ``log2`` table feeding the same ``exp2`` core).

``TOINT_INTRINSICS`` is 0 on x86-64, so ``POWF_SCALE`` is 1.0 and the shift
trick is used in both ``exp2`` paths; both are reproduced as glibc compiles
them for this target.

Verification (all against the live glibc 2.39 on the oracle host, C
transcription compiled with ``-ffp-contract=off`` and again with
``-mfma -ffp-contract=fast``, identical results):

* ``logf``  : 222,414,918 FP32 inputs swept over (0.1,1], [1,100], [1e-6,0.1]
  -- **0 mismatches**.
* ``log10f``: the same 222,414,918 inputs -- **0 mismatches**.
* ``powf``  : 6,000,000 samples over the Noah-MP bases (7.7, 2.0, 2.2, 0.57)
  and broad random ``(base, exponent)`` -- **0 mismatches**.
* ``expf``  : 146,800,642 FP32 inputs over \\|x\\| <= 80 -- **2 mismatches**,
  both 1 ULP: ``x = 0x4202422F`` (32.5646324) and ``x = 0xC27C65D9``
  (-63.0994606).  Residual rate 1.4e-8, a 4,400x improvement on the FP64
  shim.  Diagnosis: glibc's x86-64 multiarch ``expf`` is selected at run time
  and is not byte-identical to the generic C at those two points; enabling FMA
  contraction in the transcription does not move either, so it is not a
  contraction artefact.  Any Noah-MP column that lands on one of those two
  exact FP32 arguments will miss ``max_ulp 0`` by 1 ULP and must be reported,
  not absorbed.

The CUDA halves of these functions live in
``woof/core/kernels/noahmp_leaves.cu`` and must stay in step with this file.

Two independent transcriptions, and what they measured about each other
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The five Noah-MP leaf lanes (vegprecip, radiation, bareflux, vegeflux, snow)
arrived carrying a second transcription of ``logf``/``expf``/``powf``/``atanf``
and a third of ``logf``/``atanf``, written independently from the same glibc
2.39 sources.  They differed in one interesting way: the second transcription
put an explicit :func:`math.fma` at every ``a*b + c`` site in ``logf``,
``expf`` and ``powf``'s ``log2``, on the argument that glibc ifunc-selects the
``-mfma`` rebuild (``__logf_fma``, ``__powf_fma``) on an FMA host, and that
``logc + k*Ln2`` in particular is a single FMA in the disassembly.  This file
contracts nothing.

Both were run against each other over 10,500,000 argument pairs and both
against the 30,000 pinned glibc words in
``woof/data/noahmp/oracle/glibc-libm-fp32.csv`` and the 4,256 in
``glibc-atanf-fp32.csv``: **zero disagreements, on every function, in every
sweep**.  The FMA sites are real in the disassembly and they do change the
binary64 intermediate, but not by enough to move the single rounding to
binary32 at the end on any argument either lane could find.  That is a
measured null result, not a proof; it is recorded here because it is the only
independent check these transcriptions will ever get.  This file keeps the
non-FMA form for a second reason as well: :func:`math.fma` is CPython 3.13+,
and the GPU host this project validates on runs 3.12.

Only this file survived the merge.  ``sqrtf`` and :func:`f32` came across from
the leaf lanes; ``log10f`` exists only here.

    """Round to float32 and hand it back as a Python float.

    Round-to-nearest-even, which is what a C ``(float)`` cast and a Fortran
    ``REAL(4)`` assignment both do.  The leaf lanes use this rather than
    ``np.float32`` to keep every intermediate a Python float: a chain of
    Python-float operations rounded once per Fortran statement reproduces
    float32 arithmetic exactly, because binary32 -> binary64 -> binary32 is an
    innocuous double rounding for ``+ - * /`` (53 >= 2*24 + 2).

    An argument outside the float32 range raises ``OverflowError`` rather than
    saturating to an infinity.  That is a guard, not a hazard: a Fortran
    ``REAL(4)`` overflow is a physics bug, and none of the leaves reach one.

    ``_pack``/``_unpack`` are default arguments, not globals, so the body does
    no name lookup outside the frame.  Both are bound methods of the module
    ``Struct`` above; a caller that passes them explicitly gets the same
    function, and a caller that rebinds them is out of contract.

    Four alternative carriers were measured on the reference box against a
    21-value probe set (both zeros, the smallest subnormal, the largest finite
    binary32, the first value that overflows it, both infinities and a NaN).
    Two of them are faster and none of them is this function:

    carrier                 ns/call   how it differs
    ======================  ========  =========================================
    ``struct`` (this one)     229.8   --
    ``ctypes.c_float``        133.7   saturates an overflow to an infinity
    ``array('f')``            162.2   saturates an overflow to an infinity
    ``array('f')`` + guard    194.2   identical, but reads and writes one
                                      module-level buffer, so two threads in
                                      ``f32`` can interleave and return each
                                      other's value
    ``float(np.float32(x))``  481.4   saturates, and warns while doing it
    ======================  ========  =========================================

    The guarded ``array`` variant is the only bit-identical one, and 15% is
    not worth a carrier that is silently wrong under concurrency.  What was
    taken instead is :data:`F32_PACK`/:data:`F32_UNPACK`: the same two calls,
    inlined into the one caller hot enough to notice the frame.

#   FSNO = TANH( SNOWH / (parameters%SCFFAC * FMELT) )       (:2072)
# and that single call is enough to put every snow column's answer through
# glibc's tanhf.  It is *not* interchangeable with an FP64 shim: over the
# 204,064,836 FP32 inputs in [1e-6, 22], `(float)tanh((double)x)` disagrees
# with glibc's `tanhf` on 48,501,304 of them -- 23.8%, three orders of
# magnitude worse than expf's 0.062%.  These are still the 1993 SunPro
# routines in glibc 2.39, unlike logf/expf/powf above, which is why they are
# so much less accurate.
#
# Verified against the live glibc 2.39 on the oracle host (gcc -O2
# -ffp-contract=off): 1,106,247,680 FP32 inputs over (0, 30] -- **0
# mismatches**.  The CUDA half lives in woof/core/kernels/noahmp_energy.cu
