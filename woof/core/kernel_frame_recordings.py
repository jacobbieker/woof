"""Per-thread local-frame tables, one per compile platform that read one.

``woof.core.preflight`` prices the launch-time local-memory backing
store from the widest per-thread frame the selected kernel set compiles
to, and that reservation --
``(frame - default stack) x SMs x threads per SM`` -- is the largest
single non-pool term in the device budget.  Until 2026-08-20 the frames
lived in ``preflight`` as one flat dict whose provenance was prose, and
the gate that regenerates it asserted EXACT equality on whatever machine
happened to run it.  Both were wrong in the same way: a frame is what
NVRTC emitted for ONE target architecture at ONE compiler build, not a
property of the ``.cu`` source.

Measured the same NVRTC-plus-driver way on three compile platforms
(``tools/vram_reserve_probe.py frames``), the rows that disagree (the
sm_120 columns as re-read 2026-09-28, the sm_86 column as read
2026-08-20/21 and re-read at the cut):

``gf``, ``ysu`` and ``kf`` are the three rows that went to ZERO-ish on
every platform, and they are the reason this file exists in its present
shape.  All three kernels kept a whole column in the per-thread local
frame; on 2026-08-21 all three moved those arrays into a global
workspace (``woof/core/kernels/gf.cu``, ``ysu.cu``, ``kf.cu``).  ``gf``
went 22,416 -> 88 B, ``ysu`` 9,232 -> 0 B, ``kf`` 24,064 -> 512 B.

``shinhong`` took the same route on 2026-09-30: its column arrays moved
into a global workspace sized to the columns in flight, 17,160 -> 0 B.
Every recording below was RE-READ at the new source that day rather
than carried over: sm_120 on an RTX 5090 through the production loader
under NVRTC 13.0.48, 13.0.88, 13.3.33 and 13.4.92, sm_89 on an RTX 4090
under 13.4.92, and sm_86 compile-only (NVRTC 13.0.48 PTX through ptxas
13.0.48, ``-v``), because the RTX 3080 stays out of GPU work.  All read
0 B, so the recordings keep their completeness claims.

``kf``'s 512 B is not a failed zero: ``tv_env`` and ``positive_energy``
stay on its stack on purpose, because they are the only two of its 54
column arrays whose placement moves an output bit.  512 B is half the
default stack, so the row still reserves nothing.

``ysu`` is the one that mattered to users: ``bl_pbl_physics = 1`` is the
wizard's default, so YSU's frame was the widest a BARE DEFAULT run
LAUNCHED, and MEASURED on a development machine (RTX 5070 Ti, sm_120) it was
holding an 842.0 MiB launch-time reservation on every default run.

The sm_86 rows were briefly DROPPED on the theory that the RTX 3080 was
off limits and could not be re-read.  That turned out to be wrong -- the
card is in the machine and the GPU test suite already runs on it -- so on
2026-08-21 all three were RE-READ there at the post-workspace source
rather than left as holes or back-filled from another platform.  They
agree with sm_120: 88 B, 0 B and 512 B.  This recording is COMPLETE
again.

COMPLETE is a claim about the ``.cu`` files that compile ALONE, and those
are the whole key domain of a ``frames`` mapping: both readers --
``tools/vram_reserve_probe.py`` (``mode_frames``) and
``tests/test_preflight.py::test_the_recorded_local_frames_match_the_driver``
-- enumerate ``woof/core/kernels/*.cu`` and drop whatever NVRTC refuses
standalone.  Three translation units the model actually LAUNCHES are
therefore outside every table here, because they exist only as
compositions: ``rrtmg_lw_legacy_chain``, ``rrtmg_sw_legacy`` and
``p3_composed`` (P3 one-category, ``mp_physics = 50``).  They are priced
from ``preflight.CHAINED_TRANSLATION_UNIT_FRAMES`` instead, and they may
not be moved here: a chained-unit key in a ``frames`` mapping raises at
import, because :func:`frame_ceiling` is checked for EXACT equality against
``preflight.KERNEL_MAX_LOCAL_SIZE_BYTES``
(``woof/core/preflight.py:1663``) and a chained unit is barred from that
table by construction (``:2002``).  So the absence is structural rather
than an oversight -- and it has a price, which is why
:data:`CHAINED_UNITS_WITHOUT_A_PER_PLATFORM_ROW` records it per unit: each
is priced on EVERY platform from ONE reading, and
``under_priced_kernel_frames`` cannot report a drifting one, because its
``observed`` argument comes from that same ``.cu`` enumeration.

The platform-independent claims still live in tests, because a box with no
row here at all is the case those protect:
``tests/test_gf_workspace.py``, ``tests/test_ysu_workspace.py`` and
``tests/test_kf_workspace.py`` each assert the frame stays under the
1,024 B default stack on ANY card.

A NOTE ON WHAT THESE ROWS ARE, because it is easy to over-read them: the
driver takes the reservation at LAUNCH, not at module load.  MEASURED on
a development machine 2026-08-21 with a two-kernel module -- compiling a module holding
a 16,384 B kernel reserved 0.0 MiB, and the 1,574.0 MiB appeared only
when that kernel was actually launched.  So a row here is a CEILING over
what a module could cost, and a module whose widest kernel a given
configuration never launches costs less than its row.  ``thompson`` is
the standing example: its 11,264 B is the ``KMAX=256`` template, and a
run with nz <= 64 launches only the ``_64`` variants (2,816 B measured).
Pricing the row is the safe direction and is what preflight does; it is
not what the driver charges.

Rows move with the ARCHITECTURE at a fixed compiler, with the COMPILER
BUILD at a fixed architecture, or with both (``noahmp_leaves``,
``shinhong``).  A row also moves with the SOURCE, and that is what the
2026-09-28 re-read found: every sm_120 recording was read again on an RTX
5090 (a development machine) and an RTX 5070 Ti (a development machine), the two cards
agreeing to the byte at every build, and three rows had gone stale.
``rrtmgp_rte`` still carried 5,152 B on 13.0.48 and 13.3.33, a reading
of the source before the RRTMGP optimisation (every build now compiles it
to 3,600), and ``gf`` (88 -> 72) and ``shinhong`` (14,040 -> 13,000) had
narrowed on 13.0.48 and 13.0.88 since those rows were read.  Stale-wide
rows are the safe direction, but not free: ``rrtmgp_rte`` was the widest
frame a Morrison, Kessler, P3 or microphysics-free configuration with
RRTMGP radiation launched, so every such run reserved backing store for
frame bytes no compiler emits (32 B per resident thread over Morrison's
5,120, the whole 1,552 B where nothing else is wider than 3,600).  The
sm_86 column predates the same source changes and is re-read at the cut,
so ``gf`` keeps its 88 B ceiling from it until then.  So the identity of
a recording is the pair
``(device_compute_capability, nvrtc_build)`` -- exactly two of the keys
:func:`woof.certify.compile_platform.compile_platform_fingerprint`
already measures -- and neither the card's SM count nor its model name
belongs in it (the SM count is priced separately, off the live device).

``preflight.KERNEL_MAX_LOCAL_SIZE_BYTES`` is the element-wise MAXIMUM
over these tables, checked against them at import.  A rail gate that does
not know which platform it is on must never price BELOW a measurement:
one byte of under-priced frame is one byte times the whole
resident-thread capacity of device memory nobody charged for.  Adding a
fourth platform is adding a row here; nothing else changes.

#: The same RTX 3080, read 2026-09-11 through the SHIPPED desktop
#: runtime instead of a CUDA-13 checkout environment: the interpreter
#: ArWen 2.7.2 installs carries cupy-cuda12x 14.2.0 and
#: nvidia-cuda-nvrtc-cu12 12.9.86, which is what
#: ``cupy-cuda12x[ctk]>=14.0`` resolves to (see
#: :data:`RESOLVED_TOOLCHAIN_PINS`), so sm_86 / NVRTC 12.9.86 is the
#: compile platform of every desktop install of this release.  CUDA
#: driver version read beside it: 13030.
#:
#: PARTIAL ON PURPOSE, and the reason is the reading's bound rather than
#: a hole: it is the CALIBRATION of the Noah-MP composed row for this
#: platform below, so it read the eight standalone stems whose values
#: this architecture's 13.0.48 recording already holds and which are the
#: ones known to move -- the three post-workspace frames (``gf``, ``kf``,
#: ``ysu``), the two rows that move with the ARCHITECTURE at a fixed
#: compiler (``noah`` 224, ``thompson_aerosol_warm`` 112), the one that
#: moves with the COMPILER BUILD at a fixed architecture
#: (``nssl2_fused_gs``), and ``milbrandt2`` / ``nest_microphysics`` as a
#: wide and a zero control.  Same instrument as the rest of the census
#: (``woof.core.kernels.load_module``, then ``local_size_bytes`` over
#: every exported ``__global__``, widest per module), fresh process,
#: empty CuPy cache, zero launches.
#:
#: WHAT IT MEASURED: all eight reproduce their NVRTC 13.0.48 value on
#: this card to the byte, so the 13.0.48 -> 12.9.86 step moved none of
#: them on sm_86.  That is a statement about these eight stems and these
#: two builds; it licenses nothing about the stems that were not read,
#: which is why ``complete`` is False and no other key is written here.
#: The ceiling does not move: every value is at or below the element-wise
#: maximum the other recordings already carry.

    # ``p3.cu`` borrows the tree's single audited glibc r_pow/r_exp/r_log
    # from ``noahmp_leaves.cu`` rather than carrying a second copy that
    # could drift, so it fails NVRTC standalone, sits in
    # ``preflight.UNMEASURED_KERNEL_MODULES``, and no ``*.cu`` glob can
    # reach it.  ``p3`` therefore has no measurable frame at all and a row
    # for it would be a value nothing measured, which is exactly what the
    # ``complete`` flag above exists to refuse.
    #
    # WHY THE 0 B IS STRUCTURAL, not lucky: ``p3.cu`` declares no
    # per-thread column array anywhere.  All eighteen ``(nk, ncol)``
    # companions -- twelve carriers and six of shared sedimentation
    # workspace, 72 B per grid cell -- live in the global workspace

    # move ``gf.cu``, ``ysu.cu`` and ``kf.cu`` each made to get their own
    # frames to nothing.  P3's state inventory is what makes that cheap:
    # ONE ice category with a rime pair (qir mass, qib volume) and no qs
    # and no qg at all, so there is no snow or graupel column to carry.
    #
    # WHAT IS NOT STRUCTURAL: spilling.  The widest kernel of the unit,

    # ``p3k_fused_process`` at 250, against a 255-register ceiling, so a

    # whole frame times the resident-thread capacity, and nothing in the

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ComposedUnitFrameRecording:
    """One compile platform's compile/load-only reading of the Noah-MP
    runtime translation units.

    WHAT IT MEASURES.  Each of the fifteen units in
    :data:`woof.core.noahmp_kernel_sources.NOAHMP_TRANSLATION_UNITS` was
    compiled through the one production factory
    (:func:`woof.core.noahmp_kernel_sources.compile_runtime_unit`, the
    same source string and option tuple a forecast hands NVRTC) in a
    fresh process with an empty CuPy cache, and every exported
    ``__global__`` of the loaded module was asked for
    ``CU_FUNC_ATTRIBUTE_LOCAL_SIZE_BYTES`` (``get_function(...).attributes
    ["local_size_bytes"]``).  ``frames`` is the maximum of that attribute
    over the unit's exports, keyed by the unit's pricing key.  No kernel
    was launched and no constant table was uploaded; a frame is a compile
    attribute, and the driver takes the reservation it prices at launch.

    WHY THESE ROWS ARE NOT IN A :class:`KernelFrameRecording`.  Five of
    the units are compositions (``noahmp_leaves.cu`` prepended to a
    fragment that borrows its r_pow/r_exp/r_log), so no ``*.cu`` glob
    reaches them and they may not carry a key in ``frames`` mappings the
    standalone ceiling is checked against.  They are priced from their
    own table: a card whose compile platform has a row here is priced
    from that row, and a card whose platform has none is priced from the
    element-wise ceiling over these rows -- the same rule the standalone
    census applies to an unrecorded platform -- with the basis printed
    beside the number so a user can see which of the two they got
    (:func:`woof.core.noahmp_frame_provenance.frame_basis_for_profile`).
    The reading ``noahmp_leaves`` alone gives across the standalone
    platforms above (272 / 208 / 272 B) is the demonstration that the
    frame moves with the compiler build, which is why the row is keyed
    on the pair and why the ceiling, never an average or the nearest
    row, is what an unread pair is charged.  Adding a platform is adding
    a row, taken with ``tools/measure_noahmp_frames.py measure`` on that
    card; from then on that card is priced exactly.

    ``unit_identity`` binds each row to the exact unit it read:
    :meth:`woof.core.noahmp_kernel_sources.RuntimeUnit.identity`'s
    ``identity_sha256`` at measurement time (ordered component hashes,
    the common preamble, the full composed source, the option tuple and
    every exported kernel).  A source or option edit changes the digest,
    the row stops matching the tree and is withdrawn from both the exact
    match and the ceiling until the platform is re-read; with no usable
    row left at all the estimator refuses --
    ``tests/test_noahmp_frame_provenance.py`` makes a stale row a red CPU
    test rather than a silent stale price.

    # 12.9.2.0, which pins nvidia-cuda-nvrtc-cu12 12.9.86; re-resolved
    # against the live index on 2026-09-11 (`python
    # tools/measure_noahmp_frames.py resolve --extra gpu-cu12`, exit 0)
    # and read the same day inside a venv installed from that
    # requirement, with the same instrument and the same fresh-process
    # discipline as the rows above (fifteen units, 108 exports, empty
    # CuPy cache, zero launches).
    #
    # Why the row exists: gpu-cu12 is not a minority spelling.  It is
    # what `recast-woof[gpu]` and `recast-woof[all]` alias to, and it is what the
    # packaged desktop runtime installs, so before this reading every
    # CUDA-12 install refused sf_surface_physics = 4 by name on every
    # card while carrying no way to reach the scheme at all.
    #
    # WHAT MOVED against the 13.x rows on this same card, and why it is
    # the compiler: noahmp_leaves reads 272 B here against 208 B at
    # 13.3.33 / 13.4.59, and the two units whose maximum IS the leaves
    # frame move with it (noahmp_energy_composed and
    # noahmp_libm_slab_composed, 208 -> 272); noahmp_driver_composed
    # reads 288 B against 352 B.  Every other unit is unmoved
    # (noahmp_glacier_composed 456, noahmp_thermal_composed 368,
    # noahmp_snow 200, noahmp_water 224, the rest 0).  That leaves value
    # is the one the standalone census already records for the older
    # compiler family on this architecture -- SM120_NVRTC_13_0_48 and
    # SM120_NVRTC_13_0_88 both read noahmp_leaves 272 -- and this
    # reading's three standalone stems agree with the 13.0.88 row to the
    # byte (leaves 272, snow 200, water 224), which is the cross-check
    # that the instrument and the standalone census are looking at the
    # same compiler.
    #
    # WHAT IT PRICES: the widest unit is noahmp_glacier_composed at
    # 456 B, under the 1,024 B fresh default stack, so Noah-MP adds 0 B
    # to the launch-time reservation on this platform too.

    # development-desktop, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 (68 SMs x 1,536),

    # DESKTOP install of this release.  Read 2026-09-11 with `python
    # tools/measure_noahmp_frames.py measure` through the interpreter the
    # shipped ArWen 2.7.2 desktop runtime installs, which carries
    # cupy-cuda12x 14.2.0 and nvidia-cuda-nvrtc-cu12 12.9.86: exactly what
    # `cupy-cuda12x[ctk]>=14.0` resolves to (:data:`RESOLVED_TOOLCHAIN_PINS`),
    # so the reading is of the compiler the user's own installation
    # compiles on rather than of a checkout environment beside it.  Same
    # instrument and same discipline as the two rows above: fresh process,
    # empty CuPy cache, compile_runtime_unit for each of the fifteen units,
    # function attributes on all 108 exports, zero launches.
    #
    # Why the row exists: the desktop runtime is CUDA-12, and with only the
    # two sm_120 / NVRTC 13.x rows every desktop install refused
    # sf_surface_physics = 4 by name -- on the one card class whose
    # standalone frames this tree has read since 2026-08-20.
    #
    # WHAT IT PRICES: the widest unit is noahmp_glacier_composed at 456 B,
    # under the 1,024 B fresh default stack this card reports, so Noah-MP
    # adds 0 B to the launch-time reservation here as well; a scheme-4
    # configuration pays whatever the rest of its kernel set pays.
    #
    # WHAT MOVED: noahmp_driver_composed reads 304 B against the 352 B of
    # both sm_120 / NVRTC 13.x rows and the 288 B of the sm_120 row at
    # this same compiler, and noahmp_leaves (with the two units whose
    # maximum it is) reads 208 B against sm_120's 272 B at this compiler.
    # Architecture and build each move frames, which is why the row is
    # keyed on the pair; a platform with no row is priced from the
    # ceiling over the rows, and the basis says so.  Every unit identity
    # matches the other three rows.
    #
    # CALIBRATION, in the same sitting and on the same card: the three
    # stems that also carry a standalone row on this architecture agree
    # with SM86_NVRTC_13_0_48 to the byte (noahmp_leaves 208, noahmp_snow
    # 200, noahmp_water 224), and the bounded eight-stem pass recorded as
    # SM86_NVRTC_12_9_86 above reproduces every one of that recording's
    # values at this compiler.  That is what says this reading and the
    # standalone census are looking at the same card and the same
    # compiler, with the 13.0.48 -> 12.9.86 step visible in nothing.

    """The NVRTC build one GPU extra of this package installs.

    WHAT SETS THE COMPILE PLATFORM.  A CuPy wheel carries no compiler
    headers, so the ``gpu-cu13`` / ``gpu-cu12`` extras name
    ``cupy-cuda1Nx[ctk]``, whose ``[ctk]`` extra requires
    ``cuda-toolkit[...]==1N.*``, and each cuda-toolkit release pins
    ``nvidia-cuda-nvrtc`` to ONE exact build.  That build -- not the box,
    not the driver, not the card -- is the NVRTC half of the compile
    platform every fresh install compiles on, and it changes the day a
    new cuda-toolkit release lands on the index.  The frames in the
    tables above are readings of (architecture, NVRTC build) pairs, so a
    release whose Noah-MP rows were all read on a build the spec no longer
    resolves to admits Noah-MP on no fresh install at all, while its docs
    say it does.  The first such release was this one, before the 13.4.59
    row: the 13.3.33 reading came from a venv resolved in the 13.3.x
    window (cuda-toolkit 13.3.1), and cuda-toolkit 13.4.1 replaced it on
    the index on 2026-09-09.

    So the resolution is DECLARED here, dated, and gated twice:

    * ``tests/test_kernel_frame_recordings.py`` (no network) asserts that
      ``requirement`` is byte-for-byte the pyproject extra's entry, and
      that every ``current`` pin with ``noahmp_architectures`` has a
      :class:`ComposedUnitFrameRecording` at ``(arch, nvrtc_build)`` for
      each architecture -- so an edit to the extra, or a re-pin here
      without a reading, is a red CPU test rather than a refusal on every
      user's machine;
    * ``tools/measure_noahmp_frames.py resolve`` (network) resolves the
      requirement against the live index with ``pip install --dry-run
      --report`` and compares the ``nvidia-cuda-nvrtc`` version it
      returns with ``nvrtc_build``, so the declaration is re-checked at
      the cut and the day a new cuda-toolkit release moves the compiler
      is the day the table is known to need a row.

    ``current`` is False for a build the spec USED to resolve to: its
    rows still price the installs that resolved in that window, and the
    declaration says which window that was.
