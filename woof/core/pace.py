"""How fast this plan will actually run, said BEFORE it runs.

THE HOLE THIS FILLS.  Every memory figure this package publishes is
careful, itemized and provenanced, and none of them is the number a user
acts on.  A 399,119-column domain on a 10 GiB card is priced correctly,
sent down the streamed road correctly, and started -- and nothing
anywhere says what a streamed step at that size COSTS, so a three-hour
forecast that is going to take hours of wall clock looks, from the
outside, exactly like a stall.  A plan document that answers "will it
fit" and refuses to answer "how long" has answered the easier half of
the question.

NOTHING HERE IS INVENTED.  Every rate is a measurement this repository
already carries, with the card, the grid and the timestep named; where a
figure is a bound rather than a measurement its ``basis`` says
``unmeasured-bound`` in those words, and :attr:`StepRate.measured` is
the field a caller branches on.

THE MEASUREMENTS
----------------
RESIDENT, full physics (Thompson/Morrison + RTE-RRTMGP + YSU + Noah +
Kain-Fritsch), per COLUMN per step at nz=49:

* ``docs/public/receipts/obsbattery/grounding-3km-conus-run-report.json``
  -- 796x636x49 at 3 km, dt 15 s, 1440 steps in 1366.03 s on an RTX 5090
  (Linux, sole occupant confirmed) = 0.9486 s/step = **1.874e-6 s per
  column-step**.
  This is the best-loaded measured run in the fleet and it is the FAST
  end.
* ``docs/public/HARDWARE.md`` -- 438x352x49 at 12 km, dt 60 s, 360 steps
  in 400 s on an RTX 4090 (Linux) = 1.111 s/step = **7.21e-6 s per
  column-step**.  A slower card AND a radiation-heavy cadence (at dt
  60 s a 12-minute ``radt`` fires every 12 steps instead of every 48),
  which is why it is the SLOW end.

STREAMED, full physics, per column per step:

* ``tilestream/HANDOFF-case-imagery.md`` -- a real HRRR case,
  1200x900x49 at 3 km, dt 15 s, tile 400x300 with halo 16 and 2
  buffers, on a single RTX 4090: **11.66 s/step measured**, with 9.6
  s/step on a less contended box and 22.6 s/step with a second forecast
  on the same card.  At 1,080,000 columns that is **8.89e-6 to 2.09e-5 s
  per column-step**.  The same receipt records that the design "moves
  ~27 GB of pinned host RAM per step" and a redundancy of 1.1952x, and
  :func:`streamed_transfer_bytes_per_step` reproduces BOTH from the
  tiling alone -- 27.1 GB and 1.1952x -- which is what licenses using
  that byte model on tilings nobody has timed.

A STREAMED STEP IS NOT ONLY ITS COLUMNS.  The rows above are whole steps
of the tiling they were measured on (1.1952x, nine tiles), per domain
column.  A tiling that does more halo work pays for it column for column,
so the column term is scaled by the plan's redundancy; and every tile
pays its own kernel sequence and sync whatever its size, which a column
rate cannot see at all.  :data:`TILE_SECONDS_LOW`/:data:`TILE_SECONDS_HIGH`
carry that per-tile cost, each end fitted from a streamed forecast of
hundreds of tiles once the column term at the same end is taken out, and
are charged for the tiles past the nine the rows already contain
(:data:`STREAMED_REFERENCE_TILES`).  Without both terms a 1,190-tile
sweep at 49.95x was quoted 0.45-1.2 s per step and ran at 237-547 s
(measured 2026-09-26).

THE THREE EFFECTS THAT MOVE A RATE, all of them measured here:

* **Card.** The identical speedrun grid measured 7.885e-6 s per
  column-step on an RTX 5070 Ti (Linux) and 1.381e-5 on an RTX 3080
  (Windows) -- **1.75x** -- and the 1.5.0 envelope pair measured 7.17e-7
  against 1.231e-6, **1.72x**, independently.  :data:`CARD_SPREAD`
  carries it, and it already contains the Windows/WDDM platform gap
  because the slow member of each pair is the Windows box.
* **Radiation cadence.** Radiation is 69% of a reference step (486 ms of
  it, ``docs/lead-handoff-2026-07-26.md``), and it fires on a wall-clock
  period, so a longer ``dt`` amortizes it over fewer steps and every
  step costs more.  The bracket spans two measured cadences rather than
  modelling this.
* **Launch-bound floor.** Below roughly 100,000 columns the card is not
  loaded and the per-column rate degrades sharply -- measured 1.11e-5 at
  250x200 against 1.874e-6 at 796x636 on the same card class
  (``docs/da-vs-wofs.md``: "small enough to be launch-bound").
  :data:`LAUNCH_BOUND_COLUMNS` is where the sentence says so.

Session-to-session variance on one box is up to 30% (stated in
``docs/public/HARDWARE.md`` and twice more), which is a further reason
every figure here is a bracket and none is presented as exact.

THE COLUMN BOUND.  :func:`resident_column_limit` is the largest column
count whose whole peak -- the domain, the per-process fixed cost, the
CUDA context and the rung's measured RRTMGP transient reservation --
still fits the card's allowance.  It is inverted from
``tilestream.autoplan``'s own cost model and checked against
``autoplan.plan`` at the boundary in the tests, because a report that
advised a size the planner then streamed anyway would be two models of
one card.  It is the actionable number: the memory report says the
current domain does not fit, and this says which one would be fast.

#:
#: BOTH ENDS ARE FITTED NET OF THIS MODULE'S OWN COLUMN TERM: a measured
#: step, less the redundancy-scaled column term at the same end of the
#: bracket, over the tiles past the rows' nine.  A per-tile figure fitted
#: beside some other column term cannot be added to this one, because
#: part of every tile's work is then charged twice.
#: ``tilestream/bench_tile_overhead.py`` fits 18.0 ms a tile beside its own

#: column at its fast end, and the 18 ms added to that prices the LOW
#: forecast below at 17 s a step against the 11.1 s it ran at.
#:
#: * LOW, 0.008 s -- a 208x204x49 3 km forecast (Morrison, YSU, Noah,
#:   RTE+RRTMGP, no cumulus, dt 15 s, radiation every 12 min) streamed in
#:   598 tiles of 8x9 with halo 18 (27.90x redundancy, one buffer, pinned
#:   host store) on an idle RTX 5070 Ti under Linux settled at 11.12 s a
#:   step: the median of 102 steps, 11.08 s the fastest and 11.44 s the
#:   mean with its radiation steps.  The fast-end column term of that
#:   tiling is 5.95 s, so 5.17 s over the 589 tiles past the rows' nine is
#:   8.8 ms a tile.  The constant is that rounded down, so the fastest
#:   settled step lies inside the bracket with room for a second idle run.
#: * HIGH, 0.170 s -- a run measured 2026-09-26: a 206x204x49 domain
#:   swept in 1,190 tiles of 6x6 with halo 18 (49.95x redundancy, one
#:   buffer) on an RTX 3080 under Windows/WDDM that other programs were
#:   drawing on, settled at 237.4 s per 15 s step (296.0 s the step
#:   before).  The slow-end column term of that tiling is 36.7 s, so
#:   200.7 s over the 1,181 tiles past the rows' nine is the per-tile
#:   cost.  A profile of that run put 81% of its wall time in the scheme
#:   status readbacks each tile's physics makes
#:   (:func:`woof.core.health_ledger.read_status` with no ledger
#:   installed): each one waits for the card, and on a WDDM card another
#:   program is drawing on that wait is long, so this end belongs to that
#:   platform and not to a Linux card.
#:
#: HOW THE ENDS ARE CHECKED.  Each end is fitted from one run, so quoting
#: that run back checks the arithmetic and not the model.  The checks that
#: can fail are runs that took no part in either fit, pinned in
#: ``tests/test_streamed_auto_tiling.py``: on the same domain at other
