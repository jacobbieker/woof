# woof/core/moist_n2_mutation.py
"""The moist-N2 mutation control: the saturated branch, forced off.

**This is instrument qualification, not a physics option.**  The LES
completion program spec §3.3 requires it in those words:

    a scratch build with the saturated BN2 switch forced to the dry branch
    (``woof/core/kernels/smag2d.cu``) must move the committed cloud-layer
    metrics; if it does not, **the instrument is rejected, not the engine
    passed**

and the oracle side's hand-off names the metrics it must move:
``cloud_frac``, ``n2_moist_frac`` and the cloud-layer metrics
(``docs/superpowers/receipts/les/wrf-moist-oracle-2026-08-04.md``).

An instrument that cannot fail cannot pass anything.  A moist verdict
built on an instrument that has never been shown to notice condensation is
a verdict about nothing, and this is how it gets shown.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHY A BUILD VARIANT AND NOT A CONFIG KNOB OR AN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nothing in ``RunConfig`` may select broken physics: the config surface is
what a forecast is described by, and a mutation reachable from it is a
mutation that can be reached by accident.  Nor an environment variable --
**no environment variable in woof alters physics**, and the two that come
closest (``WOOF_NOAHMP_HOST_LEAVES``, ``WOOF_NOAHMP_STAGED_COLUMNS``)
select an execution route claimed bit-identical, not a different answer.

The established shape for an opt-in build-level mutation is the one
``woof/core/noahmp_vegeflux_gpu.py`` uses for its ``-DUSE_DEVICE_LIBM``
negative control: an explicit, defaulted-off Python switch; a ``#ifdef``
guard in the ``.cu``; a cache key that includes the variant; and a
kernel-manifest entry of its own.  This module is that shape, expressed
through the loader hook that already exists for it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE CACHE TRAP THIS MODULE EXISTS TO AVOID
------------------------------------------------------------------------
``woof.core.kernels.load_module`` is ``lru_cache``d **on the module name
alone**, and ``get_kernel`` on ``(name, func)``.  Compiling a second
variant of ``smag2d.cu`` through them would silently hand back the FIRST,
UNMUTATED module -- a control arm that quietly runs the production kernel
and "proves" the mutation does nothing.  That failure is invisible in the
output, and it would falsify the instrument in the safe-looking direction.

So the mutant goes through ``get_kernel_int_defines``, whose cache key is
``(name, func, defines)``, and whose manifest key carries the define tier.
The two builds are therefore two entries, two compiled images, and two
cache slots, and neither can be served in place of the other.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT THE MUTATION DOES NOT TOUCH, DELIBERATELY
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The engagement diagnostic (``n2_moist_frac``, ``sat_frac``,
``cloud_frac``) is a HOST-side re-evaluation of WRF's predicate over the
state, not a readback of the branch the kernel took.  It is not mutated
and must not be: under the mutation it keeps reporting, accurately, what the
state the mutant produced looks like.  So the mutation moves those numbers
only through the trajectory -- a suppressed saturated branch gives a
different BN2, hence different K, hence different mixing, hence a
different cloud field -- which is exactly the causal chain the control is
supposed to exercise.  A mutation that moved the diagnostic directly would
prove only that the diagnostic reads its own switch.
