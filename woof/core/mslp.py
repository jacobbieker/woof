"""Sea-level pressure reduction, and the smoother its consumers share.

They live here, in a stdlib-plus-numpy module, because of where they
have to be readable from.  Their historical home is
``woof.verify.metrics``, and ``woof/verify`` is a DEVELOPER
verification tree that the standalone CPU preprocessing distribution
deliberately omits -- so a core-layer import of it breaks that wheel
(``tests/test_native_wrf_distribution.py`` is the gate that says so, and
it caught exactly that: ``woof.core.storm_tracking`` reduces sea-level
pressure to find a vortex centre, and reached across the boundary for
the transcription rather than restating it).

Same shape as ``sase_limits.py``: the values and the arithmetic move,
nothing is duplicated.  ``woof.verify.metrics`` imports them back from
here, so its own API -- and the identity every case module and gate
binds to -- is unchanged.
