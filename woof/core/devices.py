"""``[devices]``: one forecast split across several cards.

THE SURFACE
-----------
::

    [devices]
    count = 2              # slabs (ranks) the domain is split into
    # grid = "1x2"         # GYxGX; default: the split with the shortest seams
    # ids = [0, 1]         # the card each rank runs on; default 0 .. count-1
    # transport = "auto"   # how halos cross between cards
    # domains = [1, 2]     # a nested tree: which grids are split; default all

``domains`` (a nested tree only) names the grids that run split, each with
the same ``count``/``grid``/``ids``; a grid left out runs resident on the
first card of ``ids``.  Absent, every grid of the tree is split.  The
parent's forcing reaches a split nest through the nest coupler's rolling
tables, windowed per slab, and a split parent serves its nest's FORCE and
takes its feedback through the parent's host store.

``count = 1`` (the default, and what an experiment that never mentions the
table carries) is the one-card run, unchanged: no builder, no wrapper, no
import of the rank machinery.  ``count > 1`` runs the domain as ``count``
permanently resident slabs, each on its own card, stepping at the same time
and swapping a wide halo once per model step (``tilestream.ranks``).

``ids`` may repeat a card.  ``count = 2, ids = [0, 0]`` puts both slabs on
card 0.  That buys no speed and is not meant to: it is the configuration the
bit-exactness proof runs on a one-card machine, because it exercises every
line of the split (the plan, the per-slab build, the seam exchange, the
shared clock, the joined output) except the physical link between two cards.

``transport``
    ``"auto"``   peer-to-peer copies between two cards when the driver says
                 both directions can reach each other
                 (``cudaDeviceCanAccessPeer``), CUDA's own host staging of
                 the same peer copy otherwise.  Decided at run time, per
                 ordered pair of cards, and written in the receipt.
    ``"peer"``   the peer copy, and the run is refused when some pair cannot
                 reach each other directly (a benchmark that must measure the
                 direct path).
    ``"staged"`` the peer-copy call with peer access left off, so CUDA stages
                 it through host memory (the GeForce path, measured faster
                 than hand-rolled staging on 2x RTX 4090).
    ``"host"``   explicit pinned-host staging, device to host then host to
                 device, in two copies.
    Two slabs on the SAME card always use a plain device-to-device copy.

WHAT IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE RESTART IDENTITY: NOTHING
----------------------------------------------------
Same law as ``[tiles]`` (:func:`woof.core.streaming.identity_payload_entry`):
the split is an execution choice whose whole claim is that it changes no
byte, so a checkpoint written on two cards must resume on one and back again.
