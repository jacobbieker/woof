"""Storm tracking for the storm-following moving nest: the WHEN and WHERE.

:mod:`woof.core.nest_relocation` is the mechanism half of a moving nest
and says so in its own docstring: *"it does not decide when or where to
move -- there is no tracker, no scoring, no hysteresis here.  Placement is
an input."*  This module is that missing half.  It watches the RUNNING
MODEL'S OWN FIELDS on the parent domain and turns them into discrete
whole-parent-cell shift proposals a relocation runner can hand to
:func:`woof.core.nest_relocation.relocate_child`.

THE SEAM (the plan-provider contract).  The runner side of the moving-nest
program consumes a tracker through one callable, evaluated once per
relocation cadence (a cycle boundary, never mid-step)::

    desired_shift(parent_state, nest_footprint, t) -> (di, dj) | None

``parent_state`` is the PARENT domain's live state (host or device);
``nest_footprint`` is where the child currently sits, as a
:class:`NestFootprint` or anything carrying the five
:class:`woof.experiment.DomainConfig` placement/extent attributes;
``t`` is model seconds since the experiment start (model time, not
wallclock, so the hysteresis is deterministic and restart-independent).
The return is the desired move in WHOLE PARENT CELLS -- ``di`` along the
x/i axis (the LAST array axis; positive means a larger ``i_parent_start``)
and ``dj`` along y/j (axis -2, positive means larger ``j_parent_start``)
-- or ``None`` for "hold".  The runner applies it as
``i_parent_start + di`` / ``j_parent_start + dj`` and the leg-1
admissibility bounds (:func:`woof.core.nest_relocation.check_admissible`)
remain the runner's to enforce; a tracker proposes, it never moves
anything.  :class:`StormTracker` implements the contract and ``__call__``
aliases it, so the provider is literally "a callable returning the desired
whole-parent-cell shift each cadence".  One optional duck-typed hook
completes the seam: the runner calls
:meth:`StormTracker.notify_move_executed` with the shift it really
applied after each successful relocation, and from then on the cooldown
counts from EXECUTED moves; a runner that never calls it leaves the
proposal-burn fallback in force.

WHAT IT TRACKS.  Primary signal: a column updraft-helicity running-max
plane, folded every step by :mod:`woof.core.uh_diag` from WRF's own
cal_helicity columns.  It is THIS CONSUMER'S window
(``uh_diag.UH_FOLLOW_WINDOW_SLOT``), reset by the relocation runner at
every evaluation, so it is exactly "the strongest rotation since the
tracker last had a chance to move".

It is deliberately NOT WRF's UP_HELI_MAX diagnostic, which is folded from
the same columns in the same pass but zeroed by the HISTORY WRITER.
Reading that one made a nest's placement a function of
``history_interval_s``: an output knob silently steering the model
(closed 2026-08-07).  The window is a max over the interval rather than
an instantaneous sample because UH is spiky -- sampling it at cadence
boundaries would alias transient mesocyclone pulses, and a threshold
cannot un-alias a signal.

A rotating storm is what a tornado nest exists to follow, so rotation is
the primary vote.  Fallback:
the column-max (composite) simulated reflectivity from the persistent
``refl_10cm`` slot, for the window before the storm rotates -- an echo
centroid keeps the nest on the convection until a mesocyclone exists to
take over.  The centroid arithmetic is the WaH survey's proven idiom
(``echo_stats`` / ``motion_from_centroids`` in tools/da_nowcast.py):
threshold, then a weighted centroid of the exceedance -- adapted here to
grid index space rather than radar gate space, and kept in core so the
model never imports from tools.

WHY HYSTERESIS.  A centroid jitters: convective cells pulse, split and
merge, and a nest that re-centers on every wobble spends its life paying
relocation spin-up strips for moves that bought nothing.  Three guards,
all configured, all logged when they fire:

- dead-band: a proposed shift below ``min_shift_cells`` (Chebyshev norm)
  is suppressed -- the storm has not really left the middle of the nest;
- clamp: a shift is limited to ``max_shift_cells`` per axis per event, so
  one bad centroid (or one real jump) cannot trade away most of the
  overlap transplant in a single move;
- cooldown: after a proposal, further proposals are suppressed for
  ``cooldown_seconds`` of model time, so the donor tables are not rebuilt
  every cadence while a storm crosses cells at speed.

Every call appends a receipt carrying the centroid evidence and the
decision, so a run's move/hold history is auditable after the fact.

CONFIG.  ``[relocation.follow]`` under the leg-1 ``[relocation]`` table
(:func:`woof.experiment._build_relocation` wires it): ``field``
(``"uh"`` | ``"reflectivity"`` | ``"pressure"``), ``threshold`` (m2 s-2
for uh, dBZ for reflectivity, and under ``"pressure"`` either metres of
geopotential height above the search box's minimum or an absolute hPa
sea-level ceiling -- which one is decided by ``level_hpa``),
``fallback_threshold`` (dBZ; required with ``field = "uh"``, refused
otherwise -- a m2 s-2 number cannot be reused as a dBZ one),
``search_margin_cells``, ``min_shift_cells``, ``max_shift_cells``,
``cooldown_seconds``.  Optional: ``level_hpa``, ``radius_km``,
``refine_grid_id``.  Unknown keys refuse, and the constructed config
echoes its values (:meth:`FollowConfig.to_json`).

WHICH SURFACE, since it is the one default that decides what the
threshold MEANS.  Under ``field = "pressure"`` an absent ``level_hpa``
is ``DEFAULT_LEVEL_HPA`` (850 hPa), the low-level circulation centre a
nest should be centred on.  ``level_hpa = 0`` (``SEA_LEVEL_HPA``) is the
sea-level-pressure tracker, and is the only form whose threshold is an
absolute hPa ceiling.  The two threshold bands are disjoint by
construction, so a config that means one and is read as the other
refuses at load rather than tracking the wrong thing.

#: ``level_hpa = 0`` is the sea-level reduction (see SEA_LEVEL_HPA).
#:
#: The measured reason to prefer it over the sea-level default it

#: the nest, and its threshold is an absolute ceiling that can match every

#: ("which surface?") with the one answer that is not an isobaric
#: surface.  Zero can never collide with a real choice: the admissible

SEA_LEVEL_HPA = 0.0

#: How many isobaric surfaces may be named.  THERE IS NO LIMIT, and the

#: is true of STEERING and was never true of REPORTING -- a vertical
#: profile of where the vortex sits is exactly what more surfaces buy.
#:
#: What made the cap defensible was an unmeasured fear of the cost.
#: Measured, on this card at 49x378x378: one surface is 2.28 ms and the
#: scaling is FLAT -- 3 surfaces 8.0 ms, 8 surfaces 20.6 ms, 20 surfaces
#: 45 ms, 37 surfaces 101 ms, all within noise of 2.3 ms each.  Against
#: the relocation cadence a moving nest actually runs (360 s), a 3-day
#: forecast consults 720 times: 20 surfaces is 32 seconds, or 0.15% of
#: the run.  A limit that costs a user their vertical profile to save
#: 0.15% is not a limit worth having.
#:
#: Each surface still has to be INSIDE the column (LEVEL_HPA_MIN..MAX,

#: CLIPPED BY THE DOMAIN EDGE on most frames -- so the centroid was
#: partly an average of where the grid stops, which makes the nest's own
#: position an input to the centre it computes.  The default is a real

#:
#: 50 km measured 1.05 km from the field minimum against 10.68 km for

    Stage two of the tracker.  Stage one finds the storm on the mover's
    PARENT, which is the only field that can see outside the nest -- and
    on a 13.5 km parent that is a coarse answer for a nest whose whole
    purpose is 1.125 km.  MEASURED on Melissa (2025-10-22 01:12): d01's
    850 hPa minimum sat 44.9 km from d03's own, d02's sat 54.0 km from
    it, and the tracker's centroid 57.5 km -- so the nest was centred, to
    the tracker's satisfaction, on a point 50-odd km from the vortex the
    1.125 km grid actually resolved.  In a 338 km frame that is 16% off

    is.  This carries that domain's state plus the affine map from its
    own 0-based cell index back to the mover's parent coordinate, which
    is the space every shift in this module is expressed in.

    The map composes :class:`NestFootprint`'s own convention up the
    chain: a child mass cell ``m`` (0-based) sits at parent coordinate
    ``(i_parent_start - 1) + m / ratio``, so for d03 inside d02 inside
    d01 the composition collapses to ``origin + m/12`` with
    ``origin = (d02.i_parent_start - 1) + (d03.i_parent_start - 1)/3``.

    """Smoothed geopotential height (m) on the ``level_hpa`` isobaric
    surface, as a host ``(ny, nx)`` plane.

    THE MID-LEVEL VORTEX, WHICH IS WHAT WRF TRACKS.  WRF's moving nest
    does not follow sea-level pressure: ``&domains track_level`` (Pa,
    default 50000) names an isobaric surface and the vortex is the
    height minimum on it.  This is that surface, chosen in hPa because
    every other pressure in this config surface is.

    WHY IT BEATS MSLP for a nest to ride.  Sea-level pressure is a
    REDUCTION -- below ground it is an extrapolation through a fictitious
    column, so an island in the footprint injects a terrain signal into
    the very field steering the nest, and the reduction's own smoothing
    is what keeps that tolerable.  A geopotential height on an isobaric
    surface above the boundary layer is a measured quantity everywhere
    that surface exists: no reduction, no fictitious column, no terrain
    term.  It is also where the vortex is most coherent -- the low-level
    centre wobbles with convection on a 5-15 km scale, and that wobble is
    exactly the jitter that made the reflectivity tracker walk a nest
    east and then back (see the 2026-08-12 measurement).

    WHERE THE SURFACE DOES NOT EXIST the cells do not vote.  A column
    whose surface pressure is below ``level_hpa`` has that surface
    underground; a column whose top is above it has it out of the domain.
    Both are NaN here and both are dropped by
    :func:`weighted_centroid`'s finiteness mask, rather than being
    extrapolated into a height that would out-vote the real centre.

    OPTIMISED, and deliberately: this runs on the DEVICE, on the two
    fields it needs (``p`` and the geopotential pair), and only the
    finished ``(ny, nx)`` plane crosses to the host.  The MSLP path pulls
    five FULL 3-D fields across and reduces them in host numpy --- for a
    372x284x45 parent that is ~190 MiB per tracker call against ~0.4 MiB
    here.  The reduction itself is one ``count_nonzero`` plus four
    ``take_along_axis`` gathers and a lerp: no per-column search loop,
    no Python over grid points.

    Log-linear in pressure, which is the standard isobaric interpolation
    and is exact for an isothermal layer (hydrostatic + ideal gas make
    ``z`` linear in ``ln p``); over a WRF layer thickness the residual is
    far below the metres this tracker resolves.

    ``window`` is an optional ``(j_slice, i_slice)`` -- the shape
    :meth:`NestFootprint.search_box` returns -- and it is the reason this
    function is affordable to call more than once a relocation cadence.
    The full-domain reduction pulls FOUR 3-D fields to the host and runs
    DCOMPUTESEAPRS over all of them in host float64: MEASURED at 240 ms
    on a 378x378x49 grid (RTX 5070 Ti), of which 211 ms is host
    arithmetic and 25 ms is the copy.  Cropping to the box the caller
    actually searches costs 26 ms for a 120x120 window on that grid, and
    :func:`_halo_crop` explains why the answer is bitwise the same.

    Outside the window the returned plane is NaN, so a windowed plane is
    shape-compatible with a full one and no consumer can accidentally
    read a value that was never computed.

    THE VORTEX SIGNAL, AND WHY IT IS NOT A STASH.  ``uh`` and
    ``reflectivity`` are planes somebody else folded and left in a
    scratch slot, which is why their cadence is chained to the history
    writer.  Sea-level pressure is not stored anywhere: it is REDUCED
    here from the live prognostic column, which is valid at every cycle
    boundary.  A pressure tracker therefore has no cadence contract with
    the output knobs at all -- see :data:`STASH_BACKED_FIELDS`.

    THE REDUCTION IS NOT A NEW ONE.  It is
    ``woof.core.mslp._dcomputeseaprs`` -- the wrf-python
    DCOMPUTESEAPRS (Shuell 1995) transcription this tree already
    validated against the wrf-rust oracle to 4.6e-10 hPa -- fed the
    same four fields its wrfout caller feeds it, derived from state
    rather than read from a file:

    ============  ==================  =============================
    wrfout        this state          note
    ============  ==================  =============================
    ``P + PB``    ``state.p``         EOS pressure (Pa)
    ``T + 300``   ``total_theta()``   potential temperature (K)
    ``QVAPOR``    ``state.qv``        zero on a dry state
    ``PH + PHB``  ``php + phb``       geopotential; /9.80665 for z
    ============  ==================  =============================

    The temperature closure and the 9.80665 height divisor are copied
    from that caller verbatim (``woof/verify/metrics.py:195-215``) so
    the tracker and the verification maps cannot drift apart.

    SMOOTHED BEFORE IT IS SEARCHED, which is the substantive half of
    WRF's vortex finder.  A raw grid-scale pressure dimple can outrank
    the real centre; three passes of the Shuman nine-point smoother
    attenuate a checkerboard by 1/27 per interior cell and leave the
    synoptic minimum where it was.  Same parameters the MSLP display

    * a threshold alone selects whatever it selects -- on a 243 km nest
      whose whole 850 hPa height field spans 41-49 m, a 30 m threshold
      took 44-65% of the grid, CLIPPED BY THE DOMAIN EDGE.  The centroid
      was then partly an average of where the grid stops, which makes
      the nest's own placement an input to the centre steering it;
    * bounding it to a disc fixes that, but a disc has to be anchored,
      and the obvious anchor -- the extremum cell -- is itself unstable:
      the bare minimum jumps 5.94 km per 3-minute frame, max 17.83 km,
      because mesovortices and a broad centre move it around.

    Iterating ``c <- centroid of the deficit within radius of c`` to a
    fixed point removes the anchor from the answer.  MEASURED: started
    from ten points scattered across the whole domain, every frame
    converges (16-31 iterations) to ONE basin, with the ten answers
    within 12-88 METRES of each other.  So the flickering extremum stops
    mattering -- it is a seed, not a determinant.

    Jitter, same 21 frames: 5.94 km for the bare extremum, 5.74 km for a
    disc anchored on it, **4.96 km** for the fixed point.

    WHEN IT DOES NOT CONVERGE TO ONE POINT the field genuinely has more
    than one centre, and that is reported rather than averaged away
    (``competing_centre``).  A centroid of two lows sits between them,
    on neither.

    ``radius_cells`` ``None`` restores the unbounded single pass and
    exists for callers with no grid spacing to convert with; it is not
    reachable from config.

    :func:`signal_span` answers whether the threshold can discriminate at

    same: a search box with a large span has a minimum, but a minimum is
    not a vortex.  Over open ocean under a synoptic gradient the box
    spans hundreds of metres, the threshold discriminates perfectly, and
    the cells within ``threshold`` of the box minimum are a STRIP ALONG
    THE BOX EDGE -- the lowest corner of a slope the box happened to cut.
    The fixed point settles in that strip because the box stopped it
    there, so the shift it implies is the distance from the nest to the
    box's own corner, proposed on no storm.

    :func:`weighted_centroid` names this failure itself: a centroid over
    a region the domain edge clipped "was then partly an average of where
    the grid stops, which makes the nest's own placement an input to the
    centre steering it".  So the criterion is that sentence, tested:

        closed  <=>  none of the cells that PRODUCED the centre lie on a
                     box edge the plane continues past

    The cells that produced the centre are the qualifying cells within
    ``radius_cells`` of it, which is the disc :func:`weighted_centroid`
    draws its answer from; with no radius configured it reduces to the
    single unbounded pass over the whole box, and so does this test.
    There is no tuning constant in either form -- the radius is the
    configured ``radius_km``, and a box side that coincides with the
    plane's own edge is not counted at all, because that is the signal
    leaving the grid rather than a window cut out of a larger field, and
    :func:`woof.core.track_boundary.boundary_reason` and a refine grid's
    ``edge_margin_cells`` already say so in their own words.

    2.41 to 3.13 cells from an open box edge, every instant; on a
    978.7 hPa cyclone the same tracker sat 25.14 to 39.54 cells from one,
