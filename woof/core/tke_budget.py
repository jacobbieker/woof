"""Term-by-term prognostic-TKE budget, accumulated on device per step.

WP-L7 window preparation for the LES program (AC-L5.1): the volume-
integrated ``de/dt`` compared against the terms that produced it, with the
residual COMMITTED as a receipt rather than scored against a bound cut from
itself.  Nothing here gates; nothing here is a band.

What is measured
----------------
Every term is a COUPLED tendency -- the same ``(c1*mu + c2) * e`` currency
the RK scalar update consumes -- summed over each horizontal slab in FP64 by
one device launch per model step.  The terms partition the completed step
exactly:

``shear``, ``buoyancy``, ``dissipation``, ``limiter``
    the four pieces ``wrf_tke_rhs`` deposits (module_diffusion_em.F
    tke_rhs :6099-6229); ``limiter`` is what the positivity floor at :6221
    added on top of the physical source, exported instead of folded into
    ``dissipation`` so a floor-dominated regime is legible as one.
``diffusion_h``, ``diffusion_v``
    TKE self-diffusion with 2*Km, horizontal and vertical
    (:3988-3996 / :4896-4904).
``diffusion_6th``
    the sixth-order filter row, present only under ``diff_6th_opt > 0``
    with ``tke_mix6_off`` false.
``transport``
    the final RK stage's advective flux divergence (WRF ``rk_scalar_tend``
    for tke, solve_em.F:2362-2399).
``storage``
    ``(chm*e_new - chm0*e_old)/dt`` for the completed step.
``clip``
    what ``bound_tke`` (module_em.F:2490-2520) and the PD zero clamp moved
    at the final update.  Non-conservative by construction and therefore
    never absorbed into the residual.

``residual = storage - sum(all other terms)`` is then a pure discretization
/ FP32-rounding measure of the port, which is exactly the number AC-L5.1
asks to be committed.  The accompanying sensitivity claim -- dropping
dissipation from the trajectory moves the budget by orders of magnitude --
is the bound-free control, and it lives in tests/test_tke_km2.py.

Ownership
---------
The accumulator lives in ``DomainState._scratch`` under the ``tke_budget_``
slot family (restart class REBUILT: a report-only per-window accumulator the
caller drains, never trajectory state).  No new ``DomainState`` attribute,
no new restart-serialized field.  ``cfg.tke_budget`` is a restart-boundary-
adjustable diagnostic toggle exactly like ``nwp_diagnostics``.
