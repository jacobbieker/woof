"""Runtime ownership for the aerosol-aware Thompson coefficient tables.

:mod:`woof.core.thompson_aerosol_contract` proves the bytes on disk and
derives the gamma moments.  This module closes the second half of that
boundary for ``mp_physics=28``: it uploads every array without a precision or
layout conversion, verifies a device round trip, and retains one process-local
owner per CUDA device.

It is deliberately a sibling of :mod:`woof.core.thompson_runtime` rather than
an extension of it.  The classic uploader owns four assets totalling 380 MB
whose SHA-256 pins identify the WRF coefficient bytes used by mp=8. This
table contract is separate from historical matched-run evidence. An mp=28
adapter loads both owners from the same root, so ``tnccn_act`` and its tables can
never come from different WRF builds.

The one asset uploaded here, ``CCN_ACTIVATE.BIN``, **ships with woof** as
WRF v4.6.1's own ``run/`` file; it is still located per
:func:`~woof.core.thompson_aerosol_contract.resolve_ccn_activation_path`, so
an override can bind the run to another copy, and its absence -- or a
byte-different table at any of those locations -- is fatal, never defaulted.
``tnc_wev``, by contrast, needs no new asset at all and is not uploaded here:
see :func:`device_drop_evaporation_number_table`.

Merely importing this module does not make ``mp_physics=28`` selectable.
