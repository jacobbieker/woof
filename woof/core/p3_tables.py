"""P3 (``mp_physics=50``) lookup-table packaging, loading, and generation.

Transcription authority: byte-frozen WRF v4.6.1
``phys/module_mp_p3.F`` (P3 v4.5.2), subroutine ``p3_init`` lines 112-685.
``p3_init`` does three table jobs for the 1-category / 2-moment-ice
configuration this port ships:

1. READ the main ice lookup table file
   ``p3_lookupTable_1.dat-v5.4_2momI`` (:337-410): a version-checked header
   (:351-366) followed by, for each (density jj=1..5, rime-fraction
   ii=1..4) block, 50 lines of 3 index tokens + 14 ``itab`` process
   quantities (:371-384) and then 50x30 lines of 3 index tokens + 2
   double-precision ice-rain collection quantities stored into the
   single-precision ``itabcoll`` (:387-396).  The byte-identical file from
   the reference bundle's ``run/`` directory is committed under
   ``woof/data/p3/tables`` and SHA-256-validated before parsing, the same
   packaging pattern as Thompson's classic tables.

2. GENERATE the rain fallspeed / ventilation tables ``vn_table``,
   ``vm_table``, ``revap_table`` (300 x 10) by numerically integrating the
   rain PSD over 10 000 size bins (:599-670), and fill ``mu_r_table`` with
   the constant ``mu_r_constant = 0`` (:596; the variable-``mu_r``
   iteration is commented out in the authority).  The generation here is
   float32 throughout with the Fortran's per-bin sequential accumulation
   order preserved (a NumPy ``sum`` would use pairwise reduction and
   change the roundoff); the ``mu_r`` loop columns are all computed with
   ``mu_r = mu_r_constant`` in the authority (:610), so the 10 columns are
   identical by construction and are computed once and broadcast.

3. The multi-category table 2 and the 3-moment table-1 variant are NOT
   packaged: they belong to the unported ``mp_physics=52`` / ``53``
   options, which woof refuses by name (woof/config.py).

MEASURED against running Fortran, 2026-08-28 (a development machine, gfortran 15.2.0,
WRF's own ``module_mp_p3.F`` compiled unmodified except for an appended
dump routine, ``p3_init(nCat=1, trplMomI=.false., model='WRF')``):

* ``itab`` (14,000 float32) and ``itabcoll`` (60,000 float32) parsed by
  :func:`load_lookup_table_1` are BYTE-IDENTICAL to the module variables
  ``p3_init`` fills -- ``tobytes()`` equality, zero differing words, at
  both -O0 and -O2.  The double-rounding risk the paragraph below names
  is therefore not realised on this table; the digests are pinned as
  :data:`FORTRAN_ITAB_SHA256` / :data:`FORTRAN_ITABCOLL_SHA256`.
* :func:`generate_rain_tables` is NOT byte-identical: ``vn_table`` differs
  in 1,150 of 3,000 entries (max 5 ULP, max relative 3.3e-07),
  ``vm_table`` in 940 (max 4 ULP, 4.2e-07) and ``revap_table`` in 110
  (max 21 ULP, 2.2e-06).  Root cause MEASURED, not inferred: the
  transcription's structure and accumulation order are right (``lamr`` is
  byte-identical), and the divergence is host libm.  Over the loop's own
  10,000 arguments, numpy's float32 ``exp`` differs from glibc ``expf``
  on 5,824 of them by up to 3 ULP, and ``10.**(3*log10(dia))`` differs on
  705 by up to 36 ULP -- the latter being a 1-ULP ``log10`` difference
  amplified by ``ln(10)`` times an exponent of magnitude ~18.  A
  byte-identical rain table needs a correctly-rounded libm on this path
  (woof.core.correctly_rounded_libm) or the generated tables shipped as
  data; neither is decided here, and the divergence is DECLARED rather
  than tolerated by a loosened comparison.

Precision note (documented, not a divergence by design): the Fortran
list-directed READ converts the decimal text directly to REAL(4);
this loader parses to float64 and casts, which can in principle
double-round the last ULP of a value whose decimal representation falls
within half a float32 ULP of a rounding boundary.  The committed table
carries 5 significant digits, far from any such boundary -- and the
measurement above confirms it: every one of the 74,000 parsed values
matches the Fortran bit for bit.
