"""Discrete relocation of a child domain to a new parent-cell placement.

WHAT THIS IS.  A moving nest here is **a sequence of static nests joined by
a re-grid at cycle boundaries** -- not WRF's per-step continuous motion.
The distinction is the whole design.  WRF's mechanism moves the child by
one parent cell inside the integration and therefore invalidates the SINT
donor index/weight tables constantly; this module moves the child at a
cycle boundary, rebuilds the tables **once per placement generation**, and
leaves the per-step numerics exactly as they were.  That is why the
namelist keys guarding the per-step mechanism stay rejected
(``woof.experiment._MOVING_NEST_KEYS``) while this path is admissible:
the premise those keys protect -- "the donor tables are precomputed once at
setup" -- is preserved, with "setup" reading "per placement generation".

THE ARITHMETIC THAT MAKES IT EXACT.  A placement is a whole number of
PARENT cells, so a move of ``di`` parent cells is a move of ``di * ratio``
child cells: an exact shift in child index space.  Write the WRF donor
pickup (``interp_fcn.F:975-985``) for child index ``n`` under placement
``p``::

    ci = p + (n-1)/ratio        ip = mod(n-1, ratio)

For the new placement ``p1`` and child index ``n'``, the cell covering the
same ground under the old placement ``p0`` is ``n = n' + (p1-p0)*ratio``,
and substituting gives ``ci`` and ``ip`` **identical** in both.  Two
consequences follow, and both are essential:

1. the overlap transplant is a pure index-space copy -- no interpolation,
   no resampling, no loss; and
2. anything the child derives from its parent by SINT (its base state, its
   terrain) is *bitwise identical* on the overlap before and after the
   move, because it is the same donor cell with the same sub-cell offset.

Property (2) is checked at every relocation (:func:`donor_alignment_check`)
and is an independent instrument: it is computed by the SINT operator, not
by the shift arithmetic this module implements, so a wrong shift cannot
make it pass.

WHAT MOVES AND WHAT DOES NOT.  The parent is read and never written --
:func:`parent_only_init` fills the child out-of-place, so the relocation
inherits the coupler's registered non-mutating property unchanged.  On the
child, the newly covered strip is filled by the ordinary cold-start path
(a full SINT of the live parent) and the overlap is then stamped bitwise
from the outgoing child, so the child keeps every fine-scale structure it
had integrated over ground it still covers.  The seam between strip and
overlap is real and is what the placement policy's "lead the storm, do not
chase it" bias exists to keep out of the way; it is reported as
``spin_up_cells`` rather than hidden.

WHAT THIS MODULE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO.  It does not decide *when* or
*where* to move -- there is no tracker, no scoring, no hysteresis here.
Placement is an input.

WHAT A RESTART ACROSS A MOVE PROMISES: THE RUN THAT WROTE IT, BIT FOR
BIT.  It promised NOTHING under the 2026-08-06 ruling -- *"a restart
across a move promises nothing imo its a pure efficiency experiment"* --
and that was a true statement about the machinery as it then stood,
which carried none of the three things a resume needs across a
checkpoint: the placement and the tracker's hysteresis, the acoustic
Omega, and the tracker's consultation window.  All three are carried
now, the resume reproduces the unbroken run bit for bit, and the posture
moved with them.  :data:`RESTART_ACROSS_MOVE_POSTURE` below is the
current wording and is the only text in this module allowed to state it.

Moving nests still exist so that a low-VRAM card can run a smaller nest
that FOLLOWS the weather at a resolution a static nest of the same cost
could never reach; a resume is a second thing they can now do, not the
reason they exist.  WHAT DID NOT CHANGE IS THE IDENTITY.  The
prepared-cache key and the tree restart fingerprint still bind the
placement, a move still invalidates both against a FRESH build, and a
moved checkpoint resumes only by replaying its own chain of move digests
back into that fingerprint -- so the gate keeps its full meaning and
merely stops being unpassable for the run that wrote it.

Determinism WITHIN a placement is unaffected and still holds -- not
because anything here protects it, but because nothing here touches the
machinery that provides it.  :class:`Placement` and
:class:`RelocationSegment` still record what happened for receipts and
diagnostics, but the record digests they carry are what the resume
replays, so a lenient reader of one is a correctness defect and not a
cosmetic one.  See ``docs/nest-relocation-identity-decision.md``.

    """Move a live child domain to a new placement, in place on the node.

    The three things this does, in the order they must happen:

    1. build the child afresh at the new placement from the LIVE parent,
       through the ordinary cold-start path, which also rebuilds the
       child's own grid, map factors and base state for where it now is;
    2. stamp the outgoing child's serialised state onto the overlap, so
       everything the child had integrated over ground it still covers
       survives the move bitwise;
    3. rebuild the coupler's SINT donor tables for the new placement, and
       classify the child's rolling boundary tables invalid -- they were
       built for a footprint that no longer exists.

    The parent is not written at any point.  ``parent_state_sha256`` in the
    returned receipt is taken before and after and compared, so that is a
    measured claim rather than an architectural one.

    ``child_node`` must be at rest: relocation is a cycle-boundary
    operation, and calling it with the parent leading the child would leave
    the rebuilt tables describing an instant the child has not reached.

    MEMORY -- TWO STAGINGS.  ``staging="device"`` allocates the incoming
    child while the outgoing one is still resident, so peak child
    residency is transiently doubled (a cycle-boundary cost, not a
    per-step one).  That was the right trade for proving the mechanism
    against the certified cold-start path, and it is the wrong trade for
    the user this feature is FOR: the point of a moving nest is a low-VRAM
    card running a smaller nest at higher resolution, and a card that
    cannot hold two children cannot move one.  ``staging="host"`` is the
    production answer: snapshot the outgoing child's serialised state
    (plus the SINT base fields the alignment instrument needs) to pinned
    host buffers, RELEASE the outgoing device allocation, build the
    incoming child into the bytes the allocator just got back, and upload
    the overlap from host.  D2H and H2D are byte transports, so the two
    stagings are bitwise-identical on the overlap -- asserted by
    tests/test_nest_relocation_staging.py, not assumed.  The receipt's
    ``staging`` block carries live-pool samples around each phase so the
    peak claim is measured, never architectural.

    Host staging is the DEFAULT.  With ``"device"`` as the default, every
    caller that did not name a staging (the relocation verification case
    among them) held the outgoing and the incoming child on the card at
    once, with nothing pricing the second one, while the production
    runner passed ``"host"`` explicitly; a card that fit the tree could
    run out of memory at a move only such a caller made.  ``"device"``
    stays available by name, for the equivalence tests that compare the
    two stagings.

    ATOMICITY UNDER HOST STAGING, STATED ACCURATELY.  The in-device path
    leaves the tree untouched on any refusal.  The host path releases the
    outgoing child before the rebuild, so a failure AFTER the release
    (an allocation failure, or the donor-alignment self-check tripping on
    a code defect) leaves the child unusable and the run over.  The
    off-parent refusal -- the one plausible input error -- is evaluated
    BEFORE the release (:func:`_prevalidate_placement`), so what remains
    behind the release is the class of failure that would have killed the
    run anyway.  ``on_before_release`` is the executor's seam for dropping
    its own references (health validators) so the release actually frees;
    it fires only on the host path, immediately before the release.

    SCOPE, STATED SO IT CANNOT BE ASSUMED AWAY.  What THIS PRIMITIVE moves
    is the restart layer's serialised state (:func:`relocatable_attrs`).
    Physics CONTINUATION state -- precipitation accumulators, scheme
    timers, surface fields held by the driver -- is not in that contract:
    it is the ``on_child_built`` preparer's to carry.  The front-door
    route preparers (:class:`woof.runtime.RealRelocationChildPreparer`
    and the prepared-tree subclass) DO carry it -- the land-surface
    continuation fields by donor-filled transplant, the registry-
    derived per-column driver state (KF timers/held rates, precipitation
    accumulators, W0AVG) and the surface-radiation carriers with their
    provenance ledger, both through
    :mod:`woof.core.physics_continuation` -- because a preparer that
    re-initialised it cold-restarted cumulus on the whole child at every
    move (the 2026-08-16 moving-nest KF artifact report) and left the
    moved child with no producer for GLW between radiation calls (the
    2026-08-24 a development machine campaign refusal).  A bespoke ``on_child_built``
    that carries nothing still gets a cold child, and its receipt says
    so (``accumulators_reinitialized``).

    """``(node, delta_i, delta_j)`` for every descendant of a mover.

    WHAT A DESCENDANT EXPERIENCES.  When a mid-tree domain relocates, its
    children do NOT change placement -- a child's ``i_parent_start`` is an
    offset inside its parent, and the parent carried it along -- but the
    GROUND under them moved by exactly the parent's displacement.  So a
    descendant needs the same treatment the mover needs (statics rebuilt
    for the new ground, overlap transplanted, fresh strip filled from its
    parent) and none of the placement arithmetic.

    THE ARITHMETIC, AND WHY IT STAYS EXACT.  ``shift_i`` is the mover's
    placement change in ITS parent's cells.  Descending one level
    multiplies the displacement by that level's refinement ratio, so a
    move of ``di`` cells of the mover's parent is::

        mover's own cells        di * r_mover
        a child of the mover     di * r_mover * r_child
        a grandchild             di * r_mover * r_child * r_grandchild

    Every factor is an integer, so every descendant's displacement is a
    WHOLE number of its own cells -- which is the property the whole
    design rests on (a pure index-space copy, and SINT statics that are
    bitwise identical on the overlap).  A moving mid-tree domain is
    therefore not a weaker operation than a moving leaf; it is the same
    operation applied down a chain of exact integer ratios.

    The returned delta is expressed in each descendant's OWN PARENT's
    cells, which is the frame :func:`plan_relocation` wants, so
    :func:`plan_descendant_reground` can hand it straight over.

    ``earth_fixed`` names descendants that COMPENSATE instead of riding
    along: their placement moves by ``-delta`` so their earth position
    does not move at all.  The walk does not descend past one -- its own
    subtree experiences zero net ground displacement (the ancestor's
    displacement and the compensation cancel exactly, both being whole
    numbers of the same cells), so there is nothing to re-ground below
    it.  A grandchild of the mover whose parent rides along still gets
    its row.

    BOTH placements handed to :func:`plan_relocation` are synthetic.  The
    descendant's placement never changed, so there is no real pair to
    give; what the transplant needs is only their DIFFERENCE, which is
    the ground displacement in the descendant's parent's cells.

    They are also BIASED to stay >= 1.  ``Placement`` enforces 1-based
    WRF namelist semantics, and a westward/southward move of a
    descendant already near its parent's low edge drives a naive
    ``i_parent_start - delta`` negative -- which refused a move that is
    perfectly admissible.  Adding the same offset to both sides leaves
    the difference, and therefore the plan, untouched.

    So the placements inside the returned plan are an artefact of reusing
    the planner and are NOT a record of where anything sits; the accurate
    record is ``delta_parent_cells`` on the relocation receipt.

    Reusing the same planner rather than writing a second one is
    deliberate: the disjoint test, the overlap-cell count and the index
    arithmetic the leaf path is asserted against are the ones a

    -- the placement is part of the restart identity, so a tree that has
    moved must not share a fingerprint with the tree as built.  Chaining

    mark) and one-way: no fresh build ever computes a marked value, so a
    checkpoint written after a move refuses to resume into a fresh run BY
    CONSTRUCTION, and the refusal names relocation instead of shrugging a

    resume across a move; per the 2026-08-06 ruling, nothing may.
