"""Forecast/setup state container with FP32 arrays on one explicit backend.

In its default CuPy forecast mode, ``DomainState`` owns *all* persistent
device memory. Native stock-WRF setup/export may explicitly use NumPy host
arrays instead. Everything is allocated
once in ``__init__`` (shapes depend only on ``RunConfig``); base-state and
coordinate arrays are filled in place by ``load_base``.  Nothing else in the
model may allocate persistent device arrays: transient work buffers must go
through :meth:`DomainState.scratch`.

Array layout is ``(nz, ny, nx)`` with x fastest.  Staggering (WRF-ARW):
``u (nz,ny,nx+1)``, ``v (nz,ny+1,nx)``, ``w``/``phi (nz+1,ny,nx)``.

        The sanctioned writer for ``phb``.  Besides the FP32 device copy
        it refreshes the two caches that are functions of it: the float64
        host snapshot behind ``height_half()``/``_dz_min``, and
        ``dphb_resid``.

        ``dphb_resid[k]`` is the float64 base layer thickness MINUS the
        float32 subtraction ``phb[k+1] - phb[k]`` the EOS kernel performs
        on the stored profile.  The kernel adds it back, recovering the
        thickness to ulp(dphb) instead of ulp(phb): over a 2400 m column
        at nz=64 that is ~368 J/kg reconstructed from two ~2.4e4 J/kg
        numbers, so FP32 storage alone costs 5e-6 relative and the cost
        grows as 1/dz (measured 2.1e-6 at nz=16, 2.9e-5 at nz=160 in p).

        The residual spelling, rather than a stored absolute thickness,
        is deliberate: it is what makes this cache SAFE to be stale.  A
        caller that assigns ``state.phb[...]`` directly leaves the
        correction describing the previous profile, and the kernel then
        adds a <=1-ulp-of-phb number to the correct FP32 difference of
        the profile it was actually handed -- the pre-fix answer, never a
        wrong one.  A stored thickness would instead diagnose the OLD
        column's alt, and so a wrong p, pressure-gradient force and
        acoustic sound speed.  ``height_half()`` has no such protection,
        which is the other reason the in-tree writers come through here.
