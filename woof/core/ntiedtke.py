"""Launcher for New Tiedtke (``cu_physics = 16``).

Owns the ONE launch-geometry descriptor every stage runs under, and is the
only thing that launches ``woof/core/kernels/ntiedtke.cu``.

WHY THE DESCRIPTOR IS A TYPE AND NOT A CONVENTION
-------------------------------------------------
The column workspace is per-block and lane-interleaved -- element ``k`` of
slot ``s`` for lane ``t`` at ``block_base + (s*nz + k)*LANES + t`` -- so a
column's slots belong to one ``(block, lane)`` pair for the WHOLE stage
sequence.  Launch one stage on a different threads-per-block or a different
grid and that column resumes on a different lane, reading another column's
state.  Nothing crashes.  Every number stays finite.

It is also the one guarantee with no analogue in the Fortran, so no
comparison against the reference can catch it -- and this project's culture
is kernel performance work.  ``ntiedtke_cutypen`` is at 91 registers;
someone will want to re-tile it for occupancy, and re-tiling one stage is
precisely the thing that must be impossible.

So:

* :class:`NtLaunchGeometry` is frozen and computed once per step.
* :class:`NtStages` methods take **no grid or block argument at all**.
  There is no per-stage override to reach for -- changing the tile means
  changing the descriptor, which changes every stage together.
* Every kernel additionally REPORTS the geometry it actually observed and
  refuses to compute when it disagrees with what it was promised, so a
  launch routed around this module fails loudly instead of silently
  reading another column.

``tests/test_ntiedtke_launch_geometry.py`` is the gate on the last point.

#: CORRECTED.  This was documented as "the workspace's lane count, not a
#: tuning knob", on the assumption that the kernels would use a per-block
#: lane-interleaved workspace.  THEY DO NOT: there is no such workspace
#: (see docs/ntiedtke/PORT-RECORD.md §7), and every kernel indexes its arrays by the
#: GLOBAL column `a[k*ncol + i]`.  The kernels are therefore already
#: tile-independent and 32 is a FREE TUNING KNOB, not a correctness
#: constraint.

#: It is still refused below, and the descriptor is still the single place
#: a tile is chosen -- that mechanism is worth keeping and is what a tile
#: cap would be introduced through -- but the reason is now "one deliberate
#: choice per step" rather than "the layout is keyed on it".
#:
#: 32 is one warp per block, which caps occupancy through the

#:
#: cumastrn:1026 calls cududvn with ``zmfuus``/``zmfdus``, the pair the

#: out 2.9999996 to 3.0000032 times WRF's across all twelve affected words,

class NewTiedtke:
    """Stateless ``cu_physics = 16`` callable for :class:`PhysicsDriver`.

    No ``nca_seconds``: New Tiedtke carries no NCA hold, so the Task-1
    attachment contract applies -- the rates replace the held cumulus
    tendencies wholesale and ``rainc`` is a per-due-call increment consumed
    once.  ``cudt_minutes`` is pinned to 0 by ``validate_run_config`` for
    exactly this reason: its RAINCV is ``rn/stepcu``, a per-call rate with
    no persistence, and a hold would reapply it every step.

    THE FOLD LIVES HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE.  WRF's cumulus driver pre-folds
    the radiative and boundary-layer lanes into the advective one for
    G3SCHEME and NTIEDTKESCHEME only::

        RTHFTEN = (RTHFTEN + RTHRATEN + RTHBLTEN) * pi
        RQVFTEN =  RQVFTEN + RQVBLTEN

    (``module_cumulus_driver.F:867-886``, read rather than inferred.)  Note
    the ``* pi``: the theta lane is multiplied by the Exner function, so
    what the scheme receives is a TEMPERATURE forcing, not a theta one.
    That is why ``cu_ntiedtke_pre_run`` takes ``thften`` into a scheme that
    works in T throughout.  A fold written as a plain sum -- which is how
    every prose description of it in this tree reads, including the
    registry's own warning -- would be wrong by a factor of Exner, roughly
    0.3 to 1.0 through the depth of the column.

    Grell-Freitas is NOT in WRF's fold list; it sums the lanes itself, so
    WOOF's dycore exports PURE ADVECTION and that export must not move.
    Doing the fold in the adapter is what keeps it that way.
