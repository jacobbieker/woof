"""The short-lived device probe: free VRAM, card load and the card's census.

One subprocess answers every question a caller asks the local card --
free and total memory, NVML utilization, and the local-memory census the
forecast fit prices against -- and exits, so the caller never stands up
a CUDA context of its own.

A LEAF MODULE ON PURPOSE: the standard library at module scope and one
function-local reach into :mod:`woof.local_gpu`, both of which the
standalone RW-WPS package stages.  That package does not carry the
forecast memory preflight (:mod:`woof.core.preflight`), which
re-exports every name here for its own callers.  While the probe lived
inside the preflight, the package's ``--preprocess-backend auto`` had no
load reading and kept a certified card another program held busy or
nearly full, where woof prepared on the CPU.  Anything this module
imports at module scope has to be staged by
``tools/build_rw_wps_release.py`` too.

    keeps them out of estimator mode (see

    in-process therefore keeps that context, and its device memory, for
    the rest of its life.  ``woof check`` can afford that: it exits on
    the next line.  The ``woof go`` orchestrator cannot: after its
    memory gate it lives for the entire chain as the stage runner and
    progress printer, and the context it stood up to ask one question
    sat on the card for the whole run -- measured 0.486 GiB on the RTX
    5090 -- as a consumer no term of the budget it had just computed
    names.  Asked here, the context lives and dies inside the probe

    The numbers are the same ones the in-process readers see (the probe
    runs ``sys.executable``, so it resolves the same CuPy), which is
    what keeps this gate and ``woof check`` from disagreeing about one
    card.  ``run`` is the ``subprocess.run`` seam, for tests.

    The numbers only.  A caller that must distinguish "no card" from "no
    runtime" -- the memory gate does, because those two answers licence
    opposite behaviour -- asks :func:`device_memory_probe_reason`.

    ``report_failure`` is for automatic preparation-backend selection.  A
    card the probe cannot read through CUDA (too full for a context, or
    held in exclusive-process mode) then returns the probe's failure
    report instead of ``None``: ``{"cuda_error": str, "nvml": {"used_bytes",
    "total_bytes", "utilization_gpu_percent"} | None}``, the NVML half
    being the selected card's pre-context sample.  Without it that card
    read as "no telemetry", auto kept CUDA, and the preparation then
    failed to allocate.  The fit never asks: to it such a card is still
    one that did not answer.  Only a CUDA runtime error makes that report;
    a failure of the probe's own (a device property read under another
    name, say) is still ``None``, missing telemetry, because nothing in
