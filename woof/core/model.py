    complete child from the analysis at its start time.  While the node's

    named the first build, both were on the card together for the whole

    missing state.  A streamed startup build that a route restores into a
    new host store is left to that route's initializer, which closes and

    domain-tree forecast).  That startup state is a

    radiation from its prepared cache with no
    :class:`woof.core.rrtmg_legacy.ParentOzoneProvider`, so no waiting
    child reads it either.
    ``streamed_owner`` is the stepper of a streamed child the DEFAULT road
    rebuilds resident (``woof run``): that road attached the stepper to a
    resident startup build, so its tile buffers are closed here and the
    startup state's arrays released like a resident child's, and
    :func:`woof.core.streaming.reattach_rebuilt_domain` binds it to the

    """Wire one :class:`ExperimentState` into ``execute_schedule``.

    STEP calls the domain's existing dycore, FORCE calls its node-facing
    coupler, and FEEDBACK walks the dormant three-phase transaction.  The
    clock module remains the only op-table walker and therefore the only
    source of runtime scheduling comparisons.

    ``relocation_runner`` is a
    :class:`woof.core.relocation_runner.RelocationRunner` constructed by
    the route (the route owns the child-physics preparer and, for
    ``follow = "provider"``, the live tracker).  It is consulted at every
    PERIOD_BEGIN -- the complete cycle boundary where all clocks are
    synchronized, so every relocation lands on a parent-step boundary --
    and a moved child gets a fresh health validator armed immediately.  A
    configuration that schedules relocation on a route that did not wire a
    runner refuses here, at start, rather than integrating a nest that
    silently never follows anything.

    ``pool_trim_per_period=None`` selects the platform default: release
    UNUSED cached blocks after each step and period on Windows, retain
    them elsewhere. On a shared Linux card, returning those blocks lets
    competing processes claim memory the next radiation step needs.
    Measured on Windows with four domains (2026-07-17 5-sim-min A/B): churn re-inflates
    the pool from ~21 to ~30 GiB held against ~20 GiB live, driving WDDM
    page demotion; per-period trimming held the pool at 21.5-23.4 GiB,
    kept the device below the demotion band, and cut wall time 32%.
    Byte-inert by construction -- free_all_blocks releases only unused
    cached blocks, never live allocations, so no computed value can
    change; allocator behavior is not part of any ratified comparator.
    Explicit booleans remain available for allocator forensics. The resolved
    rule and its reason are carried by the model into the run receipt.

    ``steppers`` is ``{grid_id: callable}``, the callable a STEP op steps
    that domain with.  ``None`` -- and any grid absent from a supplied
    mapping -- binds ``woof.core.dycore.step`` ITSELF, so an experiment
    that configures nothing runs the identical function through the
    identical call, not a wrapper that forwards to it.  A domain whose
    ``[tiles]`` fired binds a
    :class:`woof.core.streaming.StreamedDomain` instead, which has the
    same signature and advances the same domain by the same one model
    step -- out of a pinned host store, one tile of it on the card at a
    time.  Everything around the call is unchanged BECAUSE the loop is
    unchanged: the same clock refresh either side, the same health
    validators, the same ``refl_10cm_due`` handshake, the same history
    and restart ops on the same cadences.

    ``delayed_child_initializer`` optionally supplies a route's dated
    child analysis at activation. It receives the child node and exact
    clock and returns ``(initialized, prepared)`` with the same grid/state
    and prepared-case attributes as the ordinary case-data initializer.
    The executor still owns the clock refresh, coupler, initial feedback,
    health validation and activation marker. Omission uses the input catalog.

    ``step_observer`` is called once per DOMAIN per model time step,
    immediately after that domain's STEP op commits, with
    ``grid_id``/``step_count``/``model_seconds``/``step_wall_seconds``.
    It is what lets a front door print WRF's ``Timing for main:`` line
    per step (:class:`woof.progress_log.StepLog`); ``progress_callback``
    below cannot, because it fires once per ROOT step and a nest taking
    36 substeps inside one of those is invisible to it.  ``None`` -- the
    default -- adds one ``is not None`` test per STEP op and changes
    nothing else.
