"""Analytic terrain profiles (setup-time, pure NumPy float64).

Phase 2 Task 3: ``bell_hill`` builds the classic bell-shaped ridge (Witch
of Agnesi) used by the mountain-wave benchmarks.  The profile feeds
``grid.make_base_state(..., terrain_z=...)``, which is the terrain
authority for the run: the surface enters the model through the base
state (``phb[0] = g*h``, per-column dry mass), never through ``phi'``.
