"""UP_HELI_MAX -- WRF's updraft-helicity running-max diagnostic.

Transcribed from WRF v4.6.1 ``SUBROUTINE cal_helicity``
(dyn_em/module_diffusion_em.F:7132-7579, pinned tree
d66e442fccc04111067e29274c9f9eaccc3cef28), with the metric prep it consumes
(``compute_diff_metrics``, :6882-7130) evaluated pointwise from the same
expressions.  Driver wiring in WRF:

- called EVERY model step when ``nwp_diagnostics == 1``
  (module_first_rk_step_part2.F:533-556; the namelist gate is
  Registry.EM_COMMON:2210, &time_control, default 0);
- integrates w times zeta over the fixed 2000-5000 m AGL band, only over
  layers ENTIRELY inside the band, aborting a column whose 8-point-average
  w is non-positive anywhere inside the band (:7474-7511);
- 9-point-smooths the column result and folds it into the running max
  ``UP_HELI_MAX`` (:7515-7533; Registry IO "rh02": restart + history,
  units "m2 s-2");
- the accumulator is zeroed at the start of each history interval
  (phys/module_diag_nwp.F:246-269).

This is a DIAGNOSTIC: nothing here writes any model-evolution array, and
tests pin that nothing in the package reads the accumulator back into the
trajectory.

Ratified divergences from WRF, recorded here and in the STEP17 handoff:

1. Sampling instant.  WRF samples the START-of-step state (cal_helicity
   runs inside the first RK step) and resets on the FIRST step AFTER a
   history write -- so each frame's max covers the open interval
   (T_prev, T_frame) EXCLUDING both endpoint states.  woof samples the
   completed step's state in the dycore epilogue and resets immediately
   after the frame is written: the window is (T_prev, T_frame] INCLUDING
   the emitted frame's own state.  The interior samples are identical; the
   difference is one endpoint sample per frame, and woof's frame max is
   always >= the instantaneous UH of the frame it rides in.
2. Substep cadence.  Under a compatibility integrator running internal
   substeps (dt = clock_dt/n), the max is folded EVERY internal step --
   the same self-consistent reading PROVENANCE.md D1 ratified for
   h_diabatic capture; the native-dt path restores WRF cadence unchanged.
3. Top-layer stand-in.  At the top mass layer WRF reads one-past-the-end
   wavg/rvort values its loops never wrote (uninitialised automatic
   arrays), guarded only by the zu <= 5000 m test; woof substitutes 0.0
   (which zeroes the column through the w > 0 test).  Reachable only with
   a model top below 5000 m AGL.
4. Halo edge write.  WRF's boundary copy writes up_heli_max(ide, j) /
   up_heli_max(i, jde) into staggered halo memory that never reaches any
   output; woof's (ny, nx) field has no such slot.  Consequence (shared
   with WRF's own emitted field): the east column and north row of
   UP_HELI_MAX stay exactly zero, and the west column / south row mirror
   their inward neighbours.

UNDER ``[tiles]``, THE RESET IS THE HARD PART, NOT THE FOLD.  The fold is
pointwise after a horizontal-radius-1 smooth, so it tiles like any other
carrier and is bit-exact against a resident run at every rung measured
(tilestream/test_uh_stream.py).  The three RESETS are whole-domain writes
arriving from outside the stepper, and a streamed domain's arrays are in the
tiling store rather than on the ``DomainState`` the consumers hold -- so a
reset written to the state left the real accumulator running and every window
silently became "max since the run began", biasing the tracker and the spawn
trigger toward firing early and never releasing.  Every reset here therefore
goes through :func:`woof.core.streaming.live_scratch`, and every READER of a
window (woof/core/storm_tracking.py) through
:func:`~woof.core.streaming.domain_scratch`.  Resident, both are exactly
``state.existing_scratch(slot)`` and nothing changed.

The oracle for the transcription is tools/uh_wrf461_oracle (fixtures under
woof/data/uh/oracle); tests/test_uh_wrf461_parity.py holds the NumPy
mirror and the CUDA kernel at the recorded ULP baseline against it.

#: The serialized accumulator slot (restart-carried, wrfout-emitted).

#: HOW FAR THE DIAGNOSTIC REACHES HORIZONTALLY, in mass cells, and why a
#: streamed run has to widen its halo by exactly this much.
#:
#: Two stencils compose, and it is their SUM that matters:
#:
#: 1. the column value at ``(j, i)`` reads ``(j-1..j, i-1..i)`` -- the
#:    vorticity's ``dv/dx``/``du/dy`` differences and the 8-point ``w``
#:    average, all backward-staggered (:7305-7388, :7458-7462); radius 1.
#: 2. the 9-point smoother then reads the COLUMN VALUES at ``(j+-1, i+-1)``
#:    (:7515-7533); radius 1 again, on top of the first.
#:
#: So ``UP_HELI_MAX`` at one point depends on model state two cells away,
#: and it is evaluated in the dycore EPILOGUE -- at the END of a step,
#: when a tile's halo has already been invalidated from the outside in by
#: that step's own dependency cone.
#:
#: MEASURED AT THE 2.2.0 CUT, and this is the whole argument.
#: ``tilestream.harness.halo_radius`` prescribes 16 against a measured
#: minimum of 14 for the carrier set, i.e. exactly 2 cells of margin --
#: which this diagnostic consumes entirely, leaving none.  A 438x350x49
#: streamed run at tile 200x200 came back bit-identical to its resident
#: twin in 74 of 75 fields, and differed in ``UP_HELI_MAX`` at ONE cell,
#: ``(j=331, i=200)``, by 1.16e-10 -- one float32 ULP, at exactly the
#: first interior column of the second tile, which is the signature of a
#: stencil reaching one cell past what the halo still guarantees.  The
#: same run at halo 18 is bit-identical in all 75 fields at every frame.
#:
#: The forecast is NOT affected either way: the trajectory is bit-exact
#: for any halo at or above the measured 14, so widening changes only the
#: diagnostic, and it costs 4 cells on each window axis (MEASURED on that
#: run: 232x232 -> 236x236, 6.61 -> 6.71 GiB).
UH_DIAGNOSTIC_HALO_CELLS = 2

#: CONSUMER-OWNED tracking windows (ArWen's ruling, 2026-08-07).
#:
#: Same operator as UP_HELI_MAX and the same fold below -- what differs is
#: WHO RESETS.  UP_HELI_MAX is zeroed by the history writer, so its window
#: is the output cadence; a model consumer reading it therefore has its
#: decisions moved by an output knob, which is how ``--history-interval``
#: came to steer a storm-following nest.  Each of these is zeroed by the
#: consumer that reads it, immediately after it reads, so its window is
#: "max since I last looked" and nothing else.
#:
#: TWO of them, not one, because the two consumers evaluate on genuinely
#: different granularities: relocation at cadence boundaries inside one
#: ``execute_experiment`` call, spawn at LEG boundaries through schedule
#: surgery (woof/core/spawn_runner.py's opening note).  A shared window
#: would let whichever consumer read first blind the other at any
#: boundary they happen to share.
#:
#: The names deliberately do NOT contain "up_heli_max": these are not the
#: WRF diagnostic, they are never emitted, and the governance roster in
#: tests/test_uh_lifecycle.py pins that slot's readers by substring.
