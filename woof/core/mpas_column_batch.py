"""Persistent MPAS column-batch physics seam (``run_mpas_column_batch``).

THE COUNTERPARTY CONTRACT (MPAS side, pinned 2026-08-10)
--------------------------------------------------------
An MPAS CUDA dynamical core drives this seam with C-contiguous CuPy
float32 arrays shaped ``[level, column]`` (column fastest, ``k = 0`` the
LOWEST model level; interface fields ``[level + 1, column]``).  Two calls
per model step, strictly alternating:

* **Phase 1** (pre-RK, at time t): run the ARW physics chain -- legacy
  RRTMG radiation, revised-MO surface layer, Noah-MP, YSU, GF or KF
  cumulus -- on the caller's columns and return the complete
  currently-held set of RAW A-grid ``du/dv/dtheta/dq*`` physical rates.
  NO ARW mass coupling, NO A-to-C face interpolation, NO ``cp.roll``, NO
  map factors: where the ARW step converts rates into its coupled slow
  tendencies (``couple_ysu_tendencies``/``couple_column_tendencies`` in
  woof/core/physics.py, consumed by ``PhysicsTendencies.add_to_slow`` at
  woof/core/dycore.py:2394), this seam stops short and hands back the
  rates those functions would have consumed.  Phase 1 NEVER mutates a
  caller array: every input is copied once into seam-owned buffers, and
  the MPAS negative-qv law (their stock init carries small negative qv
  values) is honoured by clamping ``max(qv, 0)`` in the seam's own
  scratch copy, exactly as MPAS bulk physics does -- never by refusing.
* **Phase 2** (post-RK/transport): run WSM6 IN PLACE on the caller's
  arrays -- all six species ``qv/qc/qr/qi/qs/qg`` plus ``theta`` are
  updated in the caller's memory through zero-copy ``[nz, 1, ncol]``
  views.  The precipitation buckets accumulate in the seam and the
  retained microphysics heating ``h_diabatic`` (K/s) is captured with
  WRF's ``mp_tend_lim`` clamp (woof/core/microphysics.py
  ``moist_physics_finish``); ARW feeds that field to every RK step's
  theta tendency (woof/core/dycore.py:2396 ``add_h_diabatic_tendency``),
  so phase 1 republishes it as ``h_diabatic`` for the MPAS side to apply
  or decline explicitly -- it is NOT folded into ``dtheta``.

THE ORCHESTRATION IS THE ARW ORCHESTRATION
------------------------------------------
Phase 1 calls ``PhysicsDriver.compute`` -- the same function object the
ARW step invokes at woof/core/dycore.py:2325 -- on a persistent driver
built by the same ``initialize_physics``.  Radiation runs on its own
cadence and its rates are HELD and returned on non-due calls;
surface/Noah-MP state advances; KF NCA holds and expiry, W0AVG trigger
history, RAINC/RAINBL accumulation and the call counters are all the
driver's own.  Phase 2 calls ``woof.core.microphysics.apply`` followed
by ``PhysicsDriver.accept_microphysics``, the exact post-RK pair from
woof/core/dycore.py:2507-2510.  The class attributes
``_PHASE1_ORCHESTRATION`` / ``_PHASE2_MICROPHYSICS`` hold those function
objects and the contract tests assert identity, so a rewrite of this
seam into thin per-kernel wrappers goes red.

HOW RAW RATES COME OUT OF A COUPLED DRIVER
------------------------------------------
The column-batch state is built so ARW mass coupling is the IDENTITY:
``c1h = 1``, ``c2h = 0``, total dry mass ``mub2d + mup = 1.0`` exactly,
map factors 1 with ``has_msf = False``, and neither ``specified`` nor
``nested`` set.  ``chm = c1h*mu + c2h = 1.0`` makes every mass-coupled
scalar tendency bit-identical to its raw physical rate (an FP32 multiply
by 1.0 is exact), so the driver's held/composed ``rtheta/rq*`` stacks
ARE the raw rates, with the driver's own hold and KF-expiry semantics
intact.  Momentum is different: ``couple_ysu_tendencies``
face-interpolates du/dv onto C-grid staggers (its ``cp.roll``), so the
seam takes du/dv from the driver's retained RAW YSU output
(``last_ysu``, retained because the seam always runs a positive
``bldt``) and holds its own serialized copy across non-due steps and
restarts.

GRID ADAPTATION (data marshalling only)
---------------------------------------
``PhysicsDriver.compute`` derives its per-step atmosphere through
``_prepare_atmosphere``, whose ARW body destaggers C-grid winds and
rebuilds hydrostatic pressure from the ARW mass coordinate.  Both are
grid transforms this batch must not receive: MPAS winds are already
A-grid and MPAS pressures are already the physics pressures.  The state
therefore carries ``prepared_physics_atmosphere``, the supplied-product
seam ``_prepare_atmosphere`` consults first, and this module fills the
SAME dict keys from the caller's fields with the SAME derivation
formulas (exner from ``(p/p0)^(Rd/cp)``, ``T = theta*exner``, physics
density ``(1 + qv)*rho_dry`` for WRF phy_prep's ``(1+qv)/alt``).  No
physics is reimplemented here.

COPIES, STATED
--------------
Per phase-1 call the seam copies each input once into a persistent
internal buffer (11 level fields + 3 interface fields), derives 4 more
(exner when absent, temperature, dz, rho), and copies the harvested
tendencies once into the persistent output buffers.  Phase 2 copies
nothing in or out of theta/species (zero-copy reshape views); it fills
two internal buffers (``alt = 1/rho_dry`` and ``php = z_interface*g``,
one kernel op each) whose round trips cost at most 1 ULP (documented
divergence: WSM6's adapter derives ``rho = 1/alt`` and ``z = php/g``,
woof/core/wsm6.py:109-112).  The returned tendency arrays are
seam-owned and valid until the NEXT phase-1 call; callers that hold
them longer must copy.

RESTART LAW
-----------
``export_state()`` (legal only at a step boundary, i.e. before a phase-1
call) returns a host-side payload covering every persisted item: the
driver manifest woof/io/restart.py builds (fields, held tendency
stacks, raw radiation rates, pending RAINBL, KF ``w0avg``, legacy-RRTMG
``o33d``), every serialized scratch bucket (``mp_*``, ``cu_*``), the
seam's held raw-output buffers, ``h_diabatic``, the WSM6 radii, and the
exact-integer step/cadence bookkeeping.  Since schema v2 the payload's
scalars also carry ``"carriers"``, the radiation CarrierContract
provenance (see the RESTART_SCHEMA comment).  ``restore_state()`` on a
freshly constructed seam with the identical configuration copies
everything back in place; a restored seam continues bit-identically
(GPU-gated test).  The transported species and theta live on the
MPAS side and restart with the caller's own state.

MICROPHYSICS SCHEMES (2026-08-31; mp=28 2026-09-01)
---------------------------------------------------
``microphysics_scheme`` selects the phase-2 scheme and, with it, the
transported species set (:data:`_SPECIES_BY_SCHEME`):

* ``"wsm6"`` (the default, and the pinned 2026-08-10 counterparty
  contract above, unchanged to the byte): the six mass species
  ``qv/qc/qr/qi/qs/qg``, hail-mode knob ``wsm6_hail_opt``, WSM6
  background radii, seven precipitation buckets.
* ``"p3"`` (mp_physics=50, P3 one-category two-moment ice): the EIGHT
  scalars WRF's own mp=50 driver arm transports
  (module_microphysics_driver.F:1569-1602 into mp_p3_wrapper_wrf) --
  the four moist masses ``qv/qc/qr/qi`` plus ``ni`` (ice number),
  ``nr`` (rain number) and the rime pair ``qir`` (rime mass) / ``qib``
  (rime volume).  P3 has ONE ice category: it writes neither ``qs``
  nor ``qg``, so the seam refuses them by name instead of carrying two
  frozen species the scheme never touches (the silent-zero-field
  substitution woof/core/state.py's mp=50 arm documents).  The P3
  cross-step supersaturation carriers ``th_old``/``qv_old``
  (module_mp_p3.F:5018-5021) are seam-owned state and ride the restart
  payload beside the radii; the diagnostic trio vmi/di/rhopo stays in
  rebuild-class adapter scratch and is not transported.  Phase-1 is the
  same ARW chain either way; no phase-1 scheme produces a snow, graupel
  or number-moment tendency, so the raw-rate result keeps its fixed ten
  buffers with ``dqs``/``dqg`` structurally zero under P3 (exactly the
  standing ``dqg`` convention).  Phase-2 P3 consumes the EOS pressure
  and ``z_interface`` only -- its kernels derive density from pressure
  where the authority does -- so ``rho_dry`` is refused there rather
  than accepted and silently dropped.  A ``"p3"`` seam's restart
  identity carries ``"microphysics": "p3"``; a ``"wsm6"`` identity is
  byte-identical to schema v2 before this arm existed, so stored WSM6
  payloads keep restoring and a cross-scheme restore refuses on the
  identity gate.
* ``"thompson_aero"`` (mp_physics=28, aerosol-aware Thompson): the
  ELEVEN scalars WRF's own mp=28 driver arm transports
  (module_microphysics_driver.F's THOMPSONAERO arm into
  ``mp_gt_driver``) -- WSM6's six masses ``qv/qc/qr/qi/qs/qg``, the
  three number moments ``ni``/``nr``/``nc``, and the two aerosol
  number tracers ``nwfa`` (water-friendly) / ``nifa`` (ice-friendly).
  ``nc`` is PROGNOSTIC here, which is the whole difference from
  classic Thompson (Registry.EM_COMMON:3036), so a route that carried
  mp=8's two moments and let the seam default the other three would
  run the aerosol physics on substituted state; both directions of
  slack refuse by name.  There is no ``nbca``: WRF allocates the
  black-carbon scalar in the mp=28 package (Registry.EM_COMMON:3036)
  but ``mp_gt_driver`` reads and emits it only under
  ``wif_input_opt=2`` and zeroes it otherwise (module_mp_thompson.F
  :1322-1325, :3983-3988), WOOF refuses that option by name
  (woof/config.py's MP28_AEROSOL_SOURCE_OPTIONS) and no WOOF state
  allocates the species, so the seam refuses it rather than carrying
  an exact zero.  Radii are WSM6's own backgrounds -- ``mp_gt_driver``
  seeds re_qc/re_qi/re_qs from the same RE_*_BG parameters and clamps
  them identically for both Thompson entries (:1466-1479) -- and all
  three ride the restart payload.  The mp=28 cross-step carriers are
  the two SURFACE aerosol emission tendencies ``nwfa2d``/``nifa2d``
  (# kg-1 s-1, Registry.EM_COMMON:492-493): ``mp_gt_driver`` takes
  them INTENT(IN) (:1098) and only reads them (:1320-1321), and
  nothing between a resume and the next microphysics call can rebuild
  them from the caller's transported state, so they are seam-owned
  state on the restart payload -- the same argument th_old/qv_old ride
  under P3.  Receipts and buckets are the full seven-slot WSM6 shape
  (mp=28 has a graupel category and its driver arm binds
  GRAUPELNC/GRAUPELNCV, module_microphysics_driver.F:1029-1091).
  Phase-2 mp=28 REFUSES ``rho_dry`` for P3's reason with mp=28's
  authority: ``mp_gt_driver`` builds its own rho from the EOS
  pressure, temperature and vapour at :1802 and the adapter never
  reads ``state.alt``, so an accepted input would be silently unread.

  THE AEROSOL INITIAL STATE (FIRST CONTACT).  ``thompson_init`` is
  WRF's once-per-domain aerosol initialization: two independent
  ``MAXVAL`` tests on the domain's own ``nwfa``/``nifa`` (:490/:528),
  a synthetic CCN/IN profile for whichever is absent (:493-551) and,
  with the CCN fill, the surface emission ``nwfa2d`` from the lowest
  level (:509-510).  The seam runs the port of exactly that
  (woof/core/microphysics_aerosol.py ``thompson_aerosol_init_fill``)
  ONCE, at the FIRST ``run_phase2`` call of a freshly constructed
  seam, on the caller's bound arrays with the caller's own
  ``z_interface`` geometry -- the first moment the seam holds the
  state WRF's init tests.  A caller that transports no aerosol (the
  hex route today) gets WRF's synthetic profile and emission in its
  own arrays; a caller that brings its own aerosol takes WRF's
  has_CCN/has_IN branches (no fill), and ``nwfa2d`` then derives from
  the caller's lowest level by real.exe's climatology-branch formula
  (dyn_em/module_initialize_real.F:4518-4519, the same expression as
  :509-510).  ``nifa2d`` is zero in every WRF branch (real.exe
  :4508 and :4524-4529; ``thompson_init`` never takes it).  The seam
  therefore
  stages no WIF climatology and requires none -- its RunConfig names
  that as ``mp28_aerosol_source="synthetic"`` -- and a caller's real
  aerosol is never overwritten.  ``aerosol_init_receipt`` reports
  which branches ran; it rides the restart payload so a restored seam
  never re-fills a checkpointed field.  Phase 1 never reads the
  aerosol fields on this seam (only MYNN under ``bl_mynn_mixscalars``
  does, and the seam runs YSU), so first contact in phase 2 loses no
  physics against WRF's init-before-first-step ordering.  The cold
  start ``initialize_physics`` runs at construction sees only the
  seam's zero placeholder buffers with no geometry; its product is
  discarded (reset to zero) and its receipt is not the seam's.

        ``theta`` and every transported species (the constructor's
        ``microphysics_scheme`` row) are updated IN the caller's memory
        (zero-copy views); the remaining inputs are read-only.  The
        caller's integrator clamps scalar state before this call (pinned
        contract), so no clamp is applied here.

        WSM6 alone requires ``rho_dry`` (its adapter derives
        rho = 1/alt); the P3 and aerosol-aware Thompson rows REFUSE it,
        because both build density from the EOS pressure inside their
        own kernels -- P3 where module_mp_p3.F does, mp=28 at
        module_mp_thompson.F:1802 -- and an accepted-but-unread input
        reads as configuration the run does not have
        (:data:`_RHO_DRY_REFUSAL_BY_SCHEME`).  Returns per-call surface
        diagnostics as ``[column]`` copies: ``rainncv``/``snowncv``
        (mm) and ``sr`` for every scheme, plus ``graupelncv`` for the
        rows with a graupel category (WSM6 and mp=28).  P3's one ice
        category has no graupel species, and a permanent zero key would
        let a consumer claim a field the scheme never has (the mp=50
        five-slot argument in woof/core/physics_inventory.py).

        On a ``"thompson_aero"`` seam the FIRST call of a freshly
        constructed seam runs ``thompson_init`` on the caller's bound
        arrays before the microphysics step (module docstring, FIRST
        CONTACT): WRF's two ``MAXVAL`` tests decide per field whether
        the caller brought aerosol, the synthetic profile fills whichever
        is absent, and ``nwfa2d`` derives from the lowest level either
        way.  ``aerosol_init_receipt`` reports what ran; a restored seam
        carries the receipt and never re-fills.

        ``refl_10cm_due`` is WRF's history-step ``diagflag``: when True the
        scheme adapter computes REFL_10CM inside the same microphysics call
        from its post-call temperature and the unchanged prepared pressure
        (woof/core/refl.py, PROVENANCE.md D2 -- exactly where WRF and native
        MPAS-A compute ``refl10cm``), and the receipt gains ``refl_10cm`` as
        a seam-owned ``(nz, column)`` device copy.  Computing it after this
        call instead would pair post-scheme temperature with re-derived
        post-scheme pressure, which is a different field than WRF defines.
