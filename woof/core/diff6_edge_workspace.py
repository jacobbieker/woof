"""The declared working set of the fork's edge-to-edge sixth-order filter.

``diff_6th_form = "noaa_wrf39"`` (the NOAA WRFV3.9 fork, the request default
of every HRRR recipe source and of ``hrrr_wrf.nl`` namelists in
``woof/data/physics_sources/request-defaults.v1.toml``) runs
:func:`woof.core.dycore.launch_diff6_to_edge` on every specified or nested
domain.  That launcher runs the unchanged diff6 kernel on copies of its
inputs padded with three zero-gradient halo cells (one more on the high
side), so it needs a padded field, a padded tendency, the four padded
planes (column mass and the three map factors) and, under the terrain-slope
taper, a padded base geopotential.

The breakage these slots close: until 2.8.6 those buffers were ``cp.pad``
and ``cp.zeros_like`` transients the run preflight never priced, on the
production HRRR route, growing with the nest (about three padded 3-D fields
and five padded planes per field per step).  A HRRR-route nest could pass
its memory check and still allocate them on top.  They are now
``DomainState.scratch`` slots priced by
:func:`woof.core.preflight.scratch_slot_registry` (and so by the ensemble
plans that read it), with a write-before-read row in the lifetime audit.

This module imports no cupy: the preflight prices it on CPU-only installs.
Shapes are flat element counts; the launcher takes a shaped prefix of each,
so one slot holds whichever row (u, v, w, mass or TKE) is being filtered.
