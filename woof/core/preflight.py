"""Memory preflight: itemized estimator, scratch registry, N0 ``--alloc``.

Phase-5 Task 11 (panel lane L4; folds robust-5), implementing architecture
section E of docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-phase5-nesting-architecture.md:
the all-resident four-domain decision is gated by an ENFORCED memory
estimate -- ``woof check --alloc`` constructs every persistent device
allocation for the experiment, runs zero steps, and reports the measured
pool/device numbers against the estimate and the measured WDDM budget.
Measured > estimate is a FAILING GATE (milestone N0, ledger records
``alloc_fits_wddm_budget`` / ``alloc_measured_le_estimate`` /
``alloc_estimate_le_wddm_budget`` -- F11 amendment: every leg blocks).

Three-tier model.  Tier 1 is exact arithmetic; tiers 2/3 are PROVISIONAL
POLICY calibrated on two controller measurements (the d01 run fixture
``n0-preflight-baseline.log`` and the N0
allocation probe ``n0-alloc-probe-r2.json``) -- the tier-2/3 constants
parameterize the reserve proposal for controller ratification; the tests
pin their ALGEBRA (calibration consistency), they do not and cannot
validate the model against independent evidence:

* TIER 1 -- LIVE ARRAYS.  Exact itemized persistent residency from shape
  formulas: (a) ``DomainState`` arrays (transcribed from
  ``woof/core/state.py``); (b) ``PhysicsDriver`` persistents per scheme
  (``woof/core/physics.py``: the surface fields dict, held tendency
  stacks, conditionally retained ``last_ysu`` output, scratch-aliased
  microphysics diagnostics, KF W0AVG + LUT d01-only, RRTMGP lat/lon +
  ozone); (c)
  every named scratch slot from the static registry below; (d) LBC
  residents -- d01 eager interval tables, children's rolling
  one-interval ``nest_*`` tables + F16's arena-aliased full-parent field
  + SINT geometry (the F4 NEST ALLOCATION MANIFEST); (e) the RRTMGP shared
  chunk workspace from
  the phase-maximum chunk formula, plus the per-domain radiation column
  packing and physics-prep transients that coexist with it inside a
  step.  d01 fixture cross-check: itemized residency 1.4544 GiB vs the
  measured full-physics pool-used peak 1.47 GiB (ratio 0.989; the
  residual ~17 MB is per-call KF/coupling transient tails owned by the
  15% headroom).
* TIER 2 -- POOL RETENTION (provisional).  CuPy's pool retains freed
  transient blocks it cannot re-bin.  The N0 probe measured alloc-time
  retention NIL (held - used = 16 MB); the d01 RUN fixture showed
  5.52 GiB held vs 1.47 used, i.e. retention is a run-churn phenomenon.
  ``pool_retention_residual_bytes()`` (fixture held minus the d01
  alloc-estimate basis) is the run-time reserve term; it belongs to the
  N5/N6 run gates, not the N0 allocation gate (split proposed below).
* TIER 3 -- DEVICE-SIDE FOOTPRINT.  ``cudaMemGetInfo`` sees the CUDA
  context, JIT modules, and non-pool allocations on top of the pool.
  The N0 probe measured a fresh allocation-only process at
  ``PROBE_DEVICE_OVERHEAD_BYTES`` = 1.39 GiB; the run fixture's
  apparent 5.72 GiB gap is thereby attributed to 12 h of other-process/
  WDDM drift and RETIRED from the model (kept only as
  ``CAL_FIXTURE_OVERHEAD_BYTES`` for the record).  The probe number is
  a lower bound on run-time overhead (zero steps JIT-compile almost
  nothing), so the run-gate reserve keeps margin above it.

RESERVE POLICY (plan Task 11, amended; controller ratifies at N0,
``--reserve-gib`` overrides): the budget is ALWAYS the MEASURED free
VRAM at startup minus the configured reserve -- never nominal 32 GiB.
Two proposals, split by gate (PENDING RATIFICATION):

* ``ReservePolicy.n0_alloc()`` -- the N0 allocation-gate reserve:
  probe-measured non-pool overhead + external margin (alloc-time
  retention measured nil).  The ``--alloc`` default.
* ``ReservePolicy.run_time()`` -- the N5/N6 run-gate reserve: adds the
  fixture-calibrated run-churn retention residual on top.

Robust-5 fold-ins: a headroom check runs before state construction and
before each high-water phase; persistent scratch is prewarmed at setup;
the RRTMGP ``column_chunk`` is the FIRST over-budget lever
(:func:`recommend_column_chunk`); OOM means record diagnostics and
terminate -- never ``free_all_blocks()``-and-continue.

STAGED-RESIDENCY CONTINGENCY (documented sketch ONLY -- no machinery, per
architecture section E fallback lever (3)): if the enforced chain cannot
fit even after the chunk lever and a transient-scratch shared arena, a
``StagedPlan`` would demote d04 (the dominant block) to staged residency:
its DomainState lives host-side pinned, uploaded per d03-step window,
with the coupler writing boundary tables into a device staging pool.
That is a DESIGN REOPEN materially changing lanes L6/L7 and is flagged as
the top risk; nothing here implements it.

CPU/GPU split: every estimator path is CPU-only (no cupy import); only
:func:`run_alloc_preflight` (the ``--alloc`` mode, controller-run) touches
the device.  The ``woof check`` CLI wiring ships as
:func:`register_cli` per the F2 ownership map -- the one-line ``cli.py``
hookup is a controller handoff commit at merge.

#: the only multi-domain Windows run with whole-run machine-wide VRAM
#: sampling; receipts in docs/thompson-rematch-20260728.md and the campaign
#: handoff) measured a true machine peak of 29,004 MiB = 30,412,898,304 B
#: against this estimator's footprint projection of 17,416,429,288 B -- a
#: ratio of 1.7462.  The projection misses CuPy pool retention across the
#: run and output/checkpoint write transients, so under WDDM it
#: under-projects the number the budget actually confronts.  The single
#: observation is rounded UP to 1.75 (an envelope must not under-round).
#:
#: LINUX -- 1.45 over the ITEMIZED ALLOC ESTIMATE, measured-preliminary.
#:
#: Three independent first-run pilots (2026-07-30) instrumented the
#: machine-wide peak across whole forecasts with nvidia-smi sampling:
#:
#:   ======  =====  ==========  ===========  ==========  ==========
#:   node    card   alloc est.  footprint    machine pk  pk / alloc
#:   ======  =====  ==========  ===========  ==========  ==========
#:   node 1  4090   7.20 GiB    11.31 GiB    9.54 GiB    1.32

#:   node 3  4070   3.51 GiB     4.90 GiB    4.04 GiB    1.15
#:   ======  =====  ==========  ===========  ==========  ==========
#:
#: Two things follow, and the second is the important one.
#:
#: 1. The peak lands at 0.79-0.82x the FOOTPRINT PROJECTION, not 1.75x.
#: 2. The footprint projection itself is wrong on Linux, because the two
#:    grid-independent constants it adds to the alloc estimate --
#:    ``pool_retention_residual_bytes`` (2.73 GiB) and
#:    ``PROBE_DEVICE_OVERHEAD_BYTES`` (1.39 GiB) -- are Windows-pool
#:    artifacts that did not appear in any of the three measurements.
#:    At node 3's refused 60x48 minimum layout they were 4.12 GiB of a
#:    5.38 GiB projection: 77% of the floor was constants, which is why
#:    shrinking the grid could not help and a 12 GiB card could not be
#:    sized at all while its GPU sat 66% idle.
#:
#: So on Linux the projection IS the itemized alloc estimate (see
#: :func:`platform_projection_constants`), and this factor is the
#: envelope over THAT.  1.45 clears the worst of the three observations
#: (1.32) by 10%.  Three runs on two card models are still not a
#: calibration: re-derive rather than tune.  Receipts:
#: ARWEN-NODE1-4090-PILOT-20260730.md,
#: ARWEN-NODE2-4090-CUDA128-WORLDWIDE-20260730.md,
#: ARWEN-NODE3-4070-12GB-FLOOR-20260730.md.
#:
#: Both are presented as OBSERVED envelopes, not models, and neither
#: changes any gate: the enforced numbers remain the itemized estimate and
#: the measured --alloc legs.
#: 2026-08-01 AMENDMENT -- the multiplier has no intercept, so its ERROR
#: CHANGES SIGN.  A 16 GiB fleet node (RTX 4080, Linux, driver 595.58.03,
#: machine-wide nvidia-smi sampled at 250 ms, GPU otherwise idle) measured
#: whole forecasts across a 6.6x span of grid sizes and found the x1.45
#: envelope OPTIMISTIC below ~3.5 GiB of itemized estimate and pessimistic
#: by 25-30% above it.  A 224x180 first-run domain was declared 3.99 GiB
#: and peaked at 4.38.  The two fleet datapoints that looked contradictory
#: -- a 5090 under-predicted by ~19%, this 4080 over-predicted by 25-30%
#: -- are one model with a missing intercept read at two grid sizes.
#:
#: The intercept is not a fitted nuisance: it is the NON-POOL residency
#: this module already itemizes (:func:`non_pool_device_bytes` -- the CUDA
#: context plus the launch-time local-memory backing store), which the
#: multiplicative form charged in proportion to the grid when it scales
#: with neither.  See :data:`ENVELOPE_UNMODELLED_BYTES` for the affine
#: replacement and the residuals behind it.
#:
#: These factors are RETIRED from every gate: the 2026-08-19 RTX 3080

#:
#: Three campaigns, two driver models, and the same boundary each time:

#: between calls and the itemization does not model it, while the

#:
#: What was wrong BEFORE this amendment, and it is the safety half: the

#: paragraph above said so: "re-measure there before exporting this term
#: -- the retention mechanism is a CuPy pool behaviour, not WDDM's, but

#: RE-MEASURED 2026-08-26 on the same RTX 3080, post-#310 build, after
#: the stale-guard audit of 2026-08-25 asked whether this was calibrated
#: against pre-#310 RRTMG pool behaviour.  Legacy lane, measured as
#: (pool_total_peak - alloc_estimate) / alloc_estimate, which is

#:
#: So the retention did fall, and post-#310 it also SHRINKS with grid
#: size (0.32, 0.26, 0.07 GiB absolute) instead of growing -- meaning
#: 0.20 is no longer a worst-case bound: it is marginally exceeded at
#: 60x48 and hugely conservative at 290x232, where memory actually
#: binds.  The term is KEPT and NOT re-fitted here, because the
#: comparison is not like-for-like: the pre-#310 rows are 6 h runs and
#: these are 2 h, and pool retention can build with run length.  A

    """Say out loud WHICH allocation this report prices.

    Every ENUMERATION in this module -- ``alloc_estimate_bytes``, the
    itemized peak envelope, the reserve, the whole N0 chain -- prices a
    domain resident in VRAM, and none of them has a concept of a tile
    buffer.  With ``[tiles]`` configured that is a fact the reader has to
    be told, because a report that shows only those figures is otherwise
    indistinguishable from one describing the run they actually asked for.

    What the report's BINDING figures now carry is the streamed envelope
    (:func:`estimate_phases` replaces the forecast term with it, and
    ``check_main`` compares the gate leg and the exit code against it), so
    the sentence below is a statement about the run the config asks for
    rather than a warning that the numbers are about a different one.

    REWRITTEN AT 2.2.0, TWICE OVER.  Both halves of what this used to say
    are now false, and a stale advisory is worse than none: it was the
    release's own headline feature telling users it does not work.

    * "this estimator has no model of a streamed domain" -- it does now.
      :func:`streamed_forecast_envelope` prices the tile working set, the
      buffers and the pinned store off the same measured
      :class:`tilestream.autoplan.Footprint` the run attaches with, and
      :func:`estimate_phases` puts that number in the forecast term.  So a
      refusal here is a statement about the run the config asks for.
    * "'on' is refused by the forecast routes, which wire no
      streamed-domain builder" -- they wire one as of 2.2.0
      (``prepared_single_domain_forecast``, ``prepared_domain_tree_forecast``),
      which is the whole point of the release.

    THE NESTED HALF WAS REWRITTEN AGAIN AT 2.6.1, for the same reason.
    It used to say a refusal or a fit below "describes the resident tree,
    not the mixed-road one the run will take" -- an advisory admitting the
    report had priced a run nobody asked for, and it sat beside an exit 1
    on trees whose mixed road (child streamed, parent resident) fits and
    completes.  Reproduced on the published 2.5.8 and 2.6.0 wheels.  A
    user read that pairing as "streaming has no point".  ``tree_road`` is
    the run door's own per-domain walk
    (:func:`woof.core.streaming.tree_road_plan`, the decide pass of
    ``steppers_for_tree``), so the sentence now states the road the run
    takes and the verdict beside it is asked of the same road.

    What remains worth saying is the one thing that is still true and still
    surprising: under ``mode = "auto"`` the DECISION is the planner's, taken
    against free VRAM at the instant the run starts, so a report written
    now can describe the other branch if the card's occupancy changes.

    Advisory, never a gate: it changes no exit code and blocks nothing,
    on the same posture as every other entry in :func:`check_advisories`.

    ONE DECISION PER REPORT.  ``envelope`` is accepted so a caller that
    has already priced the streamed forecast hands that envelope over
    rather than having this function derive a second one.  Under
    ``mode = "auto"`` the two derivations genuinely disagree: this one
    reached ``Machine.detect`` and planned against the card under the
    desk while the report's verdict planned against the card the reader
    declared, and one ``woof check --budget-gib 6`` printed "2 tile
    buffer(s) of 220x174 = 5.80 GiB" at the top and "2 tile buffer(s) of
    311x146 ... 6.17 GiB" in its binding-phase line.  ``machine`` is the
    same escape for a caller that has a card but not yet an envelope.
    ``source`` is the forcing source a caller that prices here itself
    knows, so the boundary tables it publishes are priced as the review's
    own (:func:`admission_estimate`).

# The dominant term is the LOCAL-MEMORY BACKING STORE.  When a kernel's
# per-thread local frame exceeds the context's default stack limit, the
# driver answers the kernel's first launch by allocating a backing store for
# the device's whole resident-thread capacity -- not for the launched grid --
# and keeps it for the life of the process.  One allocation serves the
# process, sized by the LARGEST per-thread frame launched so far, so the term
# is a MAXIMUM over launched kernels and is completely independent of domain
# count.  That is why the old estimator was short by the same ~5.5 GiB at
# three domains and at four.
#
# The law is exact on this device, verified against a synthetic kernel at
# five local-frame sizes and against two real forecasts:

# step across its first launch was 5,738.0 MiB, twice, in two separate runs.
# The baseline term ``default_stack_limit_bytes * capacity`` = 255 MiB is
# already inside :data:`CUDA_CONTEXT_BYTES`, which is why it is subtracted.

#: Per-module MAXIMUM static local frame per thread, in bytes, as the CUDA
#: driver reports it in ``CU_FUNC_ATTRIBUTE_LOCAL_SIZE_BYTES`` after NVRTC
#: compiles ``woof/core/kernels/<module>.cu`` with the shipped options and
#: NO integer defines injected -- i.e. at each module's unspecialized bound.
#:
#: THIS IS A CEILING OVER NAMED COMPILE PLATFORMS, not one box's reading.
#: A frame is what NVRTC emitted for one target architecture at one
#: compiler build, and measured three ways it moves with both: ``gf``,
#: ``noah``, ``thompson_aerosol_warm`` and ``ysu`` move with the
#: architecture at a fixed compiler, ``nssl2_fused_gs``, ``rrtmgp_cloud``
#: and ``shinhong`` move with the compiler build at a fixed architecture,
#: and ``noahmp_leaves`` moves with both.  The readings themselves, each
#: naming its box, its ``sm_`` target and its NVRTC build, live in
#: :mod:`woof.core.kernel_frame_recordings`; every row below is the
#: element-wise MAXIMUM over them, checked against them at import.
#:
#: Under-pricing is what a rail gate cannot survive -- one byte of frame
#: is one byte times the whole resident-thread capacity of device memory
#: nobody charged for -- so a platform nobody has measured is priced at
#: the ceiling, never at an average or at the nearest box.  Rows recorded
#: 2026-07-26 through 2026-08-20; regenerated and compared against the
#: compiler in front of it by ``tests/test_preflight.py::
#: test_the_recorded_local_frames_match_the_driver``, which asserts EXACT
#: equality only on a platform this tree has a recording for, and the
#: never-below-a-measurement invariant on every other.
#:
#: Two modules do not launch at their unspecialized bound: ``refl`` and
#: ``wdm6_refl`` compile their column arrays to the
#: configuration's own level count
#: (:data:`LEVEL_SPECIALIZED_KERNEL_FRAMES`), so their rows here are the
#: CEILING, not the price.  Three more are TIERED, and those are the only
#: ones that can price ABOVE their row.  ``acoustic`` compiles the implicit
#: w''-phi'' solve at a coarse ``WPHI_MAX_LEV`` tier chosen by ``nz``
#: (:data:`ACOUSTIC_TIER_FRAME`), so this row is its price at the shipped
#: 129 tier -- every ``nz <= 128`` configuration -- and the deeper tiers add
#: to it.  ``wdm6`` and ``wsm6`` are the same shape, each with a two-rung
#: ladder (:data:`WDM6_TIER_FRAME`, :data:`WSM6_TIER_FRAME`): each row is
#: that module's ``KMAX = 64`` default, every ``nz <= 64`` configuration,
#: and the 80 tier prices above it.
#: Everything else launches as compiled.
#:
#: A module maximum is an UPPER bound over the kernels a scheme can launch --
#: e.g. Morrison's launched sedimentation kernel measures 1,280 B against the
#: module's 5,120 B.  Over-pricing is the safe direction for a rail gate and
#: under-pricing is what put a run 1,630 MiB over; the bound is stated, not
#: silently tightened.

#: 28 is included: mp=28 routes REFL_10CM through the SAME Thompson

#: and already priced by this module's own microphysics row for mp=18; it

#: .py routes 9, 18 and 50 to their adapters and only 1, 6, 8, 10, 16 and

    THIS WAS A REFUSAL until 2026-08-29, and the refusal was right for as
    long as it stood: the distinct-array count was not derivable, and a
    silent zero in this sum would have let a run proceed under-budgeted
    with nothing to show for it.  Two things changed.

    First, the count is now MEASURED rather than estimated, because
    ``NtWorkspace`` allocates and can be counted: 89 level arrays, 37
    surface, and 11 level-sized scratch slabs ``cutypen`` slices out of
    one pointer.  The old docstring's worry -- that the union of kernel
    signatures gives 90 names of which many are the same storage under
    different Fortran spellings -- was exactly right, and 41 of them turned
    out to be aliases (docs/ntiedtke/PORT-RECORD.md section 33).

    Second, the old text argued New Tiedtke does NOT cap, because
    ``NtLaunchGeometry`` launches over the full column count.  True when
    written and false since: the ASSEMBLER caps at GF's tile and walks the
    domain in chunks, and the chunking gate proves the answer is
    byte-identical at 32, 64 and 108 columns.  So the analogy to
    :func:`gf_column_workspace_bytes` that the old text warned against is
    now the correct shape.

    BOTH THE CAP AND THE BYTE COUNT COME FROM ``woof.core.ntiedtke``.
    Neither is restated here.  A census formula living apart from the

    """SASE model-path transient live sets, one dict per phase.

    Exact transcription of the driver-coupled step's per-call device
    allocations (``woof/core/physics.py`` ``_run_sase`` +
    ``woof/core/sase.py`` ``launch_sase_step`` and the launchers it
    composes) on the MODEL path (per-column 3-D ``dz_col``, Task 6).
    Task-6 decision, documented here per the S3-5 pairing contract: the
    per-step temporaries REMAIN CuPy-pool allocations at this stage
    rather than moving into the shared scratch arena -- the pool
    reuses the freed blocks across steps so the steady-state device
    footprint equals this transcribed peak, while arena preallocation
    would require threading an allocator through six nested launchers
    and re-auditing ~58 slot lifetimes (revisit if the estimate ever
    pinches).  Any change to either side must update BOTH the launcher/
    driver and this transcription (the byte pin in tests/test_sase.py
    enforces the pairing).

    * ``solve`` -- the peak inside ``launch_dynamic_solve`` while
      ``launch_germano_lift`` runs on the second (width-4) test level:
      the driver-held work set (u/v A-grid work copies, destaggered w +
      its work copy, n2 plus its S4-2 M1 moist companion n2_eff -- the
      ``launch_moist_n2`` output held beside the dry field for the whole
      step (physics.py ``_run_sase`` step 2; both go down together into
      ``launch_sase_step``), and the ``heat`` output -- 7 full fields;
      the S3-6e governed scalar channel rides the step's exported km_h
      field, so the v0 pre-step e copy is RETIRED), the fused step's
      three PER-COLUMN z-stencil coefficient FIELDS (3-D dz_col mode;
      the (nz,) arrays of the shared-column test path are superseded on
      the model path), the six fine strains, six premultiplied
      eddy-basis integrands, three filtered velocities, six coarse
      strains, six refiltered basis fields, the lift's three filtered
      velocities + six velocity products + six filtered products + six
      lift outputs, and the width-2 iteration's still-referenced FP64
      ``(5, nblocks)`` partial-sum buffer: 58 full fields + partials
      (S4-3 amendment: was 57 pre-M1; the n2_eff field is 1/57 ~ 1.75%
      of the previous peak -- the S4-2 report note-1 obligation).  The
      S3-11b ``(ny, nx)`` float32 rho1 surface moist-density plane
      (``sase_surface_rho1``, computed once before the e source and held
      by the driver through the step-5 scalar-flux deposit, so alive in
      BOTH phases) is transcribed with it -- de-minimis at
      1/(57*nz) ~ 0.04% of the peak (the S3-11b report note-3 flag,
      absorbed explicitly here rather than left to the (nz,)-pack
      de-minimis precedent since this touch amends the pairing anyway).
      S4-5 amendment (the S4-3 in-task pairing law): the SASE-M2 deposit
      seam holds ONE new driver field in BOTH phases -- the pre-step
      ``e_sgs`` copy ``e_pre`` that freezes the venting limb's amplitude
      input (physics.py ``_run_sase``; theta/qv/qc/pressure are
      read-only through the whole slot, so ``e`` is the only state the
      limb needs frozen, and the limb cannot be evaluated beside the
      copy because its (1 - f) two-product blend needs the step's USED
      f).  One full 4*ncell field, 1/58 ~ 1.72% of the previous peak.
      It is NOT the v0 pre-step e copy the S3-6e governed scalar channel
      retired (that one fed ``launch_scalar_mix``'s coefficient mode and
      stays retired); it is a new field with a new consumer, and it is
      transcribed under the DISTINCT key ``driver_vent_e_pre``.  S4-5b
      Item 4b: the S4-5 build gave it the retired field's own key
      ``driver_e_pre`` and deleted the retirement guard that asserted
      that key absent, while stating here that ``driver_e_pre`` "is
      deliberately not its name" -- it was.  The suffixed key restores
      the guard's meaning: ``driver_e_pre`` is absent because the v0
      copy is retired, and the M2 seam's frozen copy is a different
      name.  The byte pin does not move (one ``(nz, ny, nx)`` float32
      field either way; re-derived at
      ``test_sase.test_sase_workspace_accounting_is_exact``).
      The launcher EXPLICITLY drops the previous width's six-field lift
      binding (``lift = None``) before the next width's allocations --
      without that drop the peak would be 6 fields higher; this
      transcription and the launcher are a bound pair (S3-5 review fix),
      so removing the drop requires re-pinning here.  The S3-6f
      partition-bound sub-moment (the ``(ny, nx)`` z_i column field and
      the FP64 ``(5, nblocks)`` w-sensor partials) runs AFTER the solve
      transients release and drops its references before the apply
      allocations -- transcribed in this phase as a covering superset
      (net far below the 57-field peak).
    * ``apply`` -- re-derived for the S3-6e governed split step's true
      allocation profile.  The peak sits at the ``sase_split_tendencies``
      launch: the same driver-held 7 + coefficient 3, the vertical
      channel's kv + leps fields (S3-6h: leps = the BL89 RANS
      dissipation limb, formerly the bare l_B), six strains, six
      stresses, the governed
      diffusivity km + smag-share r fields (S3-6e), TWO horizontal
      e-flux integrands (the vertical leg retired with the explicit
      step), and FIVE tendency fields (du, dv, dw, P_h,e, P_h,heat --
      the S3-6e production split) -- 33 full fields with the S4-3 M1
      n2_eff amendment, + the rho1 plane (S3-6f doc fix, kept for the
      record: the S3-6e text said 33 when the enumeration summed to 32
      pre-M1; the byte pin never drifted).  The launcher then
      DROPS the 13-field strain/stress/r binding before the
      Thomas/production/partials allocations (bound pair with this
      transcription, the S3-5 idiom), so the later sub-moments
      (momentum-Thomas FP64 ``(3, nblocks_col)`` partials -- the third
      row is the S3-6j dKE_sfc drag-work channel -- P_v, the
      S3-6e damping-taper weight field under damp_opt=3, the e-update
      FP64 ``(4, nblocks)`` partials) arrive net NEGATIVE; the partials
      buffers, P_v, and the taper field are transcribed anyway as a
      covering superset.  S4-5: the SASE-M2 seam's THREE
      ``(nz + 1, ny, nx)`` float32 face-flux planes and its
      ``(ny, nx)`` FP64 cap-rescale plane are allocated in this phase,
      after the split step returns and before the scalar loop, and are
      transcribed here for the same covering-superset reason (they land
      after the 13-field strain/stress/r drop, so the apply phase's own
      peak does not move; the solve phase continues to dominate the
      category bound by **20.01 full fields** at 49x250x250 and at
      49x501x501, 19.59 at the test configuration -- S4-5b Item 5b,
      MEASURED this session from :func:`sase_workspace_phases` itself
      as ``(sum(solve) - sum(apply))/(4*nz*ny*nx)``; the S4-5 text said
      "~25", which was never the number.  The M2 seam's own four apply
      entries are what closed the gap: at the BASE commit a5b8d7e the
      same probe measures 23.11 (23.21 at the test configuration), and
      3*(nz + 1)*4 + 8 bytes per column against 4*nz is exactly the
      3.10-field difference).  The Thomas sweeps themselves hold their
      r/c'/d' arrays in per-thread registers/local memory (3x SASE_KMAX
      doubles per thread) -- NO global workspace, which is why no
      Thomas entry appears here.  S3-12 (the in-task pairing law): the
      additive dissipation channel's ONE new device field -- the
      state-independent Blackadar reference length
      (``launch_blackadar_length``), allocated after the 13-field drop
      and only under ``cfg.sase_additive_dissipation`` -- is
      transcribed unconditionally as the covering-superset entry
      ``lb_ref``, exactly the taper_g idiom; the solve phase keeps
      dominating (~20-field margin) so neither the category bound nor
      the byte pin moves.  The post-step scalar phase (kv + km_h
      held + 2 horizontal flux + 4 mixed rates + the coupled set)
      stays far below the solve bound.

    The category bound is the MAXIMUM over phases (the
    :func:`rrtmgp_workspace_phases` idiom); ``solve`` always dominates.
    The solve-internal (nz,) coefficient packs of its uniform-dz strain
    calls remain de-minimis and untranscribed, exactly as before.

    """Disjoint-lifetime arena aliases admitted by the reviewed audit.

    FORCE occurs between complete domain steps.  All three RK backings are
    dead after the preceding STEP and overwritten before their next stage
    read.  Parent and child coupled fields are simultaneously live, so the
    alias assignment below admits them only onto two distinct capacity-safe
    RK backings.  Preference order preserves F16's historical parent->rk_ru,
    child->rk_ww addresses on ordinary production grids; an explicit logical
    backing remains when no safe pair exists.

    Sixth-order diffusion itself processes targets serially.  On a diff6-only
    configuration x/y/m can all reuse the largest z backing.  The combined
    Smagorinsky path also borrows x/y, and needs both face buffers
    simultaneously for momentum staging and scalar fluxes.  If any domain
    enables km_opt=4, x and y therefore remain distinct while x/m may still
    reuse z.

    Smagorinsky K_m/K_h are consumed only while the pre-RK preparation builds
    the held mixing tendencies.  Each stage later prepares acoustic alpha and
    gamma from scratch before its first acoustic read, and no stage reads K.
    The two mass-point K arrays can therefore borrow prefixes of those two
    independent full-level coefficient backings.

# Preprocessing (ingest) phase
#
# Everything above prices the FORECAST.  For a long time that was the only
# phase anybody priced, and on a measured 414x330x49 CONUS 12 km case the
# forecast peaked at 7.10 GiB while preprocessing the very same case peaked
# at 14.94 GiB -- so `woof check` reported an envelope for a phase that
# was not the binding one, and a domain sized to a 12 GB card downloaded
# 81 GFS files and then died in preprocessing at 15.82 GB.  Ingest is now
# streamed (woof/ingest/lateral_bc.py:StateBoundaryFrames), and the model
# below is what it actually holds.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: Forcing times a streaming ingest holds on the device at once: the ONE
#: currently being built.  Every other time contributes its perimeter
#: frames -- host memory, O(perimeter) -- and is released before the next
#: one is interpolated.
#:
#: THIS WAS 2, AND THE SECOND ONE WAS THE START TIME.  Nothing reads the
#: start time until the boundaries are complete (the prepared cache, the
#: wrfinput export and the surface analysis are all written from it after
#: the loop), but a prepare loop that walked the times in order built it
#: FIRST and therefore held it while every later time was built
#: underneath.  The domain-tree (hierarchy) preparations and the
#: single-domain ERA5 preparation with a water-temperature overlay build it
#: LAST (woof/ingest/lateral_bc.py:start_last_forcing_order) and retain
#: nothing else, which is a pure reordering: the perimeter frames are
#: accumulated against their positions and the intervals come out
#: byte-identical.  At 800x800x49, mp=10, three GFS times, that is 14.67
#: GiB of device residency dropping to 7.66 and a peak envelope of 23.92
#: GiB dropping to 15.86 -- the whole reason such a domain can be
#: prepared on a 16 GiB card at all.
#:
#: Every other single domain is now prepared START FIRST again, and still
#: holds one: the start time is written into the prepared head and
#: released before the next time is built (woof/ingest/boundary_stream.py,
#: chained preparation), so what it held under every later build is gone.
#: Its forecast may run beside the producer; the producer holds one
#: forcing time on its own device while it does, and
#: ``boundary_stream.chained_admission`` admits the pair only when the
#: forecast's estimate plus that one time fits the card, and
#: ``boundary_stream.host_admission`` only when host RAM holds the forecast
#: process, its head and its whole boundary series beside the producer.
#:
#: SCOPE, because this number is a gate input and an optimistic gate is
#: the failure mode this section exists to prevent: it describes the
#: prepared-cache adapters `woof/gfs_direct.py`, `woof/era5_direct.py`
#: and `woof/mapped_direct.py`, which are what `woof go` and the domain
#: wizard price.  `woof/runtime.py:prepare_real_case` -- the verify-case
#: preparer, off those routes -- has not been reordered and still holds
#: two, so for a run prepared through THAT path this estimate is
#: optimistic by exactly one `per_time_bytes`.

#: Pressure levels each forcing product decodes onto the target grid.
#: GFS: the certified 21-level ladder the Rust bridge gates on

#: :func:`source_analysis_levels` counts those for it.
#: ERA5: the 37 standard pressure levels of the reanalysis product.
#:
#: This map IS the priced-source inventory: a product absent from it is

#: Single-level fields interpolated alongside them (surface state, skin,
#: snow, ice, land mask and the four soil moisture/temperature layers).
#: ERA5 includes the three explicit lake-state fields in the current CDS
#: request. These nominal counts apply only before an actual decoded catalog
#: supplies its exact inventory; older/smaller inputs retain their own price.
SOURCE_ANALYSIS_SURFACE_FIELDS = {"era5": 23, "gfs": 19}

#: HOST bytes one decoded SOURCE field point occupies.  The GRIB1 bridge
#: dump is float64 (`woof/ingest/grib.py:550`, ``np.fromfile(...,

#: narrower on both its axes and its fields (`grib.py:220-221`,
#: `:237-238`), so nothing on this road is ever taken to float32.  This is
#: the source grid, not the target: horizontal interpolation happens
#: after the decode, so the bytes below are charged on the file's mesh.
INGEST_HOST_DECODE_BYTES_PER_POINT = 8

#: How many times the decode of ONE forcing time is held in host memory
#: SIMULTANEOUSLY, which is the number an out-of-memory kill turns on.
#: The window is preparation: both copies exist from the decode until
#: ``woof.ingest.grib.clear_forcing_caches`` runs, which is the moment
#: the root's case is prepared, and one of them -- the input catalog's
#: own frozen tuple, which a nest re-ingests from -- outlives that for
#: the run.  A command that only decodes and never prepares (``woof
#: check`` itself) holds both until it exits.
#:
#: KEYED BY SOURCE, and it prices ONE of them, because this is a property
#: of a DECODER and not of a product.  ERA5 is the native-GRIB1 route
#: through :mod:`woof.ingest.grib`, which is the road that retains; GFS
#: and HRRR feed the rw-wps/gpuwm-wrf-init front door, whose host
#: behaviour nothing here has measured.  A source absent from this map is
#: reported NOT PRICED rather than given this road's number -- the same
#: convention :data:`SOURCE_ANALYSIS_LEVELS` states one table up.
#:
#: TWO, and both are named.  (1) The decoder's own arrays, reached through
#: ``@lru_cache(maxsize=8) _decode_era5_forcing_partials_resolved``
#: (`woof/ingest/grib.py:934`).  (2) The frozen snapshot's, because
#: :meth:`Era5Snapshot.__post_init__` COPIES every axis and every field
#: (`grib.py:226`, `:251`) and the result is reached through a second
#: ``@lru_cache(maxsize=8)``, ``_decode_era5_gribs_resolved``
#: (`grib.py:958`).  The two byte sets are disjoint and neither cache
#: evicts on size: ``maxsize`` counts ENTRIES, and one entry is a whole
#: forcing window.
#:
#: A FLOOR, AND THE REPORT SAYS SO.  Two terms this deliberately does not
#: claim, because both are conditional on facts the estimator cannot see
#: without performing the decode it exists to price:
#:   * the flat bridge buffer.  ``_load_bridge_partials`` reads the whole
#:     dump into one array (`grib.py:550`), stacks the pressure levels
#:     into new cubes (`:604-607`) but keeps every SURFACE field as a VIEW
#:     into that buffer (`:565`, `:573`).  A live view pins the whole
#:     allocation, so a file carrying both pressure and surface records
#:     retains one more copy of itself; separate CDS pressure/single-level
#:     downloads -- the split `build_input_catalog` tells users to make --
#:     free the pressure file's buffer after the stack and do not.
#:   * a second merged copy.  A run reaches the module twice for one
#:     product, under catalog discovery and again under the catalog's time
#:     selection, and those are different cache keys.
#: Understating is the correct direction here: this figure gates a
#: REFUSAL, and a refusal must never fire on a run that would have
#: completed.

    host-store tiling declarations; that route retains its host itemization
    and consumes no GPU memory during preparation. Explicit CUDA/auto and
    other source contracts retain the existing device envelope.

    ``machine`` is only consulted for ``mode = "auto"`` with no pinned

    """THE estimate a tree's ``[tiles]`` admission is judged from.

    ONE function, called with the same arguments wherever the question is
    asked, because the question has one answer.  The plan review
    (:func:`estimate_phases`, through
    :func:`woof.core.streaming.tree_road_plan`) and the run door
    (:func:`woof.core.streaming.cold_tree_streaming_decision`)
    used to price it from two different calls: the review with an explicit
    ``column_chunk`` and the target card's profile, the door with the
    prepared cache's retained forcing interval count and its real lateral
    boundaries and no profile at all.  MEASURED on the 12/3 km moving-nest
    cyclone tree, those two inputs move the envelope by 60,193,971 and by
    up to 432,788,799 bytes, so for any budget in between the review
    admitted the tree resident and the door then raised ``StreamingRefused``
    AFTER authority, fetch, manifest and prepare had run -- a refusal the
    user paid for twice over and could have had before the download.

    So the admission is priced from the CONFIGURATION and the machine, and
    from nothing a cold surface cannot see: ``column_chunk`` is the
    experiment's own, the forcing schedule is the one the configuration
    declares, and no lateral boundary SET is folded in.  The run keeps
    its own, richer estimate for its memory LEDGER -- that one has the
    cache's real interval count and belongs to a different question -- and
    the two are never compared against each other.

    THE MACHINE IS THE ONLY DEVICE TERM, AND THERE IS NO SECOND WAY IN.
    This used to take a ``profile`` as well, defaulting to the machine's,
    and that optional second way in was a third estimate rather than a
    convenience: the review passed its own profile while the door passed
    none and took ``machine.device_profile``, so the very argument
    asymmetry this function was written to close reopened one field
    lower.  MEASURED on one card, the same tree and the same budget:
    4,009,919,677 bytes on a detect-built profile, 4,271,801,533 on a
    probe-built one carrying the measured bare context and compile
    platform, 5,141,378,237 on none -- and for any budget between two of
    those, one side admits what the other refuses.  So the device comes
    from the machine, every caller passes the machine its own surface
    already holds (:func:`woof.core.streaming.planner_machine` now
    carries the profile for the review surfaces, and
    :meth:`tilestream.autoplan.Machine.detect` has always carried it for
    the door), and the same card gives the same envelope on both sides.

    THE SOURCE IS PART OF THE CONFIGURATION'S TABLES.  The root's forcing
    tables at the declared schedule are priced, and they carry the
    analysed hydrometeors the forcing source publishes
    (:func:`woof.boundary_fields.source_boundary_species`, read off its
    table row, off the mapping document a mapped route passes as
    ``source``, or off the masses a prepared door's cache carries, which
    that door passes instead of its source's name).  Priced without it, a
    HRRR-forced tiled, streamed or resident-admitted run was weighed
    against the card short by those tables while :func:`estimate_phases`
    priced them, so the review and the door answered two different
    envelopes again.  ``None`` (a source
    the caller does not know, or one that publishes none) prices water
    vapour only, which is what such a run holds.

    #: exit 1, the one configuration class streaming exists to enable.
    #: Measured on the 550x550x49 / 200x200 fixture: 11.35 GiB of resident
    #: pool request weighed against a budget the 6.71 GiB streamed run fits
    #: with room to spare.
    #:
    #: COMPARED AS AN ENVELOPE, AGAINST THE ENVELOPE BUDGET, and that pair
    #: is the decision rather than a convenience.
    #: :attr:`StreamedEnvelope.vram_bytes` is envelope-shaped by
    #: construction -- CUDA context, the rung's per-process fixed cost and
    #: the tile buffers, with autoplan's safety factor -- and there is no
    #: alloc-shaped figure to be had from it.  ``Footprint`` lumps the
    #: pool-resident k-distribution tables in with the non-pool module
    #: images inside one measured ``process_fixed_bytes``, so any
    #: subtraction that made it alloc-shaped would be inventing a number.
    #: Both candidate subtractions were priced on this fixture and both
    #: are wrong in a way that matters: taking off the whole
    #: ``process_overhead_bytes`` leaves 2.95 GiB against a run that really
    #: holds 6.71, an UNDER-charge of 1.31 GiB that would have the gate
    #: admit an OOM; taking off only the CUDA context leaves 6.29 GiB and
    #: charges the 2.03 GiB local-memory backing store a second time, on
    #: top of the reserve that already holds it -- the task-206 double
    #: count this file spent a release removing.
    #:
    #: So the streamed figure is compared against ``envelope_budget``
    #: (free VRAM less the other-process margin), which is the same pair
    #: ``woof go``'s memory gate admits on and the same pair the
    #: over-budget WARNING below prints.  The leg's contract --
    #: "the estimate fits the budget" -- is unchanged; what it prices is.
    #:
    #: ``--alloc`` is excluded on purpose: ``run_alloc_preflight``
    #: constructs the RESIDENT domain on the real card, so its measured
    #: legs describe a resident allocation, and swapping the estimate leg
    #: underneath them would have ``alloc_measured_le_estimate`` compare a
