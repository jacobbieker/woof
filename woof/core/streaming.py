"""Out-of-core streaming as a MODE OF ARWEN, not a parallel universe.

:mod:`tilestream` can integrate a domain that does not fit on the card: the
full domain lives in pinned host RAM and tiles of it are cycled through the
GPU, bit-exact against a resident run.  Every one of those results was
produced by ``tilestream``'s own stepping loop.  WOOF's real driver --
:mod:`woof.core.model` for a domain tree, :func:`woof.runtime
.integrate_prepared_case` for a single domain -- knew nothing about any of
it, which meant a user could not turn it on.  This module is the seam that
makes it a configuration rather than a research branch.

THE SEAM IS ONE CALLABLE
------------------------
Both run loops step a domain by calling ``dycore.step(state, cfg, **kw)``.
:func:`make_stepper` returns the callable they call instead.  With streaming
OFF it returns ``woof.core.dycore.step`` ITSELF -- the same function object,
not a wrapper that forwards to it -- so there is no "streaming disabled" code
path to be wrong: the identity ``make_stepper(...) is dycore.step`` is what
the OFF contract means, and it is asserted rather than described
(``tests/test_streaming.py::test_off_returns_the_dycore_step_itself``).

With streaming ON it returns a :class:`StreamedDomain`, whose ``__call__``
has ``dycore.step``'s signature and advances the whole domain by exactly one
model step per call, sweeping the tiles.  The MODEL still owns the loop: it
decides when output, restart, diagnostics, health validation and nest
coupling happen, on its own cadences, with its own handlers.  That is why
:class:`tilestream.driver.TiledRun` exists -- ``run_tiled`` owned a time loop
of its own, and a mode that owns the time loop can only ever sit beside the
model, never inside it.

WHAT "AUTO" DECIDES, AND WHY IT IS NOT "ALWAYS ON"
-------------------------------------------------
Streaming is never free.  MEASURED tiling tax against the identical resident
run, dry, 4090, 1024^2 x 49, 150 steps: tile 128 -> 1.359x, tile 256 ->
1.217x, tile 512 -> 1.346x, and the compute window has to be at least ~500
cells on a side before the number means anything at all (below that the
measurement is of an idle GPU).  So ``mode = "auto"`` streams ONLY when the
domain does not fit resident, and the fitting question is answered by
:mod:`tilestream.autoplan`, whose VRAM model was fitted against 29 measured
allocations on two cards and is a tight upper bound (measured 1.060x /
1.095x of the real allocation).  ``mode = "on"`` streams a domain that would
have fitted, which is what a benchmark or a bit-exactness proof needs and
what a forecast does not.

THREE THINGS A STREAMED DOMAIN MUST CARRY, EACH OF WHICH HAS BEEN A BUG
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
*Geography is INPUT.*  Map factors, Coriolis, rotation, terrain, the
terrain-following base state and every scheme's latitude/longitude grid are
gathered into a buffer when that buffer starts serving a different tile, and
never scattered back: measured bit-identical across 8 steps at the
229-carrier rung.  Rebuilding them per tile from the tile's own config
displaces a tile by up to 1022 km and 20.6% in Coriolis.

*The clock is a carrier.*  ``dycore.step`` advances ``elapsed_seconds`` once
per CALL and ``PhysicsDriver`` turns it into the ``itimestep`` that every
cadence test reads, and ``lateral_bc`` turns it into ``dtbc``.  A buffer
serving k tiles would advance k*dt while the domain advanced dt, so tiles
inside one sweep would disagree about whether radiation, cumulus or the PBL
was due and would integrate different physics -- with no NaN and no warning.
Dropping it changed 874,076 cells; at the 229-carrier rung it moves 153 of
them.  So the buffer's clock is reset to the domain's before every tile step
and the domain's advances exactly once per sweep.

*Lateral boundaries are per tile.*  A tile's TRUE domain edges take the
domain's own tables sliced along the tangential axis; its interior seams take
inert tables.  MEASURED, and this is the fact the mode rests on: seam tables
of zeros, seam tables holding the domain's own coupled values with zero
tendency, and seam tables of deliberate garbage (1e6 in coupled units, 1e4/s
of tendency) all give the BIT-IDENTICAL answer out to 24 steps at the halo
``harness.halo_radius`` prescribes.  The seam relaxation cannot reach the
interior, because it perturbs the RK TENDENCY rather than the state and a
tendency injected at stage 0 is advected by fewer stages than a state
perturbation present at the start of the step -- its cone is strictly inside
the dycore's own.

WHERE A HISTORY FRAME COMES FROM, AND WHY THE ANSWER MOVED
-----------------------------------------------------------
``attach`` COPIES the domain's carriers into the store and the sweep
advances the store; the resident ``DomainState`` it was built from is never
written again.  WOOF's three history call sites -- ``runtime
.write_case_output``, ``runtime._submit_tree_history_frame`` and
``prepared_single_domain_forecast``'s ``history_handler`` -- all read that
state, so a streamed run published a full forecast's worth of frames holding
the INITIAL CONDITION, each with the right inventory, the right ``Times``
and the right global attributes.  Nothing raised.

So :class:`StreamedDomain` marks the state it took over
(``state._streamed_domain``), :meth:`StreamedDomain.history_fields` serves
the frame off the store through :class:`tilestream.output.StoreFrame`, and
``AsyncDomainWrfoutWriter.submit`` grew a ``frame=`` parameter so a frame
that is already on the host is published with no device traffic at all.
MEASURED, ``tilestream.test_history``: five frames -- the cold-start frame
plus four history frames -- per-variable AND whole-file SHA-256 identical to
the resident run at every rung, REFL_10CM included.

REFL_10CM is the one field that needed more than transport, and it needed
two things: the sweep was DROPPING ``step_kwargs`` (so no tile ever ran
``calc_refl10cm``), and the model's one-frame handoff refuses to be
overwritten, which fires on the second tile a buffer serves.  See
:func:`refl_handoff_hook`.

THE HALO IS NEVER MEASURED
--------------------------
It is ``10 + 3*time_step_sound//2`` (:func:`tilestream.harness.halo_radius`)
and nothing else.  A too-small halo is silent AND faster, which is how it
hides; the smallest halo that happens to pass grows with step count, shrinks
with test-domain size and differs by GPU.

That last clause is not a hedge, it is a measurement, and the two halves of
it were taken on the SAME MACHINE.  On the joined configuration at
256x192x49, tile 32x32, N=8, the join lane found halo 15 passing and halo 14
failing on one 4090; ``tilestream/test_join.py`` finds halo 14 passing and
halo 13 failing on the other 4090 of the same dual-GPU box.  Same code, same
config, same card model, margin off by one.  Anything that took its halo
from a sweep would have shipped a number that is wrong on the neighbouring
socket -- which is why the gate's halo CONTROL is half the dependency
radius, a value the dependency argument says cannot work, and why the
margin is printed as data and never asserted.

        :mod:`tilestream.autoplan` for it.  NEVER benchmark below a ~500-cell
        compute window: at 224^2 the tiling tax is 5.37x and what is being

        Present so that a deliberately broken halo can be configured for a
        negative control, and for NO other reason.  ``None`` -- the only
        value a forecast may use -- takes it from
        :func:`tilestream.harness.halo_radius`.  A halo below that radius is
        silently wrong and faster, so this key warns when it is set.

    ``store``
        ``"host"`` (pinned host RAM; the out-of-core mode) or ``"device"``
        (the domain store stays in VRAM and only the STEPPING is tiled).
        The device store exists because it isolates the tiling arithmetic
        from the transport: if a run is bit-exact with a device store and
        wrong with a host store, the defect is in the copies, not the tiles.

    ``write_mode``
        ``"ring"`` keeps ONE domain store plus a small arena of halo rings;
        ``"shadow"`` keeps a whole second store.  Ring is the default because
        the host store is the binding constraint at every capacity limit
        measured: at 32.26 B/cell dry against a 44.14 GiB pinned ceiling a
        single store holds 5476^2 x 49 and a shadow pair only 3872^2.  Rings
        are cheap only when the tile DIVIDES the domain -- a ragged trailing
        tile is read right through, 22.7% of the store instead of 2.4% in one
        measured case -- which is why the planner prefers exact tilings.

    ``vram_budget_bytes`` / ``host_budget_bytes``
        Override what :func:`tilestream.autoplan.Machine.detect` found.
        ``/proc/meminfo`` reports the HOST's RAM inside a container and is
        not a budget.  ``host_budget_bytes`` is read BEFORE the machine is
        probed and supplies the host figure to the probe, so it stands in

    The tile road cannot save a near miss: the streamed process pays the

    what the card measured free (``card_bytes``, before the external margin
    the admission budget keeps back for other programs): run resident,
    inside that margin, and say so -- the same call ``woof go`` makes for

class StreamedEnvelope:
    """What a STREAMED forecast of one domain actually holds, priced.

    The number the admission gate needs and did not have.  Every memory
    term ``woof.core.preflight`` computes itemizes a domain resident in
    VRAM, so with ``[tiles]`` configured the gate was answering a question
    nobody asked: MEASURED at the 2.2.0 cut, a 550x550x49 run with 200x200
    tiles -- the exact shape streaming exists for -- was refused by
    ``woof go`` at "15.36 GiB peak envelope exceeds the 13.09 GiB budget"
    on a card with 15.24 GiB free, and the remedy printed was
    ``--no-memory-gate``.  A feature whose only configuration is refused by
    default is not shipped, so the gate learns the streamed envelope here.

    Built from :class:`tilestream.autoplan.Footprint` -- the same measured
    model ``autoplan.plan`` sizes tiles with and the same one ``decide``
    consults -- so the gate and the run cannot give two answers about one
    card.  ``vram_bytes`` is the whole streamed process: CUDA context, the
    rung's per-process fixed cost, and ``nbuffers`` tile buffers of the
    COMPUTE WINDOW (tile plus halo on both axes), with autoplan's safety
    factor already applied.  ``host_bytes`` is everything the streamed
    forecast holds in host RAM that this model prices: the pinned store
    plus the ring arena, which is where the domain actually lives, plus
    the domain's own lateral forcing series (``boundary_table_bytes``,
    ordinary host memory), which every tile's edge is cut from.
    :attr:`pinned_bytes` is the page-locked part alone.

    THE FORCING SERIES IS PRICED BECAUSE IT WAS NOT, and the run showed what
    unpriced host memory costs: the estimate said 0.93 GiB while the tile
    tables grew to 27.7 GB at 1,190 tiles and to 125 GB committed on a 96 GB
    box.  The per-tile half of that is gone (tiles are windowed on demand,
    as views -- :func:`tile_boundary_tables`); the series every window is
    cut from stays for the whole run and is counted here.

    TWO VRAM FIGURES, BECAUSE THE CARD MEETS TWO.  ``vram_bytes`` is what
    the process HOLDS between radiation calls, which is the figure an NVML
    steady-state reading can be compared against.
    ``radiation_transient_bytes`` is the RRTMGP call's per-process working
    set -- MEASURED at +2.74 GiB over steady state, allocated, used and
    freed inside one call, recurring every radiation period and lasting
    60-75 s of it (:data:`tilestream.autoplan.RADIATION_TRANSIENT_BYTES`
    carries the measurement and its provenance; the rungs that run no
    radiation carry zero).  :attr:`peak_vram_bytes` is their sum, and it is
    the figure every ADMISSION question has to be asked of: a card that
    holds the first and not the second admits the run, downloads the
    forcing, prepares the domain and meets the transient at the first
    radiation call, which is ``itimestep == 1``.

    PRICED AT THE WINDOW'S OWN SHAPE (2.7.3).  ``vram_bytes`` is what
    ``nbuffers`` buffers of exactly ``window_nx x window_ny`` cost, on both
    roads: the pinned tiling's window is known from ``[tiles]`` and the
    planner's from the tile it chose.  It used to be priced through a
    cell-count-only bound whose sizing rectangle was ``N x 1`` -- see
    :mod:`woof.core.prepared_tile_memory` for the user's 572x524 icon-eu
    forecast that this priced at 38.96 GiB streamed against 17.43 GiB
    resident, 20.8 GiB of it forcing tables for a one-row rectangle no
    buffer ever holds.  ``terms`` carries the arithmetic behind
    ``vram_bytes``, named, so :meth:`terms_lines` can put it under a
    refusal and a screenshot of that refusal can be checked.

    ``[tiles]`` (the run itself, a report that prints the decision) prices
    the decision it will execute rather than re-deriving one that could
    differ.  Without it, :func:`decide` resolves the options -- and a

    which needs a ``machine``; pass one built from an out-of-process probe
    rather than letting ``Machine.detect`` stand a CUDA context up inside a
    long-lived CLI (the reason ``go_cli.memory_gate`` probes in a
    subprocess at all).

    ``forcing_interval_seconds`` / ``forcing_intervals`` size the domain's
    lateral forcing series the same way the resident estimate sizes its
    device tables (:func:`woof.core.preflight.lbc_intervals`); a caller
    that knows the schedule passes it, and one that does not gets the
    estimator's default cadence rather than a series priced at nothing.
    ``source`` is the forcing source, whose published hydrometeors ride
    that series (:func:`woof.core.preflight.lbc_host_series_bytes`).

    cyclone door its sizing snapshot's.  A DECLARED card -- ``--vram-gib``
    naming a box that is not this one -- has no measured profile to pass
    and gets the reference one, whose basis the report states as
    ``non_pool_basis`` rather than passing it off as a reading.

        field order is the device frame's own -- essential, because the
        frame dict doubles as the writer's schema and HDF5 lays its name
        heap out in variable-creation order (the same numbers in a different
        order give a file 189 bytes larger in which every variable compares
        equal).

        Lazy, because it allocates: the derived ``T`` and ``P`` need their
        own destinations, 2 x 4 B/cell, and a run that never writes a frame
        should not pay for them.  Everything else is a ZERO-COPY VIEW of the
        pinned store -- which is what makes an out-of-core frame 2.2x-2.4x
        cheaper than the resident path -- so the returned dict is only valid
        UNTIL THE NEXT SWEEP.  Take it at a sweep boundary and drain the
        writer before stepping on; that is the whole discipline and
        ``tilestream.test_history.negative_async_no_drain`` asserts what
        breaking it does.

        Raises rather than guesses if the store cannot serve the frame: a
        run whose ``inventory_fn`` carries only the trajectory's carriers
        cannot publish the output-only driver diagnostics (``OLR``, and
        ``XKMH``/``XKHH`` under ``hmix_k_diag``), and a frame missing rows a
        resident run writes is not the same frame.

        THAT RAISE IS REAL AS OF 2.2.0 AND WAS NOT BEFORE.  Until then this
        docstring described an intention: ``StoreFrame.fields`` skipped the
        unavailable rows and the writer took the short dict as its schema,
        so the sentence above was true of the design and false of the
        behaviour -- a streamed run published a frame without ``OLR`` and
        reported validity PASS.  :class:`tilestream.output.ShortFrameRefused`
        is the refusal, :func:`diagnostic_inventory` is the reason it no
        longer fires on the product route, and
        ``tests/test_streamed_frame_parity.py`` is what keeps the two
        accurate by comparing the streamed and resident FIELD SETS rather
        than trusting either description.

        TWO ROADS TO THE PLAN, ONE FRAME.  With a prepared resident state the
        plan is measured against that state directly, which is what every
        streamed run has always done.  A STORE-DIRECT domain has no such
        object -- and above the card's ceiling cannot have one -- so the plan
        is measured against the slab-height :attr:`template` and re-sized onto
        the store by :func:`tilestream.output.store_frame_plan`; the setup
        statics come from the DOMAIN geography rather than from the slab's
        window of it (:meth:`output_setup`).  Neither substitution is a
        different frame: the classification is a question about schemes and
        the statics are the domain's own arrays, and the gate is that a domain
        small enough to run both ways publishes byte-identical files.

        With ``store = "host"`` -- the out-of-core mode, and the only one
        worth having -- the forecast lives in pinned host RAM and the
        ``DomainState`` the route is holding is the SNAPSHOT that filled the
        store.  Nothing writes back to it.  MEASURED, 192x144x49 at the
        155-carrier rung through ``execute_experiment``: after 120 streamed
        steps, 0 of 155 carriers on ``node.state`` had moved, against 118 of
        155 for the identical resident run.

        That matters because ``node.state`` is what everything AROUND the
        stepper reads.  ``execute_experiment`` hands it to the health
        validators; ``prepared_single_domain_forecast`` reads it for every
        history frame, for the stability gate and for the final
        ``canonical_state_digest``.  Left alone, a streamed forecast writes
        the INITIAL CONDITION into every wrfout it publishes and passes
        every health check by inspecting a state that never integrated --
        which is worse than the refusal this mode used to give, because it
        looks like a forecast.

        So a route that reads the state must call this first.  It is a
        D2H/H2D of the whole carrier set, so it belongs on the HISTORY
        cadence and at the end of the run, never per step: at 229 B/cell it
        is one domain-sized copy, which is what one history frame already
        costs.  Returns the number of members copied -- the carrier set
        plus the scattered ``diag/*`` producers below -- so a caller can
        assert it moved the whole manifest rather than a lucky subset.

        The ``diag/*`` members ride along (task #219, second finding).
        Output-only driver diagnostics -- ``OLR`` at every shipped rung,
        the eddy-viscosity pair under ``cfg.hmix_k_diag``, the SASE flux
        rows under SASE -- are correctly absent from the carrier manifest
        (nothing reads them back into the trajectory), but the sweep
        gathers and scatters them into the store precisely so they can be
        published.  A refresh that moved only carriers left the DRIVER's
        copies at the snapshot's zeros, so every route that publishes
        frames off the state (``woof.io.wrfout.state_frame``; the offline
        child) emitted OLR = 0 for the whole forecast while the store held
        the sky the tiles computed -- MEASURED: streamed OLR max 0.0

    THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR
    --------------------------
    :func:`woof.runtime.integrate_prepared_case` guards a forecast with
    three whole-domain observers and hands all three the prepared
    ``DomainState``::

        report = stability_report(state, integration_cfg, boundary_width=w)
        health.require_healthy(phase=...)
        step_swdown_peak = float(cp.max(state.physics.fields["swdown"]))

    Under ``store = "host"`` that state is a copy taken at t=0 --
    :func:`attach` fills the store with ``gather.pinned_copy``, which COPIES
    -- and no sweep ever writes it again.  So the NaN guard never fires, the
    w_max monitor freezes at its initial value, and a domain that went
    non-finite in the store completes "successfully" and writes a checkpoint
    whose ``run_trackers`` record ``nan_free: true``.  The observers are pure
    (they carry nothing into the answer), which is exactly why nothing caught
    it, and the reduction still RUNS every substep -- so the mode was paying
    a real GPU tax for an answer that was wrong.

    WHY A FOLD IS THE ANSWER AND A RESIDENT MIRROR IS NOT
    -----------------------------------------------------
    Refreshing the ``DomainState`` from the store would mean holding the
    whole domain on the card, which is the one thing the mode exists to
    avoid.  There is no resident copy to keep current, so every whole-domain
    observer either becomes a fold or stops being armed -- and this one folds
    cleanly, because ``stability_report`` is a max/OR reduction and tile
    interiors PARTITION the domain (``tilestream.spec.validate_plan``).

    One record per tile, emitted by ``health_partial_tile`` after that
    tile's step and before its interior is scattered back, folded by
    ``health.cu``'s own ``health_final`` and decoded by
    :func:`woof.core.dycore.decode_stability_record` -- the same decoder the
    resident path uses, deliberately not a copy of it.  The result is
    bit-identical to the monolithic reduction, not approximately equal: max
    is associative and exact, the NaN classes are a bitwise OR, and the
    argmax carries a DOMAIN flat index so the "lowest index wins ties" rule
    resolves the same way whatever order the tiles were swept in.

    COST
    ----
    The reduction moves from once per substep over the whole domain to once
    per TILE over that tile's interior, so it reads the same number of cells
    per substep -- but on data that is already resident, issued into the
    tile's own stream with no readback, and the single eight-word host copy
    happens once per model step instead of once per substep.

    wide, ``v``'s west/east tables are ``cny+1`` tall).  East and north
    tables are stored outermost-first, so the same tangential slice is
    correct for them and no reversal is needed.

    A side that is an INTERIOR SEAM gets tables that are INERT, and the whole
    mode rests on the measurement that says they may be:

    ``"zeros"``
        value and tendency both zero.  Cheap, deterministic, and obviously
        not the domain's data, so a seam that reached the interior would show.

    ``"self"``
        the domain's own coupled values at that seam (from ``snapshot``,
        windowed to the tile) with zero tendency -- the self-consistent case,
        physically the most defensible and numerically a completely different
        set of numbers from zeros.

    ``"poison"``
        deliberate garbage: 1e6 in coupled units (roughly 500x a real coupled
        wind) and 1e4/s of tendency.  This is the sharp form of the control.
        Zeros and self-consistent are both plausible, and a cone that reached
        the interior only weakly might survive both; garbage would not.

    MEASURED at 256x192x49, tile 32x32, real Lambert + real terrain +
    specified BCs, halo 16 from ``harness.halo_radius``: all three give the
    BIT-IDENTICAL answer, out to N=24.  The controls that must fire do --
    tables not windowed at all, and true-edge tables scaled by 1.000001,
    both move all nine dry carriers.

    Why the seam cannot reach the interior, given that the halo is only the
    dycore's own dependency radius: the seam forcing perturbs the RK
    TENDENCY, not the state, and a tendency injected at stage 0 is advected
    by fewer stages than a state perturbation present at the start of the
    step, so its cone is strictly inside the dycore's.  The prediction that
    ``halo >= halo_radius + spec_bdy_width`` would be needed is REFUTED: the
    smallest passing halo is 15, one cell BELOW the dycore radius, not five
    above it.

    NOTHING IS COPIED ON THE PRODUCTION SEAM.  A true edge is a VIEW of the
    domain's own (immutable) table, and a ``"zeros"`` seam is
    :func:`woof.ingest.lateral_bc.inert_boundary_table`, a zero-stride view
    of one shared zero.  A window used to be a float64 copy and every seam
    real zeros, for every tile, interval, field and side, which is host
    memory proportional to tile count: 27.7 GB at 1,190 tiles, and 125 GB
    committed on a 96 GB box against a 0.93 GiB estimate.  The numbers that
    reach the card are the same ones: the reload converts the view to

    LAZILY, which is a measured fix and not a preference.  The eager
    ``attach_lateral_boundaries`` re-validates, re-packs and re-uploads
    EVERY forcing interval on every buffer-tile change: 27-63 ms per bind
    on a real tile buffer, host-blocking, growing with interval count, tile
    count and boundary size -- ~0.3 s/step at the attribution run's largest
    arm, all of it serialised into the sweep
    (``tilestream/OVERLAP-ATTRIBUTION.md``).  The streaming attachment
    (``attach_streaming_lateral_boundaries``) allocates ONE packed device
    slot per buffer, sized for a single interval; every later bind swaps
    the host tables and invalidates the resident interval id, so the next
    specified-boundary launch reloads that same slot -- measured at
    ~0.01 ms.  Same numbers on the card either way: the reload runs the
    identical float64 -> float32 conversion the eager upload runs, and
    :func:`tilestream.realcase.tile_boundary_binder` -- this hook's twin,
    from which the swap discipline is taken verbatim -- carries the digest
    proof.

    The FIRST bind per buffer converts that buffer from whatever attachment
    its factory gave it (the production factory attaches tile 0's tables
    eagerly so the warmup step can run) to the streaming attachment;
    conversion releases the eager scratch.  A later bind that finds the
    streaming attachment gone refuses: something re-attached behind the
    hook's back, and swapping tables under an eager attachment would leave
    the device serving the OLD tile's forcing with no error anywhere.

    ``domain_state`` is the DOMAIN's own prepared state, and it is here to
    carry the Davies CLOCK BINDING onto every buffer (task #219).  Every
    production driver-forced root binds a ``DomainClock`` to its external
    LBC mirror (``bind_lateral_boundary_clock``), which switches Davies
    consumers to WRF's post-increment ``dtbc`` recurrence (``dt..T_bdy``).
    The buffers this hook converts start with NO binding -- their factory
    attachment never had one -- so without the rebind below every tile
    step fell back to the retired ``elapsed - interval.start`` path
    (``0..T-dt``) and a streamed domain consumed its lateral boundaries
    ONE TIMESTEP LATE whenever the production clock was bound.  MEASURED
    on the offline child at t+15 min: 41 of 76 wrfout fields differed, W
    by 0.0043 m/s on a 0.174 m/s field, a constant one-step phase error.
    The clock is read LAZILY, at first bind, because binding order is a
    route decision this module must not constrain; a domain with no bound
    clock binds nothing and the buffers keep the compatibility semantics,
    which is what keeps the legacy direct routes bit-for-bit.

    ``external_clock`` IS THE POLICY, and it exists because lazy derivation
    was the wrong abstraction for a domain that never had a state.
    ``DERIVE_CLOCK`` (the default) is the behaviour above: read the binding
    off ``domain_state`` at first bind, which is right for a re-attached
    resident domain and is what keeps the legacy direct routes bit-exact.
    A ``DomainClock`` binds THAT clock unconditionally and needs no state.
    ``None`` selects legacy elapsed-seconds compatibility EXPLICITLY.

    The distinction is not decorative.  ``store_domain_builder`` attaches
    with no state at all, so ``domain_state`` is ``None``, ``domain_clock()``
    returned ``None``, and ``converted[id(tile_state)]`` latched on the first
    bind and was never revisited -- so every buffer of a store-direct
    forecast took ``elapsed - interval.start`` (``0..T-dt``) while its
    resident twin took ``dtbc`` (``dt..T_bdy``).  That is the #219 one-step
    phase error, on the road the LARGEST domains take and the one least
    likely to have a resident control beside it.  Deriving nothing from
    nothing cannot be distinguished from deciding to derive nothing, so the
    decision is made a parameter and the store-direct road passes the node's
    own clock.

    And it is checked PER LAUNCH, not only at conversion: a buffer whose
    bound clock is not the expected object is refused rather than stepped.
    A latch that is set once and trusted forever is exactly how the first
    defect survived a gate.

    own window of it correctly and the transport throws every one away, so
    the buffer ends a sweep holding the LAST tile's window and the domain
    has no copy at all.  ``OLR`` is that row at every shipped rung;
    ``XKMH``/``XKHH`` join it under ``cfg.hmix_k_diag`` and the SASE flux
    rows under SASE.

    Listing them here makes the ordinary gather/scatter carry them, which
    :func:`tilestream.output.diagnostic_inventory` measured bit-exact
    against a monolithic run (``tilestream.test_io.
    case_diagnostic_scatter``, which asserts the negative too: without the
    scatter the published field is wrong over ``(tiles-1)/tiles`` of the
    domain).  They do NOT become carriers by being listed -- nothing reads
    them back into the trajectory, so a run that carries them integrates
    the identical forecast.  The price is what :func:`tilestream.output.
    scatter_cost` prints: 0.082 B/cell for ``OLR``, 8 B/cell for the
    eddy-viscosity pair.

    WHY THIS WRAPS RATHER THAN REPLACING ``output.diagnostic_inventory``:
    that function composes over ``carrier_manifest`` and this route's base
    is ``streaming_inventory`` (the RESTART manifest, which is the wider
    set -- see :func:`attach`).  Composing keeps one naming, one table and
    one place where a new output-only attribute has to be declared.

    Never allocates, exactly as :func:`refl_inventory` never does:
    :func:`prime_lazy_carriers` is what creates a producer slot, and a slot
    that is genuinely absent stays absent so
    :class:`tilestream.output.ShortFrameRefused` can still fire at the
    first frame rather than a plausible array of zeros being published for
    the whole run.

    ``state`` is the prepared, resident :class:`~woof.core.state.DomainState`
    -- the one WOOF's preparation built and the one the health validator,
    the output writer and the restart writer already know about.  Its
    carriers are copied into the store; with ``decision.store == "host"``
    that store is pinned host RAM, which is the point.

    ``store`` is the other road, and it exists because the first one caps the
    domain at the size of the card rather than at the size of the machine.
    Pass an already-built full-domain carrier store -- as
    :func:`woof.ingest.prepared_store.store_from_prepared_cache` builds one,
    slab by slab, with no domain-shaped device array anywhere -- and nothing
    is copied off a resident state because there is no resident state to copy
    off.  ``state`` may then be ``None``, and ``scalars`` must be given
    explicitly since there is nothing to read them from.  Everything
    downstream is unchanged: :class:`tilestream.driver.TiledRun` has always
    taken a bare ``{carrier key: array}`` dict and never touched a
    ``DomainState``.

    ``tile_state_factory(tile_cfg)`` must build a state with THE SAME PHYSICS
    SELECTORS the domain was prepared with, already warmed by one step.  Both
    conditions are essential and both are checked rather than trusted: a
    buffer missing a scheme owns a different carrier set and the inventory
    comparison refuses it, and two carriers (Kain-Fritsch's ``cumulus/w0avg``
    above all) are allocated LAZILY on first use, so an unwarmed buffer is
    missing arrays the store holds.

    ``template`` is the state a STORE-DIRECT domain answers height-invariant
    questions with, and it is the second half of the ``store`` road rather
    than an option on it.  Two consumers here take a live state and neither
    can be handed a tile buffer: ``tilestream.output.frame_plan`` MEASURES
    which wrfout fields exist and where each comes from by building the real
    device frame and matching object identity (a transcribed table would drift
    the first time a scheme published a new diagnostic), and the restart
    header's vertical setup arrays are rebuilt from ``nz``/``hybrid_opt``/
    ``etac``/``p_top``.  Both answers are the same at every height and neither
    is the same on a tile whose config is not the domain's.  So a store built
    slab by slab keeps its LAST SLAB (``PreparedStore.template``) and that is
    what belongs here; without it a store-direct domain still integrates,
    checkpoints and folds its health, and refuses at the first history frame.

    ``geography`` is the DOMAIN's :func:`tilestream.driver.geography_inventory`
    -- it is INPUT, gathered per buffer and never scattered.

    The lateral forcing arrives either as ``boundaries`` (the DOMAIN's
    ``LateralBoundaries``, windowed here) or as ``boundary_tables`` (already
    windowed, one per tile, in :func:`tile_specs` order).  A route that has
    to build its tile buffers with an attachment already on them -- which
    every specified-BC route does, because a buffer cannot take its warmup
    step without one -- windows once with :func:`tile_boundary_tables` and
    passes the result both ways, rather than windowing twice.

    Fresh is the essential word, and it is a bug this function was

    DOMAIN's adapter object looks harmless -- Kain-Fritsch's constructor
    takes no arguments and holds no configuration -- and is not: ``w0avg``
    is a CARRIER (``cumulus/w0avg``), so all the buffers and the domain
    would share one array while the transport gathered and scattered it as
    if each buffer owned its own.  ``KainFritsch`` also caches
    ``_history_state``, a reference to the last state it served, and
    ``tilestream.driver.assert_geography_gathered`` walks it: with the
    object shared, buffer 0's adapter pointed at buffer 1's state and the
    check reported buffer 1's radiation lat/lon as ungatherable geography.
    That is what caught it, and it is why ``check_geography`` is left ON.

    Three shapes of adapter, and the rule is the same for all three --
    reproduce the POLICY exactly, replace only the geography:

    *dataclasses* (RRTMGP, the analytic scheme, Noah-MP's geometry) carry
    their policy as init fields -- ``column_chunk``,
    ``trace_gas_overrides``, ``p_top`` -- and their per-column geography as
    ``latitude_deg``/``longitude_deg``.  ``dataclasses.replace`` gives a new
    instance that differs in exactly the two fields the gather is going to
    overwrite anyway.

    *plain objects with an empty constructor* (Kain-Fritsch) are
    reconstructed by calling their class.  That is only correct if the class
    asks for nothing and configures nothing, so both are CHECKED: a
    constructor with a required parameter gets no default reconstruction,
    and neither does any scalar attribute on which the fresh instance and
    the domain's disagree -- which is what a policy the reconstruction
    dropped would look like.  An adapter reconstructed with default policy
    allocates the same carriers and passes the inventory check, so nothing
    downstream would catch it.

    *plain objects that require arguments* (legacy RRTMG) get an explicit
    recipe from :data:`_TWIN_RECIPES`, audited two ways: the recipe must
    name every constructor parameter, and the twin it returns must agree
    with the domain's adapter on every non-volatile scalar.  This branch was
    once the refusal itself -- legacy RRTMG is the DEFAULT radiation of the
    shipped physics suite, so streaming refused the default suite outright,
    and the docstring here asserted legacy RRTMG was a dataclass, which is
    part of how it went unnoticed.  The refusal below is deliberately kept
    for adapters with no recipe: sharing the domain's object is still not
    the fallback.

    stretch.  A real case runs its own explicit eta table.  Its own docstring
    says a real case must supply ``coord`` and that arrays built from the
    wrong table "are the right shape, the right dtype, and wrong, and nothing
    downstream notices"; the prepared factory then did not supply it.

    :func:`_impose_domain_setup` half-hid the consequence.  It copies the
    domain's PURELY VERTICAL setup (``znu``, ``znw``, ``dnw``, ``c1h..c4f``,
    ``p_top``, ``mub``, ``cf1..cfn1``) onto the buffer, so those became the

    a pressure column from another.

    surface theta, taken at 41 hPa: a surface level's theta at the model
    top's pressure, which is the signature of two mismatched coordinates and
    not of uninitialised memory.  Legacy RRTMG has no such validator, so on
    that suite the same wrong warm-up ran silently instead of stopping.

    reached by :func:`prime_lazy_carriers` rather than by throwing away a
    step -- see there for the temperature field the thrown-away step used to
    hand the radiation.  Four things go into satisfying the contract from a
    prepared node, and each of them has a specific failure it prevents:

    *the selectors come from the config, so they are free.*  ``tile_cfg`` is
    the domain's own ``RunConfig`` with only ``nx``/``ny`` replaced
    (:func:`tilestream.harness.tile_config`), so every ``*_physics`` switch,
    every cadence and every damping constant is the domain's by construction
    rather than by being copied correctly.

    *the buffer is built on NEUTRAL geography, not on the tile's own.*
    :func:`tilestream.harness.neutral_geography` is a POISON fill -- identity
    map factors, zero Coriolis, flat terrain, a latitude nowhere near the
    domain's -- so an array the gather fails to write is obviously wrong
    rather than plausibly wrong.  It still has to be a full ``(ny, nx)``
    terrain field, because ``cfg.terrain_opt`` decides whether ``thb/pb/alb/
    phb`` are 1-D or 3-D and a buffer built flat against a domain with
    terrain has the wrong SHAPES.

    *the scheme adapters are CLONED, not reconstructed.*  See
    :func:`_clone_scheme_at`.

    *the vertical coordinate is inherited.*  See
    :data:`_INHERITED_SETUP_SCALARS`.

    ``tables0`` is tile 0's windowed lateral forcing.  It is attached before
    the warmup step and replaced by the ``tile_hook`` before the buffer ever
    serves a tile: with ``cfg.specified=True``, ``dycore.step`` calls
    ``apply_state_lateral_boundaries``, which raises without an attachment,
    so a buffer cannot take its warmup step at all until it holds tables of
    the right shape -- and the right shape is a property of the tiling.

    The warmup step is not optional either.  Two carriers are allocated
    LAZILY on first use, Kain-Fritsch's ``cumulus/w0avg`` above all, so a
    buffer that has never stepped is missing arrays the store holds and the
    inventory comparison refuses it.

    :func:`prepared_domain_builder`'s counterpart for a domain that was never
    resident.  ``bundle`` is a
    :class:`woof.ingest.prepared_store.PreparedStore`: its carriers and its
    geography are already full-domain pinned host arrays, built slab by slab
    off the prepared cache, and its lateral forcing is the domain's own
    series held on the host.

    Everything the resident builder reads off ``node.state`` is read off the
    bundle instead, and the substitution is exact rather than approximate in
    all three places:

    ``geography``
        the bundle's, which was scattered from the same per-slab
        ``geography_inventory`` the resident road gathers from a whole
        domain.

    ``boundary_tables``
        windowed from the bundle's ``LateralBoundaries`` by the same
        :func:`tile_boundary_tables`.  The tables are never attached to a
        domain-shaped state -- there is none -- so the only lateral forcing
        that reaches the card is one tile's edge.

    ``tile_state_factory``
        :func:`prepared_tile_state_factory` on the bundle's SLAB-HEIGHT
        template.  The factory reads exactly three things from it -- the
        scheme adapters to twin, the vertical coordinate, and the
        ``ndim < 2`` setup arrays -- and none of the three varies with
        height, which is why a slab may stand in for the domain.  The
        horizontally-varying setup is gathered per tile from ``geography``,
        as it always was.

    The same slab is ALSO handed to ``attach(template=...)`` and kept on the
    domain, because two whole-domain readers downstream take a live state for
    the same height-invariant reasons the factory does: the history frame's
    plan is measured against one (``tilestream.output.store_frame_plan``) and
    the restart header's vertical setup arrays are rebuilt from one
    (:meth:`StreamedDomain.restart_setup`).  Passing it is what makes a
    store-direct forecast able to publish wrfout at all -- without it the run
    integrates and checkpoints correctly and refuses at its first history
    frame, which is an hour into an otherwise healthy forecast.

    ``prime_lazy_carriers`` is not called on a domain here because there is
    no domain-shaped object to call it on; it ran on every SLAB as the store
    was built, which is the same set of keys reached the same way.  The
    buffers are primed in the factory as before, and ``TiledRun``'s
    inventory comparison still refuses any disagreement between a buffer and
    the store -- the check that would catch it if this reasoning were wrong.

    after preprocessing, after every prepared cache has been restored and

    downstream of the load that could have produced it.  A user who turned
    streaming on because their domain does not fit therefore pays the entire
    preparation and then meets an out-of-memory death at the allocation the
    mode existed to avoid -- and, if it somehow fits, a refusal whose message
    they will read as something the run did rather than something the config
    always was.

    WHO STILL CALLS THIS, and who stopped.  ``woof run``
    (:func:`woof.runtime.run_experiment`) does, with
    ``consults_the_seam=False``, because it reads ``exp.tiles`` at no point.
    The two prepared routes and ``woof go`` do NOT, any more: they wire
    :func:`builders_for_tree` and stream for real.  Their calls outlived the
    wiring by a release and refused ``mode = "on"`` -- the one mode that asks
    for streaming unconditionally -- with a message asserting the route wired
    no builder, while ``mode = "auto"`` went through that same builder and
    streamed.  So a user who wrote the explicit form got a refusal quoting a
    fact that had stopped being true, and ``go``, the front door most users
    type, mirrored it before the download.  Removed there; kept here for the
    route that genuinely cannot honour the mode.

    ``mode = "on"`` is knowable at admission with NO device work at all: it
    streams unconditionally, consults no planner and needs no card.  So it is
    refused here.  ``mode = "auto"`` is by default NOT refused: it asks
    :mod:`tilestream.autoplan` about a specific card and legitimately answers
    "resident" on a machine where the domain fits, and asking that question
    at admission would stand up a CUDA primary context in a process that has
    not decided to use the device yet (the reason ``go``'s memory gate probes
    in a subprocess).  What ``auto`` does on a domain that does NOT fit is a
    separate and unfixed gap, named in the message rather than papered over.

    ``consults_the_seam=False`` refuses ``auto`` as well, and is for a route
    that never calls :func:`make_stepper` or :func:`steppers_for_tree` at
    all.  ``woof run`` (:func:`woof.runtime.run_experiment`) is one:
    neither its single-domain arm nor either of its tree arms reads
    ``exp.tiles``, so ``auto`` there is not "asked and answered
    resident" -- it is never asked, and the run proceeds resident with
    nothing said.  That is precisely the silence this module's docstring
    forbids ("Refused rather than silently integrated resident"), and on a

    """``{grid_id: stepper}`` for a whole domain tree.

    The route-facing entry point, and the reason the mode is configurable at
    all: a route reads ``exp.tiles``, calls this, and hands the result to
    :func:`woof.core.model.execute_experiment`.

    With ``[tiles]`` absent -- the default -- this returns an EMPTY dict
    and touches nothing: no planner, no cupy, no ``tilestream`` import, and
    every grid falls through to ``dycore.step`` inside the executor.  A
    resident forecast therefore pays exactly nothing for the mode's
    existence, which is the only acceptable price for a feature most runs
    will never use.

    ``builders`` is ``{grid_id: build}``, the per-domain construction
    :func:`make_stepper` needs.  A domain whose decision says STREAM and
    whose route wired no builder is REFUSED, loudly, rather than quietly run
    resident: the failure that silence produces is an out-of-memory death at
    the allocation the mode existed to avoid, with nothing in the log to say
    the mode never engaged.

    A nest uses the shared child table road. Parent and child may both
    stream; each domain and coupling corridor is charged to the same device
    and host ledgers before any builder runs.

    ``decisions`` IS NOT OPTIONAL DECORATION -- IT IS THE OTHER FAILURE
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    The return value cannot answer the question an operator actually asks.
    A grid that streamed appears in it; a grid that did NOT stream is simply
    absent, and absent is exactly what a grid looks like under
    ``[tiles]`` that was never configured at all.  So ``mode = "auto"``
    on a domain that fits returns ``{}`` -- the same empty dict as ``mode =
    "off"``, the same empty dict as a config with no ``[tiles]`` table --
    and the run proceeds resident with nothing anywhere to say that the mode
    was asked for and declined.

    That is not a hypothetical.  It is the shape of a FALSE PASS: point a
    streaming test at ``auto``, watch it go green, and conclude that
    streaming works, when what was actually measured is a resident run
    compared against a resident run.  This project has produced results that
    way, and a control that cannot fail is the recurring cause.

    Passing a mutable mapping as ``decisions`` fills it with ``{grid_id:
    StreamingDecision}`` for EVERY grid walked -- streamed or not -- so the
    caller holds the decision and its stated reason rather than inferring
    the decision from a hole in a dict.  :func:`streaming_receipt` turns
    that mapping into the run's receipt.  Callers that genuinely do not care
    may still omit it; the routes may not, and
    ``tilestream/test_route.py::control_auto_records_that_it_declined``
    fails if a route stops recording.

    ``tree_decision`` IS THE RUN'S ONE ADMISSION, ALREADY TAKEN
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    A route whose door already asked :func:`decide_tree` -- the prepared
    domain-tree forecast does, before authority, fetch, manifest and
    prepare, so that a refusal costs the user nothing -- passes THAT
    :class:`TreeDecision` here and this function decides nothing.  Asking
    twice is not a redundant check, it is a second admission: the door
    prices from :func:`woof.core.preflight.admission_estimate` and marks
    the moving subtree off the declared experiment, while a build-time
    walk priced from the run's own richer ledger estimate and marked off
    whatever the model carried, so the two passes could weigh different
    envelopes against different budgets and the run would then execute a
    road the user was never shown.  The decision reaches the LIVE nodes by
    grid id (:func:`_decided_for_live_nodes`); the states come from the
    model, and so does the moving-subtree marking
    (:func:`woof.core.streamed_relocation.mark_reconstruction_nodes`,
    applied to the live nodes on BOTH paths so that a tree whose road came
    in from the door still knows here which of its grids relocate).

    ``decisions`` is filled with ``{grid_id: StreamingDecision}`` for EVERY
    grid THIS WALK SEES -- every node of the live tree, streamed or not, on
    either path -- and it is the receipt's source.  A door that decided a
    grid this walk has no live node for keeps that decision on its own
    :class:`TreeDecision`; a live grid the decision does not cover is
    refused rather than quietly re-decided (:func:`_decided_for_live_nodes`).  It has to be an
    out-parameter rather than a second call to :func:`decide`, because under
    ``auto`` the decision is a function of the free VRAM at the instant it
    was taken: a receipt that re-derived it later would be describing a
    different card.  A run receipt that records a memory estimate and an
    observed peak beside each other, with nothing saying which execution mode
    produced them, is a receipt whose two memory numbers cannot be compared
    -- a streamed domain's observed peak is a handful of tile buffers against
    an estimate priced for a whole resident domain.

    # It is the wrong law for a STREAMED one, because a streamed domain's
    # claim is not fixed: the tile search maximises the compute window
    # against whatever budget it is shown, so a streamed parent took the
    # largest clean tile that fit the whole card -- MEASURED at 3.94 of
    # 4.00 GiB, 98.5% -- and its resident child then met the planner's
    # "no tile fits in 0.06 GiB".  STREAMED PARENT + RESIDENT CHILD is a
    # shape the engine runs bit-identically; only the order of the
    # arithmetic made it unreachable.
    #
    # So the successors are priced FIRST, at the floor each of them can
    # run in, and a streamed domain's tile search sees budget-minus-
    # successors.  A parent on a smaller tile is a slower parent; a
    # starved child is no run at all, and the tiling tax is 1.2x-1.4x
    # against a refusal.
    #
    # The reservation constrains the TILE, never the VERDICT: the
    # stream-or-resident question is still asked against the budget the
    # predecessors left, exactly as before, so a tree that ran all-resident
    # decides all-resident still and no existing road moves.
    #
    # AND THE PER-PROCESS FIXED COST IS CHARGED ONCE, NOT ONCE PER DOMAIN.
    # ``autoplan.Footprint.vram_bytes`` prices ONE domain in ONE process,
    # so it carries the CUDA context and the rung's k-distribution tables
    # inside it.  Subtracting that whole number per domain charged the
    # tables once per grid: 3.760 GiB of phantom bytes for every domain
    # after the first at the ``full`` rung, 7.519 GiB on a three-domain
    # tree -- enough that a tree priced at 12.41 GiB was refused outright
    # on a 16.30 GiB card.  It is the same measurement autoplan's own
    # docstring makes about tile BUFFERS ("the fixed part is per PROCESS"),
    # and a tree of domains is one process too.
    #
    # So every claim below is MARGINAL and the overhead is charged once,
    # at the DEAREST rung in the tree.  The planner still prices each
    # domain whole -- ``decide`` is a single-domain question and its
    # answer stays a single-domain answer, which is what the receipt's
    # ``resident_bytes`` records -- so the budget a domain is shown is
    # reduced by the overhead of the OTHER rungs only
    # (``tree_overhead - own``).  The planner then re-adds the domain's own
    # overhead internally and the total comes out as
    # ``tree_overhead + sum(marginal)``, which is what the card holds.
    #
    # AND SO IS THE RADIATION TRANSIENT.  ``autoplan.budget_for`` reserves

    Named breakage: ``woof check`` on a nested config with ``[tiles]``
    priced only the fully-resident tree and exited 1 beside an advisory
    saying its refusal "is not the last word" -- while the run door's own
    walk (:func:`steppers_for_tree`) took a mixed road (child streamed,
    parent resident) that fit and completed.  A user read that pairing as
    "streaming has no point".  This object is the same decide pass's
    arithmetic, packaged so the report's verdict and exit code can follow
    the road the run door actually takes.

    ``rows`` is one entry per domain in walk order.  ``vram_hold_bytes``
    is the tree's once-per-process floor plus every marginal claim and
    corridor claim -- what the card holds between radiation calls -- and
    :attr:`peak_vram_bytes` adds the tree's radiation reservation, the
    figure every admission question is asked of (the same pairing
    :class:`StreamedEnvelope` documents).  ``refusal`` carries the walk's
    own sentence when no road runs this tree; ``priced`` is False only
    when the walk did not complete, and so produced no claims to read.

    ``priced`` used to mean "some domain consulted the PLANNER", which is
    a different question and the wrong one: every term of this pricing is
    a read off the rung's footprint and the tiling, so a tree that pins
    every tiling probes no card AND still has a number.  Conflating the

    ``streamed_any`` is the field to assert on.  It is stated as a positive
    boolean rather than left implicit in the size of ``domains`` because the
    thing being guarded against is a reader -- human or test -- treating the
    ABSENCE of evidence as evidence: an ``auto`` run that declined and an
    ``off`` run are indistinguishable in the stepper dict, and were
    indistinguishable in the receipt too until this existed.

    ``summary`` is the one line a route prints.  It always names the mode
    that was CONFIGURED next to what actually happened, because those two
    differing is the entire failure: ``mode='auto'`` is a request, not an
    outcome, and a log that echoes only the request is a log that will be
    read as an outcome.

    KEYED ON THE DECISIONS, NOT ON THE TREE-WIDE TABLE
    --------------------------------------------------
    This function used to open with ``not options.enabled`` and return
    ``{}``, which made the TREE-WIDE ``[tiles]`` table the authority on
    whether anything streamed.  It is not the authority -- it is the
    DEFAULT.  Since the surface went per domain, a tree whose tree-wide
    mode is ``off`` and one of whose ``[[domain]]`` rows carries ``tiles =
    {mode = "on"}`` streams that grid, and every such run produced an
    EMPTY receipt: the operator got no line naming which grid had tiled.
    That is the same class of defect :func:`tree_streams_anywhere` exists
    to close -- a per-domain road the tree-wide table cannot see -- and it
    is closed the same way, by reading what the domains DECIDED.

    ``decisions`` is the right key because it is filled by
    :func:`steppers_for_tree` for EVERY grid walked and only for a tree
    that is configured somewhere: an unconfigured tree returns early on
    ``tree_streams_anywhere`` and never fills it, so the empty receipt
    that keeps pre-``[tiles]`` runs byte-identical still comes out empty.

    THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES, which cost a whole diagnostic its meaning.
    A streamed domain's arrays live in the store; the ``DomainState`` the
    model still holds was copied into that store at :func:`attach` and has
    been a corpse ever since.  Reading it is harmless -- nothing does -- but
    WRITING it is not, and three consumers write it every run.  The
    ``nwp_diagnostics`` running maxima are reset externally, by whoever read
    them: ``uh_diag.reset_up_heli_max`` after each history frame is durable,
    and ``uh_diag.reset_tracker_window`` by the relocation runner at every
    evaluation and by the spawn runner at every leg boundary.  Each of those
    reached ``state.existing_scratch(slot)`` and zeroed it, so under a host
    store the fold landed in the store while the reset landed on the corpse
    and the window never actually reset.  "Max since I last looked" silently
    became "max since the run began" -- monotonically biasing the tracker and
    the spawn trigger toward firing early and never releasing, with no NaN
    and no warning, and invisible in any run too short to cross a reset.

    So a consumer that resets a whole-domain accumulator asks for the arrays
    rather than for the state's, and gets one array resident, two streamed
    (the store's, which is the domain, and the state's, which is kept
    consistent so a later re-attach cannot resurrect the stale one).

    SAFE TO WRITE BETWEEN STEPS AND ONLY BETWEEN STEPS.  The store is written
    by tile scatters on non-blocking streams, but ``TiledRun.sweep``
    synchronises every stream and the device before it returns, so the store
    is quiescent at exactly the instants the model does its output, restart
    and diagnostic work.  Anything that wrote it from inside a sweep would be
    racing the scatters.

    ORDER IS PART OF THE CONTRACT: the state's own buffer first, the store's
    last, so ``live_scratch(...)[-1]`` is the authoritative one.
    :func:`domain_scratch` is that expression named, and a READER must use it
    -- the same corpse that swallowed the resets would otherwise be handed to
    the storm tracker as the field it steers on.

    "Between steps" is enforced here rather than assumed: under the driver's
    deferred sweep seam a sweep returns with its scatters still in flight,
    so this drains the streamed domain before handing out arrays anything
    will write.  A resident state, and every test double without a drain,
