"""The MYNN PBL coupling layer: WRF's ``mynnedmf_wrapper_run``, on device.

``module_pbl_driver.F:1660-1721`` does **not** call ``mynn_bl_driver``.  It
calls ``mynnedmf_wrapper_run`` (``module_bl_mynn_wrapper.F``), and that
wrapper owns three things the column solver does not:

* the mixing-ratio to specific-humidity conversion on the way in
  (``:453-475``) and the reverse on the tendencies and the subgrid cloud
  water on the way out (``:587-607``);
* ``initflag = 1`` on ``itimestep == 1`` and 0 afterwards (``:1643-1647``),
  which is what selects ``mym_initialize`` over the carried state; and
* the per-``j``-row packing that woof replaces with a single
  level-major column chunk, since every column is independent.

Keeping it in its own module rather than inside :mod:`woof.core.physics`
means the unit conversions live next to the source anchor that justifies
them.  Losing either one is a silent O(qv) bias in the moisture tendency,
not a crash, which is the kind of defect that survives a smoke test.

#: ``28`` (Registry.EM_COMMON:3036, package ``thompsonaero``:
#: ``moist:qv,qc,qr,qi,qs,qg``) belongs here for exactly the reason 8 does,
#: and was missing while mp_physics=28 was being ported: with the flag false
#: ``module_bl_mynn.F:734`` and ``:876`` substitute ``sqs = 0``, so MYNN saw
#: no snow at all under the one Thompson variant whose package declares it,
#: and ``:1324`` skipped ``rqsblten``.  MEASURED on the committed WRF v4.6.1
#: MYNN driver oracle's ``snow_anvil`` column (max sqs 4.08e-05): the
#: substitution drove ``qi_bl`` from 5.4863e-07 to exactly 0 and moved
#: ``qc_bl``, ``cldfra_bl``, ``rqvblten``, ``rthblten`` and ``exch_h`` with
#: it.  ``woof/physics_registry_v2.json`` has published 28 as a
#: flag_qs-true selector since the scheme was registered; the two are bound
#: together by ``tests/test_physics_registry.py::
#: test_the_registry_flag_qs_contract_is_the_one_the_shipped_runtime_applies``.

#: ``Registry.EM_COMMON:3025`` declares ``package milbrandt2mom
#: mp_physics==9 - moist:qv,qc,qr,qi,qs,qg,qh``, so F_QS is true and
#: MYNN must see the scheme's snow.
#:
#: ``mp_physics = 50`` (P3 one-category) is deliberately ABSENT, and it is
#: the one selector whose absence needs no apology: P3 carries a single ice
#: category and its Registry package is ``moist:qv,qc,qr,qi`` with no ``qs``
#: at all (``Registry.EM_COMMON:3038``), so WRF's ``F_QS`` is false and
#: MYNN's ``sqs = 0`` is the scheme's own answer rather than a withheld
#: field.  Contrast mp=28, which HAD snow and was wrongly excluded here.

#: ``Registry.EM_COMMON:3031`` declares ``package wdm6scheme
#: mp_physics==16 - moist:qv,qc,qr,qi,qs,qg;scalar:qnn,qnc,qnr``, so F_QS
