"""Activate spawn-triggered nests at leg boundaries.

The companion to :class:`woof.core.relocation_runner.RelocationRunner`,
and deliberately a DIFFERENT cadence granularity, for a structural
reason worth stating once:

A relocation changes a live child's ``i_parent_start``/``j_parent_start``
and nothing the schedule depends on, so the runner mutates the node in
place inside one :func:`woof.core.model.execute_experiment` call.  A
SPAWN adds a domain to the tree, and
:func:`woof.core.clock.build_schedule` bakes each domain's activation
tick into precomputed per-period op lists
(``active = {gid for gid in step if starts[gid] <= start_ticks}``) --
a trigger-driven domain has no activation tick when that expansion runs,
so it cannot be in the schedule, and no in-place hook can add it.
Activation is therefore leg-boundary schedule surgery, exactly as
``docs/nest-spawn-at-trigger.md`` specifies: the leg before a fire
integrates ``active_experiment(exp)``, the leg after integrates
``active_experiment(exp, {gid: (i, j)})``.

This module is the mechanism for that boundary.  Construction is the
route's job because the route owns the two things neither the mechanism
nor the policy can invent: the ``on_child_built`` preparer that gives a
newborn child its physics/land driver, and the assembler that rebuilds
the next leg's tree.  The runner supplies the assembler's missing half
through :meth:`SpawnRunner.child_initializer`.

#: every one of them (that is the audit trail); memory keeps a recent
#: window, so the ledger a caller embeds in its own receipt is bounded by
#: the CONFIG rather than by the forecast length.  Decisions -- a spawn,
#: a retirement, a re-arm, the closing summary -- are never evicted:
#: their count is bounded by slots x max_firings, so keeping them all
#: costs nothing that grows.
#:
#: 64 is a window, not a budget: enough that a failure's recent history
#: is in hand without opening the file, small enough that the ledger is

#: entire ledger at every boundary, so the bytes a run wrote grew as the
#: SQUARE of its length -- at 384 h that is tens of gigabytes of writes
#: to a diagnostic nobody reads until the run ends.  It also republished
#: through a temporary and ``os.replace``, which is the exact pattern
#: that killed a 6 h run on Windows when a user tailed the file
#: (WinError 5); the track writer already moved off it for that reason
#: (woof.core.storm_track_writer._Stream.open) and this follows it.

        ``None`` means "the next boundary, whenever it is": something

        walk must keep asking.  A number means nothing can happen before
        it, and :func:`woof.runtime.spawn_leg_boundary` may run the leg
        straight to it.

        THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES.  :attr:`needs_boundaries` stays true for
        the whole run whenever any retired slot can still re-arm, and
        every boundary it grants costs one full schedule rebuild
        (:func:`woof.runtime.walk_spawn_legs`).  A 384 h run with a
        re-armable slot therefore rebuilt its schedule ~4,600 times to
        discover ~4,600 times that a cooldown had not elapsed.  A
        cooldown is a KNOWN instant; so is a window that has not opened,
        and so is a manual trigger.  Each of those contributes its own
        instant here instead of a boundary.

        Deliberately EARLY where it cannot be exact: a slot whose re-arm
        also waits on a parent episode reports its cooldown anyway.
        Asking too soon costs one rebuild; asking too late would miss a
        decision, and this is a cost fix, not a policy change.

        A STASH-BACKED WATCH FORFEITS THE WHOLE OPTIMISATION, and that is
        the one place skipping a boundary would change an ANSWER rather
        than a cost.  ``uh`` and ``reflectivity`` are consumer-owned
        windows that this runner ZEROES at every boundary it takes: the
        signal a watch reads is "the strongest since I last looked".
        Skip six hours of boundaries and the next look sees six hours of
        accumulation, so a slot coming off its cooldown would fire
        immediately on rotation that happened while it was spent -- the
        same stale-signal episode the re-arm's own "not at this
        boundary" rule exists to prevent.  Whenever any slot that can
        still act reads one of those planes, every boundary is taken.
        Pressure is exempt because it is reduced from the live column and
        carries no window at all (STASH_BACKED_FIELDS).
