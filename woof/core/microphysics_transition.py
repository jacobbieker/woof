"""Explicit one-way nest microphysics transition contracts.

Stock WRF v4.6.1 accepts an ``mp_physics(max_domains)`` namelist vector but
``share/module_check_a_mundo.F:774-790`` replaces every entry with the
innermost-domain selector.  WRF therefore has no executable mixed-scheme nest
edge.  The matrix in this module is a WOOF extension: shared mass species
are mapped, absent target mass species use their scheme cold-start default,
and target number/volume moments are diagnosed from target mass.

The previously ratified Thompson MP8 -> NSSL-2 MP18 path retains its original
policy id and CUDA entry point.  All other mixed edges use one matrix policy.

mp_physics=50 (P3, one-category ice with a prognostic rime pair) is a matrix
member with its own defined closure, because WRF itself defines neither
direction: entering P3 merges every frozen source species into the single ice
category mass-conservingly and DIAGNOSES the rime pair from named constants;
leaving P3 splits the single category back into qi/qs/qg by rime state,
mass-conservingly, with the degenerate cases (zero ice, zero rime) exact.
The constants and both closed forms are documented at the ``P3_EDGE_*``
constants below and recorded in every touching edge's receipt.

#: renumbers the stable host field codes ``kernels/nest_microphysics.cu``
#: switches on -- which would re-point the ratified MP8 -> MP18 nest edge at
#: different fields with nothing raising.  That is why the tuple is no
#: longer in ascending order: 16 and 28 were APPENDED when their closures
#: were ratified, and moving them to their numeric places would move
#: everything after them.
#:
#: mp_physics=50 (P3) was APPENDED after its rime-pair closure was defined,
#: documented and unit-tested (the ``P3_EDGE_*`` constants above): its
#: qv/qc/qr/qi and nr/ni reuse existing codes and its rime pair took the
#: next free codes 20/21, moving nothing -- exactly the append discipline
#: this tuple's comment demands.
#: mp_physics=9 (Milbrandt-Yau) was APPENDED after its edge closure was
#: read off the scheme itself: MY2 runs a mass-to-number consistency block
#: on entry (module_mp_milbrandt2mom.F:1459-1528, transcribed at
#: woof/core/kernels/milbrandt2.cu:547-600), so the numbers a mixed edge
#: has to diagnose are the numbers the scheme would build from those masses
#: at its own first call -- no intercept is invented and nothing is
#: borrowed from another scheme.  Its qv/qc/qr/qi/qs/qg/qh reuse existing
#: codes and only nc and nh were new, taking 22 and 23, so the append moved
#: nothing.  It is the second DUAL-RIMED selector beside mp=18 (graupel AND
#: hail as separate categories), which is what
#: :data:`_DUAL_RIMED_SELECTORS` below exists to say once.
#:
#: mp_physics=16 (WDM6) and mp_physics=28 (Thompson aerosol-aware) were
#: APPENDED next, on the same discipline and with the same shape of
#: closure: every moment they add is diagnosed by an operation this tree
#: ALREADY ships as the correct one for a laterally forced WDM6 or
#: aerosol-Thompson domain, so nothing here is a new approximation.
#:
#:   * WDM6 entry seeds nc=0, nr=0 and nn=``wdm6_ccn_conc``.  That is
#:     byte for byte what ``ingest/microphysics_cold_start.py`` and
#:     ``ingest/wrfinput.py`` already write for a fresh WDM6 domain, and
#:     ``ccn_conc`` is exactly what WRF's ``flow_dep_bdy_qnn`` feeds in
#:     through an INFLOW face (ported at ``ingest/lateral_bc.py``).  A
#:     one-way nest edge IS a lateral boundary, so the edge and the
#:     boundary now agree instead of the edge refusing what the boundary
#:     does every step.
#:   * Thompson-aerosol entry seeds nr/ni from the same two Thompson
#:     closures the mp=8 edge already runs, and nc/nwfa/nifa from WRF's
#:     own non-aerosol-aware fallbacks (module_mp_thompson.F:1248-1255,
#:     the ELSE branch mp_gt_driver takes when is_aerosol_aware is FALSE),
#:     whose constants are packaged in ``core/thompson_aerosol_contract``.
#:
#: EXIT edges needed no closure at all and were being refused anyway: the

#: the kernel and the departing scheme's reservoir/aerosol fields are
#: dropped, which is what ``species_actions`` has always receipted.

#: turns on which of the two shapes each end of an edge has.  Spelled once,
