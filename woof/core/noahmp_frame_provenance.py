"""Noah-MP local-frame pricing: per-platform recordings, the card's own
row when it has one, the ceiling over the recorded platforms when it does
not, and the basis stated beside the number either way.

The five composed Noah-MP translation units (``noahmp_leaves.cu`` prepended
to a fragment that borrows its r_pow/r_exp/r_log) never compile alone, so
the standalone ``*.cu`` census in :mod:`woof.core.kernel_frame_recordings`
cannot reach them and ``sf_surface_physics = 4`` was refused a memory price
for as long as that census was the only source of frames.  The frames the
model launches are the frames of the units
:mod:`woof.core.noahmp_kernel_sources` composes, and those are what
:data:`woof.core.kernel_frame_recordings.NOAHMP_COMPOSED_FRAME_RECORDINGS`
records -- one row per compile platform, read on that platform.

Three rules:

* The frame is a compile attribute of (target architecture, NVRTC build).
  A card whose compile platform has a row is priced from that row, and
  the basis says the frames were MEASURED on its platform.
* A card whose compile platform has no row -- a card whose platform was
  not read (an absent card, a declared ``--vram-gib`` card, this machine
  under ``GPUWM_NO_LOCAL_GPU``), or a card on a pair nobody has read --
  is priced the way every other kernel is priced on an unrecorded
  platform: from the element-wise CEILING over the recorded rows, never
  below any reading, and the basis says so in words a user can see
  ("priced from the ceiling over the recorded platforms ...; not measured
  on this card").  This is the rule since 2026-09-11: a refusal by name on
  every unrecorded card kept Noah-MP out of reach of the shipped desktop
  runtime, whose card and compiler nobody had read, while the standalone
  kernels beside it were priced from their ceiling without complaint.
* A row must describe the units in the tree.  Each row binds the
  ``identity_sha256`` of every unit it read; a source, option or export
  edit stops the row matching, the row is withdrawn from both the exact
  match and the ceiling, and the basis says the platform's row went
  stale.  With NO usable reading at all -- no row, or every row stale --
  the units are priced at the tree's assumed frame bound
  (:func:`woof.core.kernel_frame_recordings.assumed_frame_bound`), the
  widest frame any module has been recorded at, and the basis says the
  number is an assumed bound and names the tool that takes a reading.
  Nothing here refuses a run for a missing reading.
  ``tests/test_noahmp_frame_provenance.py`` turns a stale row into a red
  CPU test the day the sources move.

Everything the estimator calls here is CPU-only.  :func:`measure_live` is
the GPU half -- what ``tools/measure_noahmp_frames.py`` runs in a fresh
process to take a row -- and the only function that imports CuPy.
