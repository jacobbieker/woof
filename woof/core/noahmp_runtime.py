"""The Noah-MP coupling layer: WRF's ``noahmplsm`` driver, column by column.

``module_surface_driver.F:3127-3181`` does **not** call ``NOAHMP_SFLX``.  It
calls ``noahmplsm`` (``phys/module_sf_noahmpdrv.F:12-1432``), and that driver
owns everything between WRF's grid arrays and the column solver:

* the ``ITIMESTEP == 1`` open-water / sea-ice soil initialisation (:689-711);
* the sea-ice and open-water ``CYCLE ILOOP`` skips (:715-725), which decide
  which columns the LSM touches at all;
* the 2-D-to-1-D forcing marshalling (:729-796), including
  ``Q_ML = QV3D/(1+QV3D)``, ``P_ML`` from the two lowest interfaces, and
  ``Z_ML = 0.5*DZ8W(1)``;
* the soil-type water override, the urban vegetation remap, the
  ``VEGTYP in {25,26,27}`` bare override and the ``FICEOLD`` reconstruction
  (:912-1044);
* ``TRANSFER_MP_PARAMETERS`` per column (:962); and
* the write-back (:1223-1400), which is where ``TSK = TRAD``,
  ``CANWAT = CANLIQ + CANICE``, ``Q2MV = Q2MV/(1-Q2MV)`` and the
  SOILENERGY/SNOWENERGY integrals live.

Losing any of it is not a crash.  Losing the ``Q_ML`` conversion is an O(qv)
bias in every flux; losing the open-water skip runs a land model on the sea;
losing ``TSK = TRAD`` leaves the radiative temperature out of the surface
layer's next call.  So this module is that driver, with the anchors next to
the arithmetic.

Where the column runs
---------------------
On the forecast path, nowhere in Python per column.  :func:`noahmp_lsm_step`
dispatches to :func:`_lsm_step_slab`, which evaluates the driver prologue as
whole-grid CuPy statements and answers the land columns through
:func:`woof.core.noahmp_column_slab.evaluate_sflx_slab` -- the eight leaf
batches, ENERGY's four composition segments and ``sflx_post``'s two, launched
in the scalar order over chunks of :data:`SLAB_COLUMN_CHUNK` columns.
Measured twice at 360,000 land columns on one RTX 5090, that call costs
0.202--0.227 s against 166--206 s through the staged path below in the same
process; the assembled slab is bitwise against the scalar column and against
the staged path at every width checked.

The per-column seam this module grew up around is **kept, not dead**: it is
the paired second implementation.  :func:`sflx_steps` starts one generator
frame per column, suspends at each physical leaf call that has a device
batch (**eight** -- :data:`DEVICE_LEAF_BATCH` is the authority), and resumes
in the same frame.  It is what runs when ``WOOF_NOAHMP_STAGED_COLUMNS=1``
selects it by name, when a test binds another evaluator, or when
``WOOF_NOAHMP_HOST_LEAVES=1`` asks for the CPython leaves -- and the
six-step digest gates in ``tests/test_noahmp_runtime.py`` are what hold the
two paths to the same answer, bit for bit.  Booby traps in
``tests/test_noahmp_device_wiring.py`` prove which path a forecast takes,
in both directions, because "finished, verified, and wired to nothing" has
happened twice in this repository.

The first version of this seam paused the column by *restarting* it: the
vegetated column was rewound to its entry state and replayed the pre-VEGE
prefix once the batch returned.  That was answer-preserving and it was
expensive -- it duplicated every host statement before VEGE_FLUX, which is why
the whole-column cost barely fell.  The generator continuation replaced it,
and the slab orchestration replaces the per-column frame itself.

Noah-MP has no horizontal coupling, so neither the order in which staged calls
are answered nor the tiling in :data:`COLUMN_BATCH` can change any column's
answer; :func:`evaluate_leaf_batch_on_host` is the paired authority that shows
it does not.

The published option identity
-----------------------------
:data:`NOAHMP_OPTION_IDENTITY` in :mod:`woof.config` is the enforced part --
one accepted value per namelist knob, refused by ``validate_run_config``
before a run starts.  :data:`NOAHMP_RUNTIME_RESTRICTIONS` is the rest: every
restriction that the identity schema has no field for.  Both are published
because a restriction that lives only in a docstring is a restriction a user
will meet at hour three of a forecast.
