"""Continuously observed GPU-memory high-water marks for run receipts.

The forecast runners used to assemble ``gpu_peak_used_bytes_observed``
from samples taken only inside step-boundary callbacks (the history
handler and the per-period progress callback).  ``execute_experiment``
trims the CuPy pool per STEP op and again at period commit BEFORE the
progress callback fires, so every sample landed after the intra-step
transient working set had already been released: the receipt reported
19.41 GiB against a 22.34 GiB true high-water mark on the four-domain
tree shape (-13%).  A receipt that understates VRAM is worse than no
receipt -- it invites launching a shape that demotes or OOMs.

:class:`GpuPeakMemoryWatcher` closes the gap with a lightweight daemon
thread that folds probe readings into running maxima every
``interval_seconds``, alongside the explicit boundary and end-of-run
``sample()`` calls the runners already made.  Probes are injected so
the accounting path is testable CPU-side, and each probe carries an
accurate ``scope`` label saying WHAT its number measures -- the
``cudaMemGetInfo`` view is not the whole card on a WDDM host (see
:func:`woof.core.preflight.device_wide_used_bytes`), and the CuPy pool
views are in-process only.

WHOSE BYTES.  Every view above is either in-process (the pool) or
device-wide (``cudaMemGetInfo`` and NVML's ``memory.used`` both answer
for the whole card, every process included).  A receipt built from
those alone cannot tell a run that grew from a card that filled up
underneath it: a 5 h pair of nested runs on a 32 GB card was read as
"one leg climbs to 29.8 GB and runs 2.3x slower", when the leg itself sat at
8.2-8.6 GB throughout and a second process was holding 15-17.8 GB of the
same card and running kernels on it for 98% of the leg.  The
:func:`nvidia_smi_process_probes` views split the card by process from
NVML's per-process accounting (``nvidia-smi --query-compute-apps``): the
bytes THIS process holds, the bytes every OTHER process holds, and the
device-wide figure, plus -- through the watcher's time-weighted
``nonzero_seconds`` -- how long the card was shared.  They are sampled
on their own slow cadence (one ``nvidia-smi`` pass every few seconds)
and are never strict: a host without ``nvidia-smi`` on PATH, or a WDDM
driver that reports per-process memory as N/A, records that fact in the
receipt and the forecast runs on.

WHO WAITS FOR NVIDIA-SMI.  Only a background thread of its own.  The
NVML views are ``background_only`` probes: the step-boundary
``sample()`` the runners call on the forecast's main thread never reads
them, and the 20 Hz peak thread never reads them either.  Measured
defect this replaces (2026-10-05, shared 8-card box): ``sample()`` ran
the due NVML probes inline, two ``nvidia-smi`` subprocesses every 2 s on
the main thread; on a busy box one call takes 0.5 s to several seconds
(the process sits in D state), and a 750 m city run that stepped in
0.02 s per step took 4.5-8.8 s per outer step -- 240 s per forecast
hour against about 24.  On an idle single-card host the same pair still
cost about 2 x 50 ms of main-thread wall every 2 s.  The receipts keep
every view; what changed is WHEN the NVML views are read: on the NVML
thread's own 2 s cadence from ``start()`` until ``stop()``, no longer
also at a boundary sample, and a pass still in flight when ``stop()`` is
called is dropped rather than waited for (the summary says so).

Overhead: one probe pass per tick.  The watcher machinery itself
measures in single-digit microseconds per pass CPU-side; at the default
20 Hz the device-facing cost is one ``cudaMemGetInfo`` plus two pool
counter reads per tick -- the same queries the boundary callbacks
already issued, now on a fixed, low cadence instead of per event.  The
NVML views add one ``nvidia-smi`` subprocess pair per
:data:`NVIDIA_SMI_INTERVAL_SECONDS` from their own daemon thread, each
call bounded by :data:`NVIDIA_SMI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`; the main thread's
boundary ``sample()`` costs three in-process counter reads.
