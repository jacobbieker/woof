# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# How a domain obtained its ozone, named once.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# WRF v4.7.1, EM_CORE, under ``o3input = 2``: ``oznini`` reads the packaged
# climatology and interpolates it to a domain's OWN XLAT, and the radiation
# driver runs ``ozn_time_int``/``ozn_p_int`` on that domain's own columns,
# both guarded by ``o3input .EQ. 2 .AND. id .EQ. 1``
# (phys/module_physics_init.F:2203-2212, phys/module_radiation_driver.F:
# 1801-1823).  A NEST does neither; it receives the root's field through the
# parent-to-child forcing stream the Registry declares on the variable
# (``rdf=(p2c)``, Registry/Registry.EM_COMMON:1264).
#
# So the question WRF answers is "is this domain a nest?", not "is this grid
# a refinement of another forecast?".  These four names are the four answers
# woof can give, and each one is written into the radiation identity that
# reaches a restart manifest and into the run's own report.

#: ``o3input = 0``: the legacy wrapper builds O3DATA from pressure and
#: latitude inside lwrad/swrad prep and reads no climatology at all.
ROUTING_WRAPPER_O3DATA = "wrapper-o3data"

#: A resident root (``id == 1``): the climatology chain on its own grid.
ROUTING_ROOT_CLIMATOLOGY = "root-climatology"

#: A resident nest: the parent's retained field, SINT-interpolated onto the
#: child grid, updating exactly when the parent's does.
ROUTING_PARENT_INTERPOLATED = "parent-interpolated"

#: A child integrated with no resident parent (``woof.offline_child_run``,
#: the ndown-equivalent route).  That domain is configured as a WRF ROOT and
#: reads its lateral boundaries from a file rather than from a live parent:
#: ``specified = true``, ``nested = false``, and the route stamps
#: ``parent_id = 0`` on its own ticks.  WRF's own answer for such a domain is
#: the climatology on its own grid, which is what this route evaluates.
#: Named apart from :data:`ROUTING_ROOT_CLIMATOLOGY` because the grid IS a
#: refinement of an archived forecast, and a reader of the report is owed
#: that distinction rather than being left to infer it from ``parent_id``.
