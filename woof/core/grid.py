"""Vertical eta coordinate and discretely-balanced hydrostatic base state.

Pure NumPy (float64) setup-time module.  Everything here is computed once at
model initialization and cast to FP32 only when loaded into ``DomainState``.

Conventions (WRF-ARW):
- ``znw[0] = 1.0`` (surface) ... ``znw[nz] = 0.0`` (model top);
  ``dnw[k] = znw[k+1] - znw[k] < 0``.
- The base geopotential ``phb`` satisfies the *discrete* hydrostatic relation
  ``phb[k+1] = phb[k] - dnw[k]*(c1h[k]*mub + c2h[k])*alb[k]`` exactly; the
  model's at-rest balance depends on this recurrence, not on the continuous
  integral.  For ``hybrid_opt=0`` (c1h = 1, c2h = 0) this reduces bitwise to
  the Phase 1 form ``phb[k+1] = phb[k] - dnw[k]*mub*alb[k]``.

Phase 2 additions (WRF v4 hybrid coordinate, terrain):
- ``compute_hybrid_coeffs`` builds the WRF v4 c1/c2/c3/c4 arrays
  (``c3 = B(eta)``, ``c4 = (eta - B)(p0 - pt)``, ``c1 = dB/deta``,
  ``c2 = (1 - c1)(p0 - pt)``), transcribed from WRF v4.6.1
  ``dyn_em/module_initialize_ideal.F`` (also ``nest_init_utils.F``
  ``compute_vcoord_1d_coeffs``).
- ``make_base_state`` accepts a 2-D ``terrain_z`` and then returns per-column
  base profiles with 2-D dry mass ``mub[j,i] = p_s(z_sfc[j,i]) - p_top``;
  flat terrain keeps the Phase 1 scalar/1-D broadcast forms bitwise.
