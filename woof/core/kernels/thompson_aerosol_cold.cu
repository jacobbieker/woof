// WP-06 -- aerosol-aware (mp_physics=28) COLD network for WRF v4.6.1
// Thompson.  One kernel, thompson_aa_cold_network, reproducing the whole
// sub-freezing source group of module_mp_thompson.F:2239-3190 with
// is_aerosol_aware = .TRUE., dustyIce = .TRUE., homogIce = .TRUE.,
// is_hail_aware = .FALSE., wif_input_opt = 0.
//
// Numerical authority: WRF v4.6.1 phys/module_mp_thompson.F,
// commit d66e442fccc04111067e29274c9f9eaccc3cef28.  Every bare line number
// below refers to that file.  Structural authority for everything that is
// NOT aerosol-dependent: gpuwm/core/kernels/thompson.cu's
// thompson_frozen_vapor_cloud_network (:6514-7586), which is byte-frozen and
// is transcribed -- not shared -- because cupy.RawModule has no #include
// path.  Shared device helpers come from thompson_aerosol_common.cuh, which
// gpuwm/core/kernels/__init__.py prepends to this translation unit.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT CHANGES RELATIVE TO mp=8, AND WHY EACH ONE MATTERS
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 1. nc is PROGNOSTIC.  thompson.cu freezes the droplet number at
//    Nt_c = 100e6 m^-3 (`const float cloud_number = 100.0e6f`, :6928).  Here
//    it is rediagnosed per cell from the entry nc array through
//    thompson_aa_cloud_dist (:1826-1842), and every consumer -- the Bigg
//    freezing number cap, the droplet-bin table index, the mean volume
//    diameter, and the five cloud-number sinks -- reads that value.
//
// 1a. THE nu_c STAGING.  WRF computes nu_c at :1832 from the PRE-rediagnosis
//    nc and AGAIN at :2170 from the POST-rediagnosis nc(k) of :1840.  Only
//    the second is the working shape parameter; it feeds lamc (:2173),
//    mvd_c (:2174), Dc_g (:2181) and pnr_wau (:2191).  This kernel used to
//    take nu_c from thompson_aa_cloud_dist's ENTRY out-parameter, which is
//    the first one.  Whenever the :1834-1838 droplet-size clamp engages the
//    two differ -- measured 689 of 5400 states on a (nc, rc) grid at rho = 1
//    -- and between nu_c = 3 and nu_c = 15 the gamma products the rates are
//    built from move by 40.8x (lamc) and 15.8x (Dc_g) while pnr_wau, being
//    linear in nu_c, rescales by 5.  See thompson_aerosol_common.cuh's
//    "nu_c STAGING RULE" block.
//
//    OBSERVABILITY, MEASURED, because it explains why the committed fixtures
//    could not have caught this: in EVERY divergent state mvd_c lands on a
//    clamp bound.  That is structural, not lucky -- if the entry clamp
//    engaged then lamc = cce(2,nu)/D0c or cce(2,nu)/(2*D0r), so
//    mvd_c = (3.672+nu)/(4+nu) times D0c or 2*D0r, which is below D0c in the
//    first case and above D0r in the second for every nu in [2,15].  The
//    only observables of the staging are therefore Dc_g and pnr_wau (and
//    pnc_wau through prr_wau), all gated on rc > 0.01e-3, and the lowest
//    divergent rc that clears that gate is 3.4365e-2 kg m^-3 (re-measured in
//    wave 4 over a 60 x 80 (nc, qc) sweep: 1259 of 4800 states diverge and
//    EVERY one of them has prr_wau > 0).  No committed fixture goes there.
//
//    WAVE 4 CLOSES THE REGRESSION GAP THAT LEFT.  Wave 3's gate was a PROBE
//    comparison, and the probe/production agreement test compared ncten --
//    which on every divergent state is pinned to the nc*odts cap at :2192
//    and therefore cannot tell the two stages apart.  So nothing failed if
//    the PRODUCTION kernel regressed.  It does now:
//    test_production_kernel_uses_the_working_stage_nu_c drives THIS kernel
//    into that regime with no rain, ice, snow or graupel and compares its
//    own qr/nr/ncten against WRF's :2168-2193.  nr is the discriminator,
//    because prr_wau is pinned to rc*odts by the MIN at :2190 across the
//    whole regime while pnr_wau = prr_wau/(am_r*nu_c*10*D0r**3) stays
//    LINEAR in nu_c.  MEASURED with the working stage reverted to the entry
//    stage: qr and ncten do not move at all, and nr is wrong by 25.0% to
//    80.0% on all 36 divergent rows.
//
// 2. idx_IN IS LIVE.  thompson.cu hardcodes `const int nuclei_bin = 27` at
//    :6820 (rain freezing) and :7008 (cloud freezing), which is WRF's
//    non-aerosol default of 1 ice nucleus per litre.  Under mp=28 the index
//    is thompson_aa_in_bin(iceDeMott(...)) (:2579-2591).  This is the FIRST
//    time gpuwm reads any freezeH2O slice other than 27; 54 of the 55 IN
//    slices have never been exercised by any previous test.
//
// 3. idx_n IS LIVE.  thompson.cu hardcodes `const int cloud_number_bin = 65`
//    at :7005.  Here it is thompson_aa_droplet_bin(nc_work) (:3447-3448).
//    thompson_aa_droplet_bin(100.0e6f) == 65 is a hard identity gate in
//    tests/test_thompson_aerosol_device_helpers.py, so at nc = Nt_c this
//    reduces to what mp=8 froze.
//
// 4. iceDeMott REPLACES Cooper, it does not supplement it.  WRF:2622-2626
//    is an if/else on `dustyIce .AND. is_aerosol_aware`; the Cooper
//    expression MIN(250.E3, TNO*EXP(ATO*(T_0-temp))) that thompson.cu
//    evaluates at :6645-6646 and :7189-7200 is unreachable in mp=28 and
//    appears NOWHERE in this file.  Both of WRF's iceDeMott call sites
//    (:2574 and :2623) differ only in dead formal arguments and return the
//    identical value, so it is evaluated ONCE per cell here.
//
// 5. KOOP HOMOGENEOUS HAZE FREEZING (:2633-2643) is entirely new; classic
//    Thompson has no counterpart.  Its gate needs ns(k), WRF's EXPLICIT
//    two-gamma snow-number integral at :2081-2088 -- NOT smo0, and not
//    gpuwm's mp=8 snow number closure.  ns(k)'s ONLY use in the entire
//    routine is this gate.  pri_iha joins the shared frozen-vapor limiter
//    sum (:2862-2876); pni_iha is deliberately NOT rescaled with it, the
//    same held-number quirk WRF already applies to pni_inu.
//
// 6. FIVE CLOUD-NUMBER SINKS feed ncten: pni_wfz (Bigg immersion freezing),
//    pnc_scw (snow collecting cloud water, :2410-2411), pnc_gcw (graupel
//    collecting cloud water, :2435-2437), pnc_wau (autoconversion,
//    :2192-2193) and pnc_rcw (rain collecting cloud water, :2205-2207).
//    Each collection term is MIN'd against nc*odts individually.
//
// 7. SIX AEROSOL SCAVENGING RATES feed nwfaten/nifaten: pna_sca and pnd_scd
//    (snow, :2444-2450), pna_gca and pnd_gcd (graupel, :2461-2471) and
//    pna_rca and pnd_rcd (rain, :2212-2221), with Eff_aero collection
//    diameters 0.04 um for water-friendly aerosol and 0.8 um for
//    ice-friendly aerosol.  WRF caps each against the FULL available aerosol
//    and deliberately lets the sum overshoot, relying on the terminal floors
//    at :3979-3981; do NOT add a shared limiter across collectors.
//
// 8. TWO AEROSOL SINKS FROM NUCLEATION: nifaten -= pni_inu*orho
//    (:2974-2976, because dustyIce is a PARAMETER .true.) and
//    nwfaten -= pni_iha*orho (:2964-2965 -- Koop consumes WATER-friendly
//    aerosol, not ice nuclei).  CRITICAL NEGATIVE FINDING: Bigg immersion
//    freezing of cloud droplets and raindrops consumes NO aerosol at all.
//    nifa influences it only by shifting the freezing table's temperature
//    index through T_adjust = MAX(-3, MIN(3-LOG10(Nt_IN(m)), 3)) at :4701,
//    i.e. through idx_IN.  Adding a nifa sink for pni_wfz or pni_rfz
//    because it "seems physical" is not in WRF and would deplete ice nuclei
//    roughly an order of magnitude too fast in any glaciating cloud.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ACCUMULATOR CONTRACT
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// nc/nwfa/nifa state are READ-ONLY entry state for the whole mp=28 call.
// This kernel writes ONLY into the three per-kilogram scratch accumulators
// ncten / nwfaten / nifaten (which the adapter zeroes at entry) with `+=`,
// and a terminal WP-04 kernel applies them once with WRF's clamps
// (:3972-4021).
//
// WHY THE ACCUMULATORS ARE NOT READ BACK HERE.  At the point in WRF where
// this network runs, nwfaten/nifaten/ncten are still identically zero: they
// are first assigned in the tendency loop at :2964-3009, which is AFTER
// every process rate in :2239-2850 has been diagnosed.  The working
// per-m^3 values WRF uses inside the cold network are therefore the ENTRY
// clamps at :1805-1806 alone, and nc(k) is the entry rediagnosis at
// :1826-1842 -- not (nc1d + ncten*dt).  Reading the accumulators here would
// make the answer depend on whether the adapter happens to launch the warm
// network first, which WRF's single-pass structure never does.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE TEMPERATURE SPLIT, AND WHY IT IS EXHAUSTIVE
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// iiwarm is a PARAMETER .false. (:59) and mu_g/idx_bg are fixed, so WRF runs
// ONE column loop with two temperature branches inside it.  Only the block
// opened at :2554 is guarded by `if (temp(k).lt.T_0)`.  Everything at
// :2156-2234 (the warm-rain loop) and everything at :2402-2478 (snow/graupel
// collection of cloud water and of aerosol) runs at EVERY level.
//
// gpuwm splits that one loop across two kernels by ENTRY temperature:
//   * this kernel returns at once for temperature >= 273.15 f, and it runs
//     BEFORE any kernel has moved the temperature field, so its gate sees
//     the entry column;
//   * thompson_aerosol_warm.cu returns unless its held entry-temperature
//     mask (cp.greater_equal(temperature, 273.15), seeded before the first
//     source launch) is set.
// The two masks are exact complements of one another over every cell, with
// 273.15 K itself owned by the warm side.  Each of the ten always-run rates
// therefore appears in BOTH translation units and is evaluated EXACTLY ONCE
// per cell.  A gap or an overlap at 273.15 K is the obvious way this goes
// wrong; tests/test_thompson_aerosol_cold_gpu.py pins it at 273.15 and at
// both bracketing floats.
//
// HISTORICAL NOTE, kept because the reasoning was wrong in an instructive
// way.  This file originally omitted pnc_wau, pnc_rcw, pna_rca and pnd_rcd
// on the grounds that they were "WP-07's by the port's exclusive
// file-ownership rule".  File ownership is about who may EDIT a file, not
// about which cells a kernel is responsible for.  WP-07's kernel does own
// those four rates -- for warm cells.  Omitting them here did not delegate
// them, it deleted them for the entire sub-freezing half of the domain,
// while this kernel went on computing their MASS partners prr_wau and
// prr_rcw.  Cloud mass left without its droplet number and rain wet
// scavenging of CCN/IN was absent below freezing.
//
// EVERY level of all six committed aerosol fixtures is sub-freezing (230,
// 240 or 260 K), so WP-07's kernel returns immediately on all of them: the
// four rates reached nobody at all, and the wave-2 reference table had been
// assembled with them subtracted out, so the suite agreed with the defect.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// MEASURED AGREEMENT WITH WRF v4.6.1 (RTX 5090, CuPy 14.1.1, nvrtc c++17)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A. Six committed column fixtures, gpuwm/data/thompson/oracle-aero/, max
//    relative difference over levels carrying signal:
//      aero-scav-frozen      nwfa, nifa                        BIT-EXACT
//      aero-ice-demott-dep   nifa                              BIT-EXACT
//      aero-ice-koop         nifa BIT-EXACT, nwfa              1.78e-07
//      aero-ice-demott-idxin qi 1.20e-07 ni 6.60e-08 ncten 3.96e-08

//                            nwfaten 2.55e-07 nifaten 5.16e-07
//    aero-ice-demott-idxin is the acceptance fixture: it is the only fixture
//    in the port that pins an idx_IN other than 27, i.e. an entire freezeH2O
//    axis gpuwm had never read.
//
// B. 11340 sub-freezing states from tools/thompson_wrf461_oracle/
//    probe_cold_warm_loop_aero.F90 (COMMITTED; build_aero_probes.sh rebuilds
//    it and it reproduces its pinned SHA-256), which links the same compiled
//    module_mp_thompson.o and evaluates :1826-1842 and :2144-2232 verbatim:
//      nu_c (both stages), nc_m3, mvd_c, mvd_r                 EXACT
//      prr_wau, pnr_wau, pnc_wau                               EXACT
//      pnc_rcw, pna_rca, pnd_rcd                   <= 7.6e-16 (CSV round trip)
//    THE LAST FIVE USED TO BE THE UPSTREAM RESIDUAL AND ARE NOW GONE.  This
//    block used to read
//      mvd_c 1.23e-07, nc_m3 3.20e-07, pnc_rcw 3.25e-07
//      pnc_wau 1.97e-06, prr_wau / pnr_wau 2.31e-06
//    and attributed the last line, correctly, to thompson_aa_cloud_dist's
//    CUDA powf in thompson_aerosol_common.cuh, amplified by the Dc_b
//    cancellation at :2182 on the rc = 0.15 kg m^-3 end of the ladder.
//    Contraction-pinning everything this file owns had already taken prr_wau
//    from 1.03e-05 to 2.31e-06; making the shared droplet diagnosis
//    correctly-rounded AND contraction-pinned took the remaining 2.31e-06 to
//    zero.  Nothing in this file changed for it.
//
// C. WAVE 4 -- AGAINST WRF'S OWN POST-SOURCE TENDENCIES, not against a
//    reduction of them.  A scratch build of the WP-06 oracle, outside the
//    tree, compiles a COPY of module_mp_thompson.F carrying only added
//    `write` statements (plus three added PUBLIC probe subroutines whose
//    bodies are verbatim transcriptions of statements already in the file),
//    links the same stub_wrf.o / module_mp_radar.o / run_column_aero.o with
//    the same flags and the same four assets, and REPRODUCES ALL 38
//    COMMITTED aerosol fixture CSVs BYTE FOR BYTE.  Its instrumentation
//    publishes qiten/niten/qrten/nrten as WRF has them immediately after the
//    :3021-3092 tendency loop -- i.e. exactly what this kernel is
//    responsible for, before condensation and before any fallout.  Driving
//    this kernel on each fixture's OWN entry column, max relative
//    difference over the levels carrying signal:
//      aero-ice-koop          qi 1.152e-07   ni 8.482e-08
//      aero-cold-overlap      qi 9.950e-08   ni 1.515e-07   qr 8.795e-08
//      aero-ice-demott-idxin  qi 1.203e-07   ni 6.599e-08   qr 1.304e-08
//      aero-ice-demott-dep    qi 1.209e-07   ni 5.907e-08
//      aero-cloud-freeze-nc   qi 2.013e-08   ni 4.026e-08   qr 4.290e-08
//    (nr agrees EXACTLY wherever it moves at all; the apparent 4e-4 in a
//    finite-difference reconstruction of nrten is the reconstruction's own
//    cancellation, not a state difference.)
//
//    WHAT THAT SETTLES.  Two adapter-level G3 fixtures were open against
//    this package.  Neither is this kernel:
//
//    * aero-ice-koop, qi 1.612e-03 / ni 1.764e-03.  The whole residual is
//      ONE 2^-24 quantum of iceKoop's prob_h.  :5539 forms
//      prob_h = 1. - exp(-J*V*DT) with the exponential just below 1, so the
//      subtraction is exact and prob_h can only be an integer multiple of
//      2^-24; at this fixture's level 15 the integer is 561, so one step of
//      that grid is 1/561 = 1.78e-3 of the answer.  log_J_rate is a cubic in
//      delta_aw whose four terms (-906.7, +2.63e3, -2.59e3, +8.7e2) sum to
//      about 10.7, giving d(log10 J)/d(satw) ~ 222, so ONE float32 ulp of
//      pres (9.7e-8 relative) is enough to cross a quantum boundary.
//      tests/test_thompson_aerosol_adapter.py's entry-state reconstruction
//      perturbs p by exactly +1 ulp at that level in order to find a float32
//      theta reproducing temp_k exactly, and that costs 595.97 of 334348.6
//      crystals m^-3 = 1.7825e-3.  MEASURED, and NOT repairable inside the
//      harness: over +-256 ulps of p there is NO pressure at that level that
//      both admits an exact theta and leaves RSLF/RSIF bit-identical, and
//      driving the adapter with the exact p (accepting a 1-ulp temperature
//      instead) makes it WORSE, 3.08e-03.  Gated by
//      test_ice_koop_is_quantised_and_one_pressure_ulp_moves_it_one_quantum.
//
//    * aero-cold-overlap, the terminal droplet number.  Cloud water is
//      consumed to WRF's own R1 floor at these levels (which this port
//      reproduces BIT-EXACTLY), so :4019's rediagnosis collapses onto the
//      MAX(2./rho(k), ...) floor at :3976 and the whole residual is the
//      choice of rho.  WRF's rho(k) in that loop is the TAU+1 density -- the
//      unconditional :3193 refresh, then per level :3490 and :3572 -- and
//      thompson_aa_state_finalize is handed the ENTRY density of :1802.
//      RE-MEASURED on the regenerated fixtures with an instrumented pristine
//      WRF that reproduces all 22 committed column CSVs byte for byte: the
//      two densities differ by up to 7.4672e-03 (this fixture), and
//      recomputing :3976-4021 INSIDE WRF with the entry density substituted
//      moves nc1d at exactly one of 504 fixture levels -- aero-cold-overlap
//      k=5, 1.833336115 -> 1.826136470 kg^-1, 3.9271e-03 relative.
//      (It used to be quoted here as level 7 / 5.73e-05; that level's qc no
//      longer lands on the floor after the harness repaired its own pii.)
//      That is WP-04's kernel and WP-09's call site, not this one; the fix
//      is one added launch of thompson_aa_tau1_density immediately after
//      rain evaporation, which reproduces WRF's terminal rho BITWISE at 501
//      of those 504 levels.  Reported as an integration request.
//
// D. WAVE 4 -- ns(k), the least Fortran-verified helper in the shared
//    header, now gated against compiled WRF.  thompson_aa_snow_number is
//    BIT-EXACT against module_mp_thompson.F:2081-2088 on 3719 of 3721
//    states of a 61-temperature (273.05 to 201.05 K) x 61-snow-content
//    (1e-12 to 1e-2 kg m^-3) sweep run through the module's own
//    csg(15)/cse(15), the other 2 being ONE float32 ulp (6.924e-08) and
//    reproducing identically when the helper is rebuilt fully
//    contraction-pinned with correctly-rounded powers, i.e. not repairable.
//    The COMPOSITE path this kernel actually uses
//    (rho -> smob -> thompson_field_a/b -> smoc -> ns) is BIT-EXACT against
//    WRF's own ns(k) at all 16 snow-bearing levels of the committed
//    fixtures.  ns is NOT interchangeable with smo0: over that sweep
//    ns/smo0 runs from 0.83 to 1226, and
//    test_two_gamma_snow_number_and_not_smo0_decides_the_koop_gate makes the
//    difference PRODUCTION-observable by putting two cells either side of
//    the 999e3 gate where the two closures disagree.

// Helpers this translation unit consumes from thompson_aerosol_common.cuh.
// thompson.cu is byte-frozen and there is no #include path under

// thompson_aa_decade_index_double (thompson.cu:3084-3105, the DOUBLE-precision
// base-ten mantissa/decade bin used by the rain and graupel y-intercept
// lookups) USED TO BE DUPLICATED HERE, byte-identically with warm.cu's copy.
// It now lives in thompson_aerosol_common.cuh; see that file's PUBLISHED
// SHARED SIGNATURES block.  Do not reintroduce a local copy -- the shared
// signature is identical, so nvrtc rejects the survivor outright with
// "function has already been defined", which is exactly the diagnostic this
// consolidation exists to guarantee.
//
// thompson_aa_bound_rain_number, thompson_aa_bound_ice_number and
// thompson_aa_entry_rain_distribution USED TO BE DUPLICATED HERE with bodies
// that had already drifted from warm.cu's copies (no rain_intercept_n0, no
// contraction pinning, no unconditional :2146-2150 lamr re-derivation).
// Separate cupy.RawModule translation units mean nvrtc never sees such a
// conflict, so the drift is silent.  All three now live ONCE in
// thompson_aerosol_common.cuh; see its PUBLISHED SHARED SIGNATURES block.
// Do not reintroduce a local copy -- for the two `void` helpers that is a
// hard nvrtc redefinition error, but for the rain distribution the shared
// form takes SEVEN parameters and a six-parameter local copy would quietly
// OVERLOAD rather than collide.  That is exactly the failure mode this
