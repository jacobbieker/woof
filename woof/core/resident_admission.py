"""A domain held whole on the card is admitted, or refused by name, first.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS.  With no ``[tiles]`` block a domain is resident,
and the resident road had no admission at all: the reload doors and the
public loaders (:func:`woof.ingest.prepared_cache.restore_prepared_cache`,
the native wrfinput restore, :func:`woof.core.state.init_at_rest`) went
straight into ``DomainState``.  A 1792x1024x55 mp=18 prepared cache, or an
mp=8 one retaining 74 eager boundary intervals (25,782,246,220 bytes of state
and boundary tables before any physics), stopped in a CUDA out-of-memory part
way through its constructor instead of being refused by name.  Whether a
domain streams and whether it fits are two questions; ``mode = 'off'``
answers the first, and this module answers the second for the resident road.

Two figures, asked in two places:

* the CONSTRUCTOR FLOOR (:func:`admit_construction`): the exact
  ``DomainState`` inventory plus the lateral boundary tables the loader
  attaches, against what this process can still allocate on its card.
  Every byte of it is allocated by the loader that asks, so the floor
  never refuses a construction that would have completed.
* the FORECAST (:func:`woof.core.streaming.admit_resident_road`): state,
  physics, boundary tables, workspaces and context -- the peak envelope
  every review prices -- taken at the door before anything is restored.

The two are not the same kind of figure.  The floor is exact.  The envelope
is the measured UPPER bound of the peak, and it sits above the true peak by
design (a 552x552x49 child on a 5070 Ti card: envelope 14,922,267,728 B,
pool peak 12,428,445,696 B), so a forecast inside that margin fits a card
the envelope says it does not.  ``woof go`` has always let a reader skip its
own envelope gate for exactly that reason; ``--no-memory-gate`` at any door
(:data:`MEMORY_GATE_OVERRIDE_ENV` below it) skips the forecast envelope here
too, and the floor still refuses a state that cannot be built at all.

A card that cannot be read never refuses: the answer is then ``None`` and
the construction proceeds as it always did.

Module scope is the standard library and the refusal class; CuPy and the
estimators are imported where they are used.
