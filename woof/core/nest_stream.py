"""The streamed-child coupling corridor: rolling nest tables, per tile.

A RESIDENT child consumes FORCE output through one device attachment on its
own full-size state (``lateral_bc.attach_nest_boundaries``): full-perimeter
rolling value/tendency tables in F4/F16 manifest slots, refreshed in place
by ``bdy_interp1`` every parent step, applied with clock-recurrent dtbc.  A
STREAMED child steps as tile buffers, and a tile buffer's only boundary
door is the per-buffer attachment its tile hook installs.  This module is
the bridge: the domain keeps its rolling tables exactly as the resident
path builds them, and every tile buffer carries a PACKED, WINDOWED copy of
them -- owned sides sliced tangentially to the tile's compute window, seam
sides inert zeros -- refreshed at kernel-launch time whenever the domain's
rolling generation moves.

Three decisions carry the correctness weight:

**Copies, not views.**  The boundary kernels are raw CUDA kernels indexing
their operands linearly, so a tangential SLICE of a rolling table -- which
is strided -- would be read as the wrong bytes with no error anywhere.
Each buffer therefore owns one packed contiguous slot, the same accounting
(``lbc_forcing_tables`` scratch, ``device_nbytes``) as the specified
streaming attachment.

**Refresh at launch time, not hook time.**  ``TiledRun`` fires the tile
hook only when a buffer CHANGES tiles; with ``nbuffers >= ntiles`` that is
once per run, so a hook-time refresh would serve the first FORCE's forcing
forever -- finite, plausible and silent, the failure mode of this whole
subsystem.  Instead ``attach_nest_boundaries`` bumps a monotonic
``rolling_generation`` on the domain attachment at every FORCE, and
``_active_device_interval`` runs this module's ``nested_reload`` before
serving the nested interval: generation moved -> re-copy the owned sides
(device-to-device, O(tile boundary) bytes, owned sides only).  A buffer is
structurally unable to apply interval N's forcing to a substep of interval
N+1.

**Zeros on the seams.**  An interior side's tables are deliberately not
the domain's data, so a seam that reached a tile interior would show; the
bit-identity gate (``tilestream/test_streamed_child.py``) is the referee,
exactly as it was for the specified streamed path that proved the seam
mechanics.

The FORCE traffic half lives in :mod:`woof.core.nest`: a streamed child's
coupled-field pull is windowed to the boundary FRAME
(:func:`child_frame_windows`), because ``bdy_interp1`` reads the child
only inside its boundary zone.  The feedback pull deliberately stays
whole-field -- the restriction reads the whole child interior, and that is
the accurate cost of two-way feedback, not a windowing miss.
