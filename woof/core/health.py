"""Full-state model health validation for synchronized run boundaries.

The production path uses exactly one descriptor-driven CUDA kernel launch.
Every descriptor supplies a field pointer, bounds, optional auxiliary array,
and a stable status-class bit.  The kernel ORs every failing class and records
the lexicographically first ``(field, flat-index)`` pair.  Only that compact
record is copied to the host.  No value is clipped or repaired: a failed gate
is terminal for the worker.

The NumPy mirror below deliberately shares the descriptor/rule construction
with the CUDA path.  It is used by CPU corruption tests and by host-side LBC
or nest-table construction checks before those tables are uploaded.

    temperature carried down the dry adiabat to 1000 hPa, so the SAME
    physically ordinary stratospheric air reads ~600 K under a 100 hPa lid

    it -- while the thing it exists to catch, a thermodynamic runaway, reaches

    :class:`StateHealthValidator` needs a domain-shaped DEVICE state, which is
    precisely the object the store-direct road exists not to build -- and a
    verdict taken on the slab-height template instead would report one slab as
    the domain.  That is why the gate was left unarmed on that road.  It is not
    why it has to stay unarmed: a streamed domain IS domain-shaped, in pinned
    host memory, and :func:`validate_fields_cpu` is the production rule set
    already, sharing :func:`rule_for_field` and :func:`_bad_mask` with the
    kernel rather than restating them.  So the gate runs where the domain is.

    THE FIELD LIST IS NOT REBUILT HERE, and that is the whole design.  Two
    production walkers are run over the SAME slab-height template --
    :func:`collect_state_fields`, which says which arrays are gated and under
    which rule, and the run's own carrier inventory, which says what each array
    is called in the store -- and they are joined by ``id()``, because both
    return references to the same objects.  A field added to either side is
    therefore carried the day it is added; nothing here is a second list that
    can drift from the first.  ``backend="gpu"`` because the resident road's
    verdict is the one this must be comparable with, down to
    :func:`gpu_integer_policy`'s documented exclusions and its refusal of an
    undeclared integer dtype.

    ``domain_shape`` is ``(ny, nx)`` and is CHECKED against every substituted
    array rather than trusted, because a store accidentally holding slab-height
    arrays is exactly the silent pass this seam exists to prevent.

    ``auxiliaries`` supplies the DOMAIN-shaped form of the two descriptors that
    carry one -- ``thp``'s base-state theta and ``mup``'s base-state dry mass.
    A descriptor whose auxiliary has no domain-shaped substitute is refused
    rather than validated against the template's slab.

    Returns the report and a coverage record naming every gated field the store
    does not carry, so what the gate did NOT see is a number in a receipt
    instead of an absence a reader has to infer.
