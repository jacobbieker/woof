"""Deferred readback of the scheme health status words.

Four schemes end their step by writing a bitmask of "this output went
non-finite / out of range" into a one-word device buffer and reading it
straight back to the host:

============================  ==============================================
site                          what the word means
============================  ==============================================
``microphysics.py``           per-output finite flags for the canonical
                              surface diagnostics, plus SR below/above range
``ysu.py``                    per-output finite flags in launcher order
``kf.py``                     per-output finite flags for the KF arrays
``rrtmgp.py``                 the fused input-plausibility guard
============================  ==============================================

Each readback is a blocking device-to-host copy, and PERF-FINDINGS.md measures
one at ~94 us of pipeline drain -- 50 queued full-size axpy kernels went from
0.566 to 0.660 ms/iteration with a single trailing ``int(status[0].item())``.
That is the small half of the cost.  The large half is that a blocking read is
a HOST BRANCH OVER DEVICE DATA, and a host branch over device data means the
step's launch sequence is a function of the VALUES in the arrays.  While that
is true no CUDA graph can be captured (capture refuses the transfer outright)
and, more fundamentally, no cache key computable on the host can be correct,
because the host cannot see what the branch saw.

So this module does not merely make the reads cheaper.  It is what makes the
step's topology a function of the clock, which is the precondition
:mod:`tilestream.graphcap` rests on.


HOW THE DEFERRAL WORKS, AND WHAT IT COSTS
-----------------------------------------
A :class:`HealthLedger` owns a small uint32 device buffer, one slot per site.
``record`` ORs the site's status word into its slot -- a device-to-device
operation, capturable, and commutative, so many steps (or many TILES) can
accumulate into one slot without ordering.  ``drain`` reads the whole buffer
in ONE copy at a synchronisation the caller already pays for, and raises the
same exception the blocking site would have raised, built by the same closure.

What changes for a HEALTHY run: nothing.  Not the arithmetic, not the field
bytes, not the number of steps.  The gate proves it.

What changes for a SICK run: the failure is reported later -- at the next
drain rather than inside the step -- so the model executes more work before it
aborts.  The exception type and the offending field name are preserved; the
message says when it was detected, because a report that pretends to be
instantaneous when it is not is worse than a late one.  This is the same
trade-off the codebase already accepted when it replaced per-substep mass-flux
readbacks with :class:`~woof.core.dycore.MassFluxAccumulator`.

OPT-IN, AND WHY
---------------
With no ledger installed, every site behaves EXACTLY as before: it reads its
status word and raises immediately.  The deferral only happens inside
:func:`deferring`, which the tiled driver enters around a step and leaves at
the sweep's synchronisation point.  A production run that has not asked for it
keeps instantaneous detection, and the diff to each scheme is one call that is
a no-op unless a ledger is active.

DRAIN OR IT DID NOT HAPPEN
--------------------------
A ledger that is recorded into and never drained silently converts a fatal
error into no error at all.  :meth:`HealthLedger.close` therefore drains, and
:func:`deferring` closes on the way out, including on an exception path.  The
one API that can lose a failure is calling :meth:`record` outside any drain,
which is why ``record`` is not public API and the sites reach it through
:func:`read_status`.
