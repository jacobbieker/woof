"""Whole-slab CuPy execution of Noah-MP's WATER subtree.

:mod:`woof.core.noahmp_water_gpu` already evaluates every land column in one
``k_water`` launch, but it gets there through a Python loop: one bound
argument dict per column, one row of slice assignments per column, and on the
way back one :class:`~woof.core.noahmp_water.WaterFluxes` and one mutated
:class:`~woof.core.noahmp_snow.SnowColumn` per column.  At d04 that loop is
the cost -- the launch is not.  This module is the same packing with the
column axis vectorised: the caller hands over whole-slab CuPy arrays and the
Python that runs is proportional to the number of *fields* -- fifty-two, see
:data:`FIELD_NAMES` -- and not to the number of columns.

Nothing here computes physics.  ``k_water`` is used unchanged, and every
layout constant is *imported* from :mod:`woof.core.noahmp_water_gpu` rather
than restated, so the two packers cannot drift apart in slot order: they are
reading the same dictionaries.  What this module adds is the assignment, and
that is exactly what ``tests/test_noahmp_water_slab.py`` compares bit for bit
against the per-column packer.

The ``fields`` mapping
----------------------
Keys are the names :func:`woof.core.noahmp_water_gpu._bind_call` produces --
that is, ``CALL_NAMES`` -- with three flattenings:

* the ``SnowColumn`` arrives as its own attributes (``isnow``, ``snowh``,
  ``sneqv``, ``snice``, ``snliq``, ``stc``, ``zsnso``, ``dzsnso``, ``sh2o``,
  ``sice``) rather than as an object;
* the ``parameters`` handle arrives as the values named in ``P_LAYER`` and
  ``P_SCALAR``, plus ``urban_flag`` and ``nroot``, which are the only two the
  packer reads into the integer row;
* ``parameters`` and ``col`` themselves are therefore not keys.

A per-column scalar has shape ``(n,)``; a per-column vector has shape
``(n, width)`` with the **layer axis last** -- ``(n, NSOIL)``, ``(n, NSNOW)``
or ``(n, NFULL)`` as :data:`FLOAT_FIELDS` and :data:`INT_FIELDS` say.  Widths
are checked, because a ``(n, NSOIL)`` array silently broadcast into an
``(n, NFULL)`` destination is a wrong forecast, not an exception.

Contiguity
----------
A CuPy raw-kernel argument carries a device pointer and nothing else -- no
shape, no strides.  Handing ``k_water`` a strided view therefore does not
fail; it reads the wrong words.  Two rules follow, and both are tested:

* every array passed to the launch is ``cupy.ascontiguousarray``;
* every array *returned* is ``cupy.ascontiguousarray`` too, because the
  natural spelling of an output column, ``out[:, slot]``, is a strided view
  and the caller's next step is usually another raw kernel.

Return order
------------
:func:`pack_water_slab` returns ``(par, fin, iin)`` -- deliberately the same
triple, in the same order, as
:func:`~woof.core.noahmp_water_gpu.pack_water_calls`.  Two functions that
pack the identical layout must not disagree about which one comes first; that
is precisely the transposition this lane keeps getting bitten by.

``etrani``
----------
Left out, as in the per-column path.  WRF's WATER computes it as a local,
``NOAHMP_SFLX`` never reads it, and the device row does not carry it.  It is
named in :data:`ABSENT_OUTPUTS` so a caller that expects it gets a missing
key rather than a recomputed second implementation of something nothing
consumes.
