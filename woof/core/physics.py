"""WRF-ordered non-timesplit physics driver.

The driver calls radiation, MM5 surface layer, Noah LSM, YSU PBL, and
cumulus in WRF order before RK3.  Physical tendencies are computed once,
converted from A-grid uncoupled rates to the dry-mass-coupled ARW
slow-tendency form, and held fixed across all three RK stages.  This follows
WRF v4.6.1
``solve_em.F``, ``module_first_rk_step_part1.F``,
``module_em.F:calculate_phy_tend`` and
``module_physics_addtendc.F:phy_bl_ten``.

``radt_minutes``, ``cudt_minutes``, and ``bldt`` use WRF minutes and zero
means every model step.  Each slot follows its own WRF driver predicate:
radiation uses the default-offset ``MOD(ITIMESTEP, STEPRA) == 1`` calendar,
while cumulus and surface/PBL use ``MOD(ITIMESTEP, STEP*) == 0``.  Every
driver also calls on the first step and when its interval is one step.

Cumulus results that carry ``nca_seconds`` additionally follow WRF's
Kain-Fritsch driver persistence (Task 6b): each column holds its stored
tendencies, RAINCV, and PRATEC while its NCA timer has time remaining
(``module_cu_kfeta.F:410-440``), RAINC accumulates ``PRATEC*DT`` on every
model step, and the timer decrements by DT per step with the stored
tendencies cleared near expiry (``solve_em.F:3558-3571`` ->
``module_physics_addtendc.F:2139-2231``).

    The frozen numerator and total-precipitation denominator contain the
    same nonnegative components but associate their binary32 additions
    differently, so an all-frozen column may finish a few ULPs above one.

    For ``L`` WSM6 minor loops, each loop's total uses three additions, the
    snow pair uses one, each carrying accumulation uses ``L-1`` additions,
    and the final numerator and division use one rounding each.  With
    binary32 unit roundoff ``u=2^-24`` and

    ``delz[0]/1000*dtcld*1000`` (wdm6.cu:655-667, four roundings) where
    WSM6 accumulates pre-scaled sediment returns.  Each such rounding
    moves the numerator up by at most ``(1+u)`` and the denominator down
    by at most ``(1-u)``, so the bound widens by exactly
    ``((1+u)/(1-u))^step_scalings``; at ``step_scalings=0`` the integer
    arithmetic below is unchanged bit for bit.

    The integer arithmetic below evaluates ``floor((B-1)/ULP(1))`` exactly,
    selecting the largest representable binary32 value no greater than the
    analytic bound.  It therefore admits only WRF expression-order roundoff

    16 that would ask the scheme for ``rqr`` -- and, on a separate-ice-snow
    package, ``rqs`` -- which it does not produce.  ``cu_ntiedtke_post_run``
    forms exactly six tendency fields (``module_cu_ntiedtke.F:514-524``):
    theta, qv, qc, qi, u and v.  There is no separate rain or snow
    category, so the optional set is ``rqi`` and nothing else, and only
    where the moist package carries QI at all.

    The ice predicate is the tree's existing one rather than a new list:
    ``PBL_RQI_MICROPHYSICS`` already answers "does this package carry QI",
    and asking it twice in two different ways is how the two answers drift.

    AN EARLY RETURN, DELIBERATELY, AND THIS IS THE ONE SITE OF THE SEVEN
    THAT SITS ON A PATH GRELL-FREITAS EXECUTES (review).  The body
    below applies Kain-Fritsch's category rules to EVERY non-zero
    ``cu_physics``, so ``cu_physics = 3`` is getting ``rqr`` today.  That
    is the KF-logic-for-everyone shape catalogued in section 10 and it is
    DELIBERATE UNTOUCHED SCOPE, not an oversight: restructuring this into
    a per-scheme dispatch is tidier and is exactly how the 3 path would
    acquire an accidental difference while New Tiedtke was being landed.
    Improving Grell-Freitas underneath a live campaign is the owner's decision,
    not a side effect of this port.

    Branching above the existing body leaves the 1 and 3 paths textually
    untouched, so GF's inertness here is visible by inspection -- and is
    measured anyway, because a formula and the thing it describes agreeing
    proves they agree, not that either is right.

    FORENSIC FORM, the same one ``validate_sase_tendencies`` already
    carries, and for a reason this scheme learned from a field report
    rather than from theory.  A user on 1.5.2 lost an ERA5 run on its
    FIRST step to ``non-finite dtheta``, and that name is a false lead:
    the kernel writes ``dtheta`` from one solve whose only surface term
    is HFX (kernels/ysu.cu:480), so a non-finite HFX handed IN is
    reported as a dtheta produced OUT.  1.5 million fuzzed columns of
    finite, extreme, degenerate input never produce a non-finite rate at
    all, so when one appears an input is overwhelmingly the cause.  The
    output name alone therefore sent the reader to the PBL scheme when
    the defect was in the surface layer that fed it.  Naming the
    degenerate INPUTS is what closes that gap, and it costs nothing
    until a rate has already failed.

    WHICH output carries the poison depends on surface stability.  The
    input-poisoning sweep that found ``hfx`` was run before the sm_120
    DAZ work, so it was re-run against the shipping kernel on both
    branches, poisoning each of the 22 fixture-supplied inputs in turn:

    - STABLE (``br > 0``): the sweep's result holds exactly.  ``wstar3``
      is a literal zero (kernels/ysu.cu:177), so the surface buoyancy
      flux reaches nothing but ``rhs[0]`` (:480), and ``hfx`` is the
      UNIQUE input whose corruption surfaces as ``dtheta`` and nothing
      else.  That is the shape the field report described.
    - UNSTABLE (``br <= 0``): NO input has that signature.  The buoyancy
      flux sets the convective velocity scale (:173), which sets the
      mixed-layer diffusivity for momentum and moisture as well as heat,
      so a non-finite ``hfx`` poisons the whole column and the refusal
      names ``du``, first in launcher order.

    The producer detail below names ``hfx`` either way, which is the
    half the reader actually needs; only the output label moves.  Both
    branches are pinned in tests/test_ysu.py.

    ``status`` keeps the native single-readback path; the forensic work
    runs only on the failing branch of either path.

        microphysics driver, so Morrison must see zero raw rain/snow/ice
        rates on the expiry step.  woof advances the timer during its pre-RK
        driver call, after copying the current forcing into ``tendencies``;
        clearing these persistent copies therefore preserves current-step RK
        forcing and changes only Morrison plus the next compose.  No
        volume-rate copy is allocated.

        THE EARLY RETURN IS GONE, ON PURPOSE.  It used to read
        ``bool(self.cu_expiring.any())`` -- a host branch over device data --
        and skip the clears when nothing was expiring.  Two things were wrong
        with that and only one of them was the ~94 us the readback drains:
        the branch made the STEP'S LAUNCH SEQUENCE depend on the values in
        the arrays, so the step could not be captured as a CUDA graph and,
        worse, no host-computable cache key could ever have been correct for
        it.  The clears now run unconditionally through
        :func:`woof.core.health_ledger.masked_clear`, which writes exactly
        what ``cp.where(mask, 0, array)`` wrote -- a select-and-store with no
        arithmetic -- and, on the overwhelmingly common no-expiry step, only
        reads the (ny, nx) mask and writes nothing.  Bit-exact, cheaper than
        the ``cp.where`` it replaces even when it does fire (no full-size
        temporary), and constant-topology.

        and RIB) land in the same ``fields`` slots ``_run_sfclay`` fills,

        consumes -- lives in :mod:`woof.core.myjsfc` next to its source
        anchors.

        Bindings with their source of truth:

        * ``RIB`` is written to ``fields["br"]``.  That is WRF's own
          binding, not an analogy: the surface driver passes ``br`` as
          MYJSFC's ``RIB`` actual argument
          (module_surface_driver.F:2199,:2217), and ``_run_noah`` copies
          ``br`` into ``rib`` for Noah.
        * ``USTM``/``WSPD``/``CH`` are filled from the driver's own
          post-call block (:2226-2231): ``ustm = ust``, ``wspd =
          max(sqrt(u1^2+v1^2), 0.001)``, ``ch = chs``.
        * ``Z0BASE`` is the background roughness the Zilitinkevich fix
          reads (module_sf_myjsfc.F:733).  It is a static field seeded from
          the cold-start ZNT in :func:`initialize_physics`, never the
          working ZNT the sea branch overwrites every iteration.
        * ``PBLH`` is MYJSFC's own TKE scan (:263-277), not MIXLEN's
          (module_bl_myjpbl.F:834).  The two use different interfaces on
          purpose and WRF lets the surface layer's value stand until the
          PBL call replaces it.
        * ``ITIMESTEP`` is one-based, matching WRF's NTSD: the scheme's
          first-step branches seed USTAR, QSFC, THZ0 and QZ0.

        surface endpoint as they stood at that call.  An analysis that
        changes the lowest-level temperature or moisture therefore leaves
        the PUBLISHED 2 m fields describing the state before the analysis --
        and the next output frame carries them out as though they described
        the state after it.  The error is largest exactly where the analysis
        did the most work, which is the worst possible place for it.

        So the provider reruns HERE, between the analysis and the first
        output frame, and the provider that reruns is the one that owns the
        published value for THIS land-surface scheme: Noah's SFCDIAGS for
        scheme 2 (:data:`LAND_SURFACE_SFCDIAGS_SCHEMES`), and nothing for
        RUC or Noah-MP, whose own 2 m diagnostics are computed inside their
        LSM step and cannot be rerun without rerunning the LSM.  Scheme 2
        is spelled here as its resolved runner (``_run_noah``) rather than
        as the selector value, so a scheme renumbering cannot silently
        redirect this at a different LSM.  Returns
        True when a value was republished and False when this configuration
        has no rerunnable provider, so a caller can say which happened
        rather than assume.

        NOT a physics step: no scheme is advanced, no accumulator moves, no
        model second passes.  It republishes a diagnostic from the state
        that is already there.

        Noah updates TSK/HFX/QFX/QSFC after SFCLAY has diagnosed T2/Q2/TH2.
        WRF therefore calls SFCDIAGS after the LSM and before the PBL driver
        (module_surface_driver.F:2983-3000; module_sf_sfcdiags.F:45-72).
        woof does not expose WRF's UA_PHYS or HWRF compile-time branches, so
        this is their standard false/non-HWRF formulation used by the reference case.

        One documented divergence, on the lower bound only.  WRF's flux
        inversion ``Q2 = QSFC - QFX/(RHO*CQS2)`` (module_sf_sfcdiags.F:56)
        carries no bound at all, while Noah's own surface value
        ``QSFC = Q1/(1-Q1)`` with ``Q1 = qv(k=1) + QFX/(RHO*CHS)``
        (module_sf_noahlsm.F:795,801) is likewise unbounded.  Under downward
        moisture flux over very cold snow -- the Antarctic-plateau regime,
        where the surface is radiatively colder than the air above it and
        frost deposits -- the correction exceeds the whole vapour content of
        the lowest model level and both go negative.  A mixing ratio cannot
        be negative, and every consumer of Q2 (relative humidity, dewpoint,
        vapour-pressure deficit) needs the log of a positive number, so the
        engine cannot simply publish WRF's arithmetic here.

        WRF authored the remedy itself and left it commented out at
        module_sf_noahdrv.F:1276-1282: "prevent diagnostic ground q (q1) ...
        as happens over snow cover where the cqs2 value also becomes
        irrelevant / by setting cqs2=chs in this situation the 2m q should
        become just qv(k=1)".  Setting ``CQS2 = CHS`` makes the two
        corrections cancel exactly, leaving ``Q2 = qv(k=1)``.  That is what
        this does, and only where the published value would otherwise leave
        the physical range -- so a column whose flux inversion is meaningful
        is bit-for-bit WRF's.  WRF's two OTHER surface-diagnostic
        implementations bound the same quantity for the same reason

        The call cadence, the surface-layer coupling set, the mass

        the partition functions, the prescribed-profile nonlocal
        transport, the TKE diagnostic chain -- lives in
        :mod:`woof.core.shinhong` next to its source anchors.

        Scheme-specific bindings, each with its source of truth:

        * ``psim``/``psih`` receive the FULL similarity denominators
          ``fm``/``fh`` exactly as YSU's seam does: the scheme
          reconstructs zol as ``br*fm^2/fh`` from them
          (module_bl_shinhong.F:751-780, transcribed at
          woof/verify/shinhong_ref.py:735-737), the same construction
          WRF's PBL driver feeds both YSU-family wrappers.
        * ``corf`` is ``state.f``, the per-column Coriolis parameter
          2*Omega*sin(lat) at mass points -- the SAME field the
          dycore's Coriolis+curvature kernel consumes
          (woof/core/dycore.py add_coriolis_curvature; filled by
          DomainState.set_map_coriolis, zeros on idealized runs).  The
          scheme reads it only through ``f = max(corf, eps1)``
          (module_bl_shinhong.F:2001, kernel :453), so the idealized
          zero lands on WRF's own eps1 floor.
        * ``tke`` is ``state.e_sgs``, the scheme's own published SGS
          TKE fed back as next step's ``tke_in`` -- and after the
          launch the validated ``out["tke"]`` is written back to
          ``state.e_sgs``, which is the field the D1 gray-zone
          instrument scores and the restart stream carries.
        * ``tke_diag=1`` always: the dispatch-row note documents why
          the WRF namelist knob is not imported (the chain is a
          passenger diagnostic; tendencies never read it).
        * ``dx``/``dy`` are the run's own spacings -- the whole point
          of the scheme is that the answer moves with sqrt(dx*dy), so

        The scheme is WRF v4.7.1's CAMUWPBL (woof/core/uwpbl.py).  Like
        MYJ it does its own implicit diffusion and returns finished
        tendencies, so what is left here is WRF's binding of the call
        (module_pbl_driver.F:1937-1956) and the PBL slot's mass coupling.

        Bindings, each with its source of truth:

        * ``DT`` is the MODEL step, not the PBL interval: WRF passes
          ``DT=dt`` to this scheme where the YSU family gets ``DT=dtbl``
          (module_pbl_driver.F:1937 against :1186).
        * ``ITIMESTEP`` is the domain's one-based step, reconstructed the
          way :meth:`compute` does; its value 1 is the scheme's first-step
          reset of the diffusivities and the residual stress.
        * ``P_PHY``/``P8W`` are the hydrostatic ``p_hyd``/``p_hyd_w`` and
          ``Z``/``Z_AT_W`` phy_prep's heights, ``z = 0.5*(z_at_w(k) +
          z_at_w(k+1))`` (module_big_step_utilities_em.F:4869, :4893).
        * ``RHO`` is phy_prep's ``1./alt*(1.+qv)`` IN THAT ORDER
          (module_big_step_utilities_em.F:4856): two roundings, which is not
          the ``(1+qv)/alt`` the shared atmosphere carries.  The scheme reads
          it once, in the surface stress ``rho*ust*ust/|V1|``.
        * ``RTHRATENLW`` and ``CLDFRA`` are the radiation step's held
          arrays; ``CLDFRA_OLD_MP`` and ``WSEDL3D`` belong to CAMMGMP
          microphysics, which WOOF does not have, so ``is_CAMMGMP_used``
          is false and WSEDL3D is WRF's zero.
        * ``QNC_CURR`` is passed as zero: the scheme diffuses the liquid
          number as its own constituent and discards the result (no
          RQNCBLTEN leaves camuwpbl, driver.F:732-736), and no other
          constituent's solve reads it, so its value cannot reach an
          output.  ``QNI_CURR`` is the scheme's ice number where the
          microphysics carries WRF's P_QNI (woof.config.
          UW_PBL_ICE_NUMBER_SPECIES) and WRF's zero dummy slot otherwise;
          RQNIBLTEN is coupled onto that species only.

        Sequence per due surface/PBL step (positive cadence holds the
        coupled tendencies between calls):

        1. Destagger the C-grid winds to A-grid WORK COPIES -- the
           atmosphere dict's u/v are read again by cumulus after this
           slot, so SASE never mutates them; w averages to half levels.
        2. n2 from the model theta profile: N^2 = (g/theta)*d(theta)/dz
           on the SAME clamped per-column-dz stencil every SASE vertical
           operator uses (launch_n2; authority ``brunt_vaisala_n2`` is
           the pinned discrete form).  SASE-M1 (S4-2): n2_eff =
           launch_moist_n2 beside it -- the DK82 saturated N^2_m where
           the registered binary switch fires, the dry bits verbatim
           elsewhere (authority ``moist_n2``); the step receives BOTH
           (``n2_moist=n2_eff`` for the three substitution points, dry
           ``n2`` for the w-sensor screen).  SASE-M1b (S4-3c): the
           same pair also drives the moist master-length limb inside
           the step's vertical channel (launch_sase_step passes
           ``n2_dry=n2`` down exactly when the seam is engaged) -- no
           additional driver field or call.  ``cfg.sase_moist_n2``
           (default True = the model as built) gates the seam: False
           passes ``n2_moist=None`` so the step uses the DRY field at
           all three substitution points and forms no M1b bound, while
           the moist field is still computed for the M2 vent's
           saturation veto (step 5) -- M1 off, M2 standing.
        3. The named surface source (:func:`sase_surface_e_source`)
           deposits ``dt*source`` into the lowest ``e_sgs`` level BEFORE
           the fused step, so this interval's dissipation/clip acts on
           it (the source is non-negative, so the E_MIN floor holds).
        4. ``launch_sase_step`` advances the work winds and
           ``state.e_sgs`` in place through the S3-6c SPLIT scheme
           (authority ``sase_split_step``): domain-level solve

           the representative spacing dz_rep = FP64 mean layer
           thickness (carry-forward 4); the explicit HORIZONTAL stress
           divergence plus the implicit backward-Euler K_v vertical
           channel (per-column FP64 Thomas) run on the per-column
           ``dz_col`` = the model's live layer thicknesses; delta =
           sqrt(dx*dy), the horizontal filter scale of the L1
           sensor/solve operators (they are horizontal-scale operators,
           spec 4.1); the S3-6f partition bounds run inside the step
           (bulk-Richardson z_i from the model's own u/v/theta columns
           -> Delta/z_i cap; N^2-screened w-based resolved-fraction
           bound riding the SAME n2 field passed for the stability
           length -- f_used = min(f_solved, f_cap, f_w), diagnostics
           in the retained ledger); under damp_opt == 3 the config's
           zdamp engages
           the S3-6e damping-layer production taper (weight law shared
           with the audited KDH damper); S3-6j: the live sfclay ``ust``
           field drives the IMPLICIT surface momentum stress inside
           the step's u/v Thomas solves (drag conductance
           u*^2/max(|V1|, SFC_WSPD_FLOOR) folded into the bottom
           diagonal -- the YSU linearization; authority module
           docstring, S3-6j section), closing the missing-friction
           hole where ust fed only the step-3 e source; S3-9c: the
           live sfclay ``wspd`` field (the gust-enhanced speed u*
           was computed against) rides beside ust, multiplying the
           conductance by the audited YSU gustiness factor
           (spd1/wspd)^2 (authority module docstring, S3-9c
           section) so gust-inflated u* is not applied at full
           strength against the resolved wind.  The returned
           ``kv`` and
           ``km_h`` fields (popped from the ledger) are the vertical
           and governed-horizontal diffusivities the scalar channel
           rides.

           for theta, qv, qc, qi -- IN THAT ORDER: horizontal K_h
           down-gradient mixing via launch_scalar_mix riding the split
           step's exported GOVERNED diffusivity field as K_h =
           km_h/Pr_t(f) (S3-6e: the identical K the momentum stress
           and e-transport used, at the post-surface-deposit e^n --
           flux-consistent by construction, superseding the Task-6
           pre-step-e kh_coef convention, which survives only as the
           CPU-shim seam fallback), then the implicit K_v/Pr_t(f)
           vertical solve of s* = s + dt*T_h on the step's own ``kv``
           field (the same K_v/Pr_t(f) the split step's buoyancy term
           used), rate = (s_new - s)/dt.  S3-11b: the theta and qv
           rows of that solve carry the SURFACE SCALAR-FLUX DEPOSIT
           (authority ``surface_scalar_flux_deposit``, registered
           SFC_SCALAR_FLUX = "explicit-deposit-v1") -- the live
           sfclay HFX/QFX applied to the lowest layer,
           theta*[0] += dt*HFX/(rho1*CP_AIR*thick_0) and
           qv*[0] += dt*QFX/(rho1*thick_0), fused into the bottom rhs
           BEFORE the sweep at the SAME fresh fluxes the step-3 e
           source consumes and the SAME rho1 (computed once,
           ``sase_surface_rho1``); qc/qi rows take no deposit and the
           seam is off only where the fluxes are zero (in-kernel
           guard, no config flag).  SASE-M2 (S4-5, spec C1-C3): the
           theta/qv/qc rows ALSO carry the CONDITIONAL VENTING
           deposit -- the diagnosed shallow mass-flux limb's
           face-registered profiles (authority ``plume_vent_flux``,
           launched here as ``launch_plume_vent_flux`` from the FROZEN
           pre-step state at the step's used f) deposited in flux form,
           phi*[k] += (Fs[k] - Fs[k+1])*dt/(rho1*thick_k), on the
           pre-solve state BEFORE the sweep, under the registered
           cap-family uniform rescale Fs = s*F (authority
           ``vent_deposit_rescale``, enforced at this seam and nowhere
           else).  F[0] = F[nz] = +0.0, so the scalar ledger extends
           with a ZERO net-column term and the surface flux stays owned
           by the S3-11a deposit above (double-counting ban).  Nothing
           enters ``sase_split_step`` and no Thomas row moves.  qi takes
           no vent deposit (authority scope).  Pr_t(f) is the S3-6g
           regime-blended Prandtl number (authority prandtl_blend)
           at the step's used f -- recomputed here from the retained
           ledger f, identical to the step's exported pr_t
           diagnostic.  Scope is plan-bound
           decision 2: moist scalars qv/qc/qi mix, number
           concentrations and qr do NOT (parity with YSU); the
           legacy CPU-shim fallback (no ``kv`` in the ledger) has no
           vertical solve and therefore no deposit row -- S4-5b Item 4c:
           it therefore does not DIAGNOSE the limb either (it used to
           launch the flux and cap-scale kernels and discard their
           output silently), and a RuntimeError after the scalar loop
           enforces that every diagnosed row was deposited.
        6. Dissipative heating: ``heat`` (m2 s-2 accumulated over dt,
           = the S3-6d EXACT analytic decay decrement
           e* - e*/(1 + b*dt)^2 minus clip_gain, plus the S3-6e smag
           bypass and taper redirect) deposits into internal
           energy through the theta tendency,
           dtheta += heat/(dt*cp*exner) -- the spec-4.2 "existing
           heating pathway" (same slot as h_diabatic-style theta
           rates).  S3-6f doc fix: since S3-6e ``heat`` is NOT
           pointwise sign-definite -- the smag bypass share P_h,heat
           inherits the horizontal pairing's local sign (backscatter
           cells), beside the rare source-driven floor cells -- exactly
           as the restated ledger defines it (authority module
           docstring); domain sums stayed positive in every suite
           fixture.
        7. couple_ysu_tendencies mass-couples/staggeres u, v, theta,
           qv, qc, qi exactly like YSU's rates; the w rate couples
           through :func:`couple_sase_w_tendency` and rides the pbl
           stack as the plain ``rw`` attribute (restart-REBUILT:
           replaced here every step before any read; never a serialized
           dataclass field, so the restart inventory is unchanged).

        STABILITY -- RESOLVED by S3-6b/6c (implicit vertical).  History
        (S3-6 review, kept for the record): the v0 SASE diffusion was
        fully explicit with the viscosity on the horizontal scale
        (nu ~ 0.3*delta*sqrt(e) at f = 0), so the vertical-diffusion
        number 2*nu*dt/dz1^2 was unbounded on coarse-Delta domains with
        thin lowest layers (d01: delta = 12 km, dz1 ~ 50 m, dt = 60 s
        -> O(10^2) once the surface source spins sqrt(e) up to ~1).
        The fix landed at the FORMULATION level exactly as required:
        the vertical channel now rides K_v = C_KV*l_v*sqrt(e) on the
        Blackadar length (S3-6h: further bounded in the RANS limb by
        the BL89 displacement lengths and the retained l_s; S3-6i:
        the RANS limb's coefficient decouples to the stable-limit
        C_KS where l_s binds, K_v -> C_KS*e/N -- the authority module
        docstring's S3-6h/S3-6i sections) and every vertical
        diffusion (momentum, e,
        scalars) advances backward-Euler through unconditionally stable
        M-matrix Thomas columns -- no vertical CFL bound exists; the
        explicit horizontal channel keeps its own 13x CFL margin at d01
        scale (authority test derivations).

        Registered approximations (controller ledger, 2026-07-20):
        (1) [RESOLVED by S3-6g] the fixed PR_T = 1/3 put the
        RANS-regime vertical scalar channel at K_v/PR_T ~ 3*kappa*u**z
        vs the observed ~1.2*kappa*u**z -- the smoke-c inversion-
        mixdown/wind-amplification root cause; the blended Pr_t(f)
        gives K_v/PR_RANS ~ 1.18*kappa*u**z at f = 0 (inside the
        observed band) while the LES limit keeps PR_LES.
        (2) The one-constant closure's equilibrium e ~ 1.05*u*^2 sits
        ~3-5x below the observed 3.3-5.5*u*^2 (sqrt(e) ~2x low),
        biasing l_s, horizontal K, buoyancy flux, and TKE products --
        still open; BLOCKS scientific claims about TKE magnitudes
        until revisited (validation-stage carry).

        Specified-boundary policy (registered adjudication, S3-6
        review): after the fused step, ``e_sgs`` is held at the E_MIN
        floor across the outer ``spec_bdy_width`` rows on all four
        lateral edges (the width covers the widest 4-cell test-filter
        halo, so the periodic-wrap contamination of the SASE horizontal
        operators never reaches the interior through e); the same width
        is excluded from the domain-level solve reductions
        (``exclude_boundary_width``); the coupled tendencies were
        already boundary-masked by the coupling helpers.  A nested child
        takes the same policy: its lateral edges are no more periodic
        than a specified domain's, and with a zero width its test
        filters would wrap the far edge's air into the near edge's
        subgrid energy and the solve would average those wrapped cells.
        The coupling helpers already mask ``specified or nested`` alike
        (WRF's add_a2a bounds), so the e floor now matches them.

      0``), so the buffer allocated here is scratch: the scheme
      overwrites the whole field on its first radiation call, exactly as
      WRF's radiation driver zeroes ``GLW`` at the top of every call

      :data:`DECLARED_CONSTANT_GLW_WM2` because that is the value 1.8.7
      allocated, and a healthy run must stay byte-for-byte what it was.
    * ``"declared"`` -- the CALLER typed a value or handed a field.  An
      idealised column that wants a fixed longwave says so here; a route
      with a source GLW passes the source's array here.
    * ``"unused"`` -- nothing reads the buffer and nothing publishes it:
      no land-surface scheme to consume it, and radiation entirely off so
      no ``GLW`` row reaches wrfout.

    Anything else is a run that will CONSUME or PUBLISH a downward
    longwave that no scheme computed and no caller declared, and it is
    refused rather than filled.

    WHAT WRF v4.6.1 DOES with the same selectors, because the standing
    rule is to implement the defined behaviour rather than reproduce a
    bug, and here WRF is defined in both branches:

    * ``ra_lw_physics = 0`` with ``ra_sw_physics > 0``: FATAL.
      ``radiation_driver`` returns early only when BOTH are zero
      (``:1068``), so a shortwave-only run reaches ``lwrad_select``
      (``:1839``), which has no ``CASE (0)`` -- it falls to ``CASE
      DEFAULT`` (``:2245``) and calls ``wrf_error_fatal('The longwave
      option does not exist: lw_physics = 0')``.  The reciprocal
      pairing is fatal too: ``swrad_select``'s ``CASE (0)`` at ``:2827``
      calls ``wrf_error_fatal`` for every ``lw_physics`` except
      Held-Suarez (``:2831-2835``), so WRF permits a single stream only
      for that one idealised case.  woof refusing this pairing is
      WRF-CONFORMANT, not a divergence.
    * ``ra_lw_physics = 0`` with ``ra_sw_physics = 0``: the driver
      returns at ``:1068`` and ``GLW`` keeps its Registry-allocated
      0.0 W m-2, which every land-surface scheme then consumes as a real
      flux.  woof does NOT copy that: zero downward longwave is not a
      physical atmosphere, it is an absent one, and a column run under it
      cools without bound.  woof's divergence is to require the constant
      to be DECLARED -- documented here and named in the run receipt --
      instead of inheriting either WRF's 0.0 or 1.8.7's silent 300.0.

    Inputs accept scalars or arrays broadcastable to ``(ny,nx)``; soil
    inputs accept scalars, four-element profiles, or ``(4,ny,nx)`` arrays.
    ``landmask`` is WPS 1=land/0=water and is the authority for WRF XLAND

    ``landuse`` takes precedence for the WRF cold-start mask/category,
    roughness, surface-optics, UST, PBLH, and MAVAIL fields.

    A radiation or cumulus callable is selected by its nonzero RunConfig
    scheme ID.  Legacy ``ra_physics=4`` resolves to RTE+RRTMGP and
    ``ra_physics=90`` to the analytic clear-sky adapter.  Split
    ``ra_lw_physics=0, ra_sw_physics=1`` resolves to Dudhia shortwave, and
    ``1, 1`` to WRF's classic RRTM longwave + Dudhia shortwave pair, which
    is a COMPOSITION of the two single-stream adapters rather than a
    coupled one (:class:`woof.core.rrtm_lw.RRTMDudhiaRadiation`).
    Production adapters require
    their UTC start time and mass-grid latitude/longitude here.
    ``cu_physics=1`` resolves to the
    Kain-Fritsch adapter (:class:`woof.core.kf.KainFritsch`).  A
    scheme callable receives keyword arguments ``atmosphere``, ``fields``,
    ``state``, and ``cfg`` and must return :class:`RadiationResult` or
    :class:`CumulusResult`, respectively.

    ``glw`` HAS NO DEFAULT -- see :func:`_resolve_initial_glw`, which is
    where the argument is turned into a value or the call is refused.
    With a longwave scheme attached the buffer is a transient: WRF
    ordering runs radiation before the surface layer and the LSM, and the
    first radiation call is due at ``itimestep = 1``, so the scheme's own
    flux is in the field before anything reads it.  With
    ``ra_lw_physics = 0`` it is NOT a transient -- Dudhia hands the field
    straight back and a fully radiation-free run has no adapter at all --
    so whatever is in the buffer IS the run's entire downward longwave,
    and this function will not pick that number on the caller's behalf.
    Pass ``glw=`` explicitly to declare a fixed sky (the historical
    idealised value is :data:`DECLARED_CONSTANT_GLW_WM2`) or to hand the
    call a source's own GLW field.  A real experiment that means it also
    declares it in the config, which is what

    # WRF's mp_init, ONCE per domain, exactly where phy_init runs it:
    # module_physics_init.F:1635 calls mp_init as the last physics
    # initializer before fg_init, and mp_init's CASE (THOMPSONAERO) arm
    # (:4522-4538) calls thompson_init -- which installs the synthetic CCN/IN
    # profile whenever the water/ice-friendly aerosol fields arrive unset
    # (module_mp_thompson.F:493-514 for CCN, :531-551 for IN).
    #
    # UNCONDITIONAL by design.  microphysics_init returns an empty receipt
    # for every scheme except 28 (microphysics.py:766-771), so there is no
    # selector test to keep in sync here.
    #
    # ONCE, NOT PER STEP.  Nothing in mp_gt_driver ever refills the profile,
    # and a per-step call would overwrite an advected, activated and
    # scavenged aerosol field with the synthetic one on every step while
    # leaving every clamp and every bound intact -- silent, plausible, and
    # worse than the defect it replaces.
    #
    # PRESENCE-GATED.  thompson_init reaches its two fills only through two
    # independent domain-wide MAXVAL presence tests (:490/:493 for CCN,
    # :528/:531 for IN), which woof honours through
    # thompson_aerosol_state.aerosol_profile_needs_fill.  WRF itself calls
    # thompson_init on restart as well as on a cold start
    # (module_physics_init.F:4525: start_of_simulation .or. restart .or.
    # cycling), so in WRF that presence test -- not the call site -- is what
    # protects an aerosol-bearing domain.
    #
    # WHERE THAT MATTERS IN GPUWM, in call order:
    #   * a NEST: woof/ingest/nest_init.py interpolates nwfa/nifa/nwfa2d
    #     from the parent (its ("nwfa", "") .. ("nifa2d", "") rows) and
    #     woof/core/model.py runs initialize_child BEFORE
    #     runtime.prepare_child_case calls this function, so a child under an
    #     aerosol-bearing parent takes thompson_init's has_CCN branch
    #     (:516-522) exactly as WRF's would -- no refill, and no re-derived
    #     nwfa2d;
    #   * a RESUME: woof's order is prepare -> initialize_physics ->
    #     restore_restart, so the fill DOES run here on the all-zero cold
    #     state and restore_restart then overwrites it with the checkpointed
    #     aerosol.  The resumed run integrates the checkpoint, which is the
    #     property that matters; the receipt records what this call did, not
    #     what the run ends up with.  Both are gated in tests/test_physics.py.
    #
    # An empty receipt is simply not recorded; the property's default is {}.
