"""Drive a live ``dt`` from measured CFL -- the executor's ``on_period_steps``.

This is the wire between three things that already exist and were built
separately on purpose: the CFL reduction (``kernels/openbc.cu``
``w_cfl_stat``), the ported controller
(:mod:`woof.core.adaptive_timestep`), and the executor's varying-step
walk (``woof.core.clock.adaptive_periods``).

WHERE THE STATE LIVES, and why it is not on ``DomainState``.  Relocation
replaces the state object -- measured, a 4-hour run split one domain's
CFL series into seven segments -- so a controller kept there would reset
its ``last_dt`` on every move and silently re-run the ramp.  It is kept
here, keyed by ``grid_id``, and the LIVE step lives on
:class:`~woof.core.clock.DomainClock`, which ``nest_relocation`` only
ever reads.  That is the relocation invariant, closed
by construction rather than by remembering to copy something.

THREE THINGS MUST MOVE TOGETHER when a step changes, and two of them fail
silently if they do not:

1. ``clock.step_ticks`` -- the executor's integer calendar.
2. ``node.cfg.run.dt`` -- what the KERNELS read.  All 55 ``cfg.dt``
   readers take ``cfg`` as a parameter and read ``.dt`` at call time, so
   replacing the frozen ``RunConfig`` reaches every one of them.
3. the physics driver's ``stepra``/``stepcu`` -- computed ONCE in its
   ``__init__`` from ``cfg.dt`` (``core/physics.py:2022``).  Left alone,
   radiation and cumulus keep whatever interval they were built with: no
   error, no refusal, a slowly wrong answer, and INTERMITTENT on a moving
   nest because relocation rebuilds the driver.

The float arithmetic lives here and not in the executor: ``clock.py``'s
walk is AST-audited to be integer-only, so what crosses that boundary is
an integer number of ticks and nothing else.

        interval jitters: measured 373.06 s where the target was 358, a

    WRF freezes STEPRA in phys_init and never revisits it, so under an

      MEASURED with STEPRA frozen -- d02's step grew 6 -> 11 s, stepra
      stayed 60, and radiation went from firing every 360 s to every
      660 s.  woof's carrier gate refused it, and the gate was RIGHT:
      radiation really had become half as frequent, and a longwave flux
      that old no longer answers to the sun.  WRF does not notice because
      it has no such contract.

    So ``stepra``/``stepcu`` are re-derived from the BASELINE step, which
    holds the cadence near ``radt`` however dt moves.  Baseline rather
    than the momentary dt because a step shortened to land on an output
    frame is not a step anything else will take -- deriving a cadence
    from one gave stepra = 161 instead of 38.

    Re-asserted before EVERY solve rather than once a period, because
    relocation rebuilds the physics driver mid-period and the rebuilt one
    derives its own counts from whatever dt is current.

    THE COST is phase jitter: ``_radiation_step_due`` is
    ``itimestep % stepra == 1``, so a stepra that moves shifts when the
    next call lands, and an interval can run a few seconds long.  That is
    what ``observed`` is for -- the interval the producer was last
    measured to take, which covers the jitter exactly where a prediction
    cannot.  The caller must actually pass it: the driver used to compute
    the observation and discard it, which left the ``max(predicted,
