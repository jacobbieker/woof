"""Retirement and re-arm policy for trigger-spawned nests.

This module deliberately owns policy only.  Tree mutation remains a leg-boundary
operation in :mod:`woof.runtime`, the same schedule-surgery seam used by spawn.
A retirement decision therefore never skips a STEP op from an already-built

    ONE spelling, because the two doors that admit a follower -- the
    configuration load and the runner build -- pass it to the same
    refusals, and a subject that changed between them would read as two
    different rules to whoever met it twice.  The follower is named, not
    the file, because ``[[domain]].follow`` is the table the reader has to
    edit.  ``source`` is the file that carried it, appended where the
    caller knows it; the runner build does not, because an experiment is
    no longer a path by then.

    follow cadence the parent stash cannot serve was accepted by
    ``woof check``, accepted by a dry run, and refused only once the
    runners were being built.  The refusal itself is unchanged and so is
    the way out it names -- set ``cadence_seconds`` to a whole multiple of
    the watched parent's ``history_interval_s`` -- it simply arrives while
    the configuration is still the thing in front of the reader.  Both
