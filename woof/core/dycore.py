"""WRF-ARW RK3 split-explicit time-stepping driver.

One ``step`` advances the state by ``cfg.dt`` with the three-stage
Runge-Kutta scheme of Wicker & Skamarock (ARW Tech Note sec. 3.1.2): each
stage recomputes the slow tendencies R^t* from the latest stage estimate
(the acoustic reference state t*), then re-integrates the *time-t* fields
forward with acoustic substeps:

  stage 1:  1 substep,             dtau = dt/3
  stage 2:  ns/2 substeps,         dtau = dt/ns
  stage 3:  ns substeps,           dtau = dt/ns

with ns = ``cfg.time_step_sound``.  The slow forcings are the flux-form
advection (vertical flux = the diagnosed eta mass flux Omega, WRF
``calc_ww_cp``), the horizontal pressure gradient of the t* state (WRF
``horizontal_pressure_gradient``), the buoyancy/vertical-pressure-gradient
term g*(d(p')/d(eta) - mu') (WRF ``pg_buoy_w``) and the advective-form
geopotential RHS with its g*w term (WRF ``rhs_ph``); the perturbation
pressure-gradient and buoyancy terms live inside the acoustic substeps
(woof.core.acoustic, Tech Note eqns 3.4-3.14).

``acoustic=False`` keeps the Phase-1 advection-only transport path (mu' and
phi' frozen) used by the pure-advection verification test.

Time-step rule (WRF guidance): ``dt <= ~6 s per km of dx``; benchmarks run
at CFL ~ 0.3-0.5.

    WRF ``calc_ww_cp`` (dyn_em/module_big_step_utilities_em.F): integrate
    the continuity equation over the column for the (eta-uniform) d(mu)/dt,
    then diagnose Omega level by level from the coupled horizontal mass
    fluxes ``ru``/``rv``, weighting the column-mass tendency by the hybrid
    c1h.  Omega = 0 at the surface and at the model top: WRF sets
    ``ww(kte)`` to zero rather than trusting the column sum (which closes
    only to rounding, since sum(dnw*c1h) = -1), and so does this.

    One thread per column evaluates the routine in WRF's own arithmetic,
    every product and sum boundary where the Fortran has one:

    * the layer divergence is ``divv(k) = (msftx*dnw(k)) * (rdx*(ru(i+1) -
      ru(i)) + rdy*(rv(j+1) - rv(j)))``, the map factor and the layer
      thickness multiplied FIRST and that product applied to the bracket
      (Fortran evaluates ``msftx*dnw*(...)`` left to right);
    * the column total ``dmdt`` is the sequential sum of ``divv`` from the
      surface up, one rounding per layer, not a tree reduction;
    * the recurrence is ``ww(k) = (ww(k-1) - (dnw(k-1)*c1h(k-1))*dmdt) -
      divv(k-1)``: the level product, then the first subtraction, then the
      second, never a pre-added operand ``ww - (a + b)``.

    ``rdx``/``rdy`` are single-precision reciprocals (``rdx = 1./dx`` in
    solve_em), and multiplication commutes exactly, so the order of the two
    factors inside any one product is free; the boundaries are not.  Same
    discipline as :func:`_couple_momentum_kernel`: explicit round-to-nearest
    intrinsics plus ``-fmad=false``.  Without map factors the same kernel
    omits the factor, which is WRF with ``msftx = 1`` exactly (a multiply by
    one is exact).

    Map factors (Task 3): with ru/rv already msf-coupled, the ``msftx``
    weight makes ``ww`` the tech-note Omega = mu*deta/dt / m_y.

    Replaces the ufunc/``sum``/``cumsum`` construction: three full-size
    ufunc passes, a CuPy tree reduction and a CuPy batched scan whose
    summation orders belonged to the library (docs/public/DETERMINISM.md,
    "library-owned reduction order") and whose scan alone cost about 1.2 ms
    per call at 480x384x49 on a 5070 Ti; the per-column scan does the same
    work in about a tenth of that (GitHub issue #5, weiserhase).

    The exact inverse of :func:`add_h_diabatic_tendency`'s coupling:
    ``rth_t`` forces the WRF-coupled theta and carries an extra ``1/msfty``
    (see :func:`_add_slow_tendencies`), so the uncoupled K s-1 rate a
    cumulus scheme wants is ``rth_t * msfty / (c1h*mut + c2h)`` with the
    stage's own total dry mass ``mut``.  Same units, same one-step lag and
    the same producer/consumer split as ``h_diabatic``.

    CALL SITE IS THE CONTRACT.  This must run in the window after
    :func:`_add_slow_tendencies` returns -- where ``rth_t`` holds the flux
    divergence of theta and nothing else -- and before
    ``physics_tendencies.add_to_slow``, :func:`add_h_diabatic_tendency`,
    :func:`add_diffusion_tendencies` and the lateral-boundary fold touch
    it.  WRF's ``module_cumulus_driver.F:867`` pre-folds
    ``RTHRATEN + RTHBLTEN`` into ``RTHFTEN`` for G3SCHEME and
    NTIEDTKESCHEME and NOT for GFSCHEME, which sums the lanes itself
    (``woof/core/kernels/gf.cu:4428``), so an export taken one line later
    makes the scheme integrate the boundary layer and the radiation twice.
    ``tests/test_dycore_advective_forcing_export.py`` is the gate.

    WHAT THE NUMBER IS, precisely, because "advective tendency" is
    ambiguous and the difference is measurable: this is the flux-form
    TRANSPORT tendency of the coupled scalar divided by the stage dry
    mass, which is the quantity ``rth_t`` carries and the quantity the
    h_diabatic coupling inverts.  It differs from the material derivative
    ``-v.grad(theta)`` by the mass-divergence term
    ``theta*(dmu/dt)/mu`` -- order 1e-3 K s-1 against a measured 3e-3
    K s-1 rms on a 12 km CONUS domain, so it is a stated part of the
    export rather than a rounding detail.  Both halves of the pair use
    the same construction and the same reference mass, so the theta and
    qv rates GF sums are consistent with each other.

    ``tke_heat_flux`` heat flux with no moisture flux; isfflx=1 takes
    USTM/HFX/QFX from the surface driver; isfflx=2 takes USTM/QFX from
    the driver but the constant ``tke_heat_flux`` heat.  A surface-layer-
    free run supplies no fields and the ust-based arms stay cold-zero,
    exactly the no-writer WRF state.

    ``opt`` is ``diff_6th_opt``: 2 zeroes any up-gradient flux (monotonic),
    any other positive value is the plain operator.  ``stagger`` selects
    the grid position as in ``launch_add_diff2``: ``""`` mass points,
    ``"x"`` u, ``"y"`` v, ``"z"`` w points (BC-pinned boundary levels get

    msf-scaled ``phb`` face jump at the field's own level; ``dx``/``dy``
    must then be the physical grid spacings. ``msfu``/``msfv``/``msft``
    default to identity when omitted. The field's own map factor also
    multiplies its tendency, independently of the terrain-slope option.

    it is the SAME FACE as index 0, reached the other way round.
    ``tilestream.spec`` builds every gather, scatter and halo band on exactly
    that identity (spec.py:34-52: "gathers never read the alias slot"; under
    ``periodic=True`` the alias slot is logical face 0), and
    ``TileSpec.scatter`` writes the domain's alias slot FROM face 0 for that
    reason.

    NOTHING WAS MAINTAINING IT.  No periodic stencil writes the slot -- they
    wrap their indices instead -- so it kept whatever the initialiser left,
    which for a window of a larger analysis is the real column one past the
    window: on this case's 128-wide window, ``u[:, :, nx]`` sat 17.4 m/s away
    from ``u[:, :, 0]`` at t=0 and stayed there.

    came off that stale face, and ``physics._prepare_atmosphere``

    mass column and the top mass row of every surface-layer and PBL carrier
    were driven by a wind that is not part of the solution.  That is wrong on
    ONE GPU.

    It is also the whole of the single-vs-multi physics divergence.  A
    decomposition re-derives the slot from face 0 -- by the contract above,
    and unavoidably: the rank that holds the domain's alias slot receives it
    through the halo exchange from the rank that owns face 0 -- so the two
    arms fed different winds to the same cells and differed after ONE step,
    diffusely and nowhere near a rank seam.  MEASURED, 128x96x49, one step,
    full physics through ``MultiGPUDomain``: 61 of 158 carriers differ
    without this call, 0 with it, at 1x1, 1x2 and 2x2 alike.

    Closing it here, at the end of the step, is inert for a RANK: the halo
    exchange overwrites the tile's outermost faces before the next step, and
    the outermost mass column those faces feed is a halo column that
    ``TileSpec.scatter`` discards.  A NON-PERIODIC axis carries a real
    closing boundary face -- the specified/open lateral boundary owns it --
    and is left alone.

    """Advance ``state`` one full RK3 step of length ``cfg.dt``.

    ``acoustic=True`` (default) runs the full ARW split-explicit loop: per
    stage, zero tendencies -> EOS diagnostics at t* -> slow tendencies ->
    initialize the acoustic perturbations from the time-t fields -> acoustic
    substeps -> fold the perturbations into the new stage estimate.
    ``acoustic=False`` is the Phase-1 advection-only path (w, phi', mu'
    frozen).  ``mass_flux_observer``, when supplied, is called with each
    final-RK-stage acoustic substep's boundary-flux mass increment.  Summing
    those increments independently closes the completed step's domain-mass
    change and is otherwise a zero-cost dormant diagnostic.
    ``mass_flux_accumulator`` is the device-resident alternative (a
    :class:`MassFluxAccumulator`): it takes the same increments in the
    same order without reading any of them, so a long integration pays no
    per-substep host synchronization.  The two keywords are mutually
    exclusive and supplying both raises.
    ``refl_10cm_due`` is the history-step flag threaded to microphysics;
    the active scheme computes and stashes radar reflectivity before its
    finish-stage theta writeback and the post-microphysics EOS refresh.

    Config-gated physics (no-ops with the defaults): with ``km_opt=1``,
    constant-K diffusion joins every stage's slow tendencies when
    ``cfg.khdif/kvdif > 0``;
    ``cfg.km_opt=4`` adds the WRF 2-D Smagorinsky horizontal mixing
    (:func:`add_smag2d_tendencies` -- computed once per step on stage 1,
    applied every stage; moisture via :func:`apply_smag2d_moisture`); and
    ``damp_opt=3`` engages the Klemp-Dudhia-Hassiotis implicit w-only
    Rayleigh damper inside the acoustic w solve (woof.core.acoustic; no-op
    on the ``acoustic=False`` path, which has no acoustic substeps); and
    ``diff_6th_opt > 0`` computes WRF's 6th-order monotonic horizontal
    forward tendency once from the time-t fields and feeds that held
    tendency to every RK stage (the advection-only test path skips it).

    Moist states (Task 5): each stage's transport fluxes come from the
    public :func:`stage_fluxes` surface, and qv/qc/qr advance right after
    the stage's acoustic loop (``woof.core.moist.advance_scalars_stage``;
    PD limiter on the final stage) so the next stage's EOS sees consistent
    (theta, qv).  The advection-only path stays dry.

    Microphysics (Task 6): with ``cfg.mp_physics != 0`` the configured
    scheme (``woof.core.microphysics.apply``) adjusts theta/qv/qc/qr once
    per step after the RK3 loop -- WRF solve_em's non-timesplit
    microphysics slot -- followed by a diagnostics refresh; the default
    ``mp_physics = 0`` leaves the step bitwise unchanged.  The scheme's
    clamped theta increment is retained as ``state.h_diabatic`` (K/s, WRF
    moist_physics_finish_em) and the NEXT step feeds it to every RK
    stage's theta tendency (:func:`add_h_diabatic_tendency`, WRF
    rk_addtend_dry) while the final stage's fold removes its accumulated
    net contribution (``_finish_small_steps``, WRF small_step_finish) --
    the dynamics see the heating continuously, the state is heated once.

    Open lateral boundaries + w-damping (Task 9 + Task 11 rework, acoustic
    path only): with ``cfg.open_x``/``open_y`` the advection kernels take
    WRF's open-aware bounds, each stage ADDS the radiative term at the
    boundary-normal velocity faces (:func:`apply_open_radiative_bc`), the
    acoustic substeps skip the boundary-face pressure gradient and clamp
    their cross-boundary ghost reads, and each stage ends with the
    zero-gradient-outbound boundary values
    (:func:`apply_open_zero_gradient`).  ``cfg.emdiv > 0`` engages WRF's
    external-mode divergence damping across the acoustic substeps
    (:func:`apply_emdiv_filter`).  ``cfg.w_damping = 1`` adds WRF's
    vertical-velocity limiter per stage (:func:`apply_w_damping`).  All
    no-ops with the defaults; the ``acoustic=False`` Phase-1 test path
    stays periodic.

    Unsupported combinations fail loudly here (and, for the config-only
    parts, in ``woof.config.load_config``): terrain (``terrain_opt != 0``
    or any nonzero ``state.ht``) with radiative-open boundaries, and
    constant-K diffusion (``khdif/kvdif > 0``) with radiative-open or
    specified boundaries, raise ``NotImplementedError`` because their
    remaining stencils/bounds are periodic-only.  The non-monotonic
    ``diff_6th_opt = 1`` with moisture raises ``ValueError`` (unlimited
    fluxes bypass the PD limiter).  Coriolis/curvature is boundary-aware.

    :func:`decode_stability_record` answers "is anything non-finite" with
    one bit, because that is all its eight-word reduction can carry: its
    ``nan`` is a finiteness test on three MAXIMA (u, w, theta') and the
    record holds no field name and no index of a non-finite value.  So a
    run that blew up could say the step it happened on and nothing else
    about it, and "at step 6624" is the one sentence that tells a reader
    to go and re-run the thing to find out more.

    This is the survey taken ONCE, on the failure path, after that bit
    comes back true.  It is a full pass over the allocated carriers and
    it costs a bool temporary per field, which is why it is not on the
    per-step route: a run pays for it exactly when it is already over.

    WHAT IT CANNOT SAY, and therefore does not: where a field went
    non-finite FIRST.  The health check runs every health interval (60
    model seconds, 48 to 144 steps of a downscaled child) and reads only
    the u, w and theta' maxima, so by the time it fires the non-finite set
    has spread for up to that many steps, and a carrier the check does not
    read may have gone long before.  An earlier version reported the
    lowest memory-order index of that set as the "first" cell; in
    (k, j, i) order that is always the set's lowest level and its
    southmost row, so a plume aloft that had spread down its column was
    reported at k=0 on the south edge of its block.  The box and the count
    are what the survey actually measured, so they are what it reports.

    Returns ``{"fields": [...], "surveyed": [names]}`` with one entry per
    non-finite carrier carrying its cell count, the bounding box the
    whole set falls inside, and the lateral edges that box reaches
    (:func:`nonfinite_box_edges`) -- the numbers that distinguish one bad
    cell from a column, a column from a plume, a plume from a field that
    has gone entirely, and an interior blow-up from one at the boundary.
    A carrier with exactly one bad cell also carries that ``cell``, which
    is then a measurement rather than a choice.  A state whose carriers
    are all finite returns an empty ``fields``, which is itself a
    reading: the record said non-finite and the fields do not agree.
