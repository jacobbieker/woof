"""The RUC coupling layer: WRF's ``LSMRUC`` seam, column by column.

``module_surface_driver.F:3438-3596`` is not a bare ``CALL LSMRUC``.  The
``CASE (RUCLSMSCHEME)`` arm owns four things that live between WRF's grid
arrays and the RUC driver, and every one of them changes an answer:

* the sea-ice snow-free albedo override (:3453-3459): ``ALBBCK =
  SEAICE_ALBEDO_DEFAULT`` wherever ``XICE_THRESHOLD <= XICE <= 1``, applied
  BEFORE the call, unconditionally -- it is not inside the
  ``FRACTIONAL_SEAICE`` block;
* the argument binding itself, which is where WRF's naming traps live.  The
  driver passes ``dz8w`` into an argument named ``z3d`` and ``p_phy`` -- the
  layer-MID pressure -- into one named ``p8w`` (:3506).  Reading ``p8w`` as
  an interface pressure is a silent O(dp/2) bias in every saturation
  humidity RUC computes, because ``qsg = qsn(soilt,tbq)/(p8w*1e-2)``;
* ``GSW``, which RUC takes as the ABSORBED shortwave flux, not the
  downward one.  WRF builds it in the radiation driver as
  ``gsw = swdown*(1-albedo)`` (``module_radiation_driver.F:3660``); and
* the post-call ``CQS``/``CHS`` rebuild (:3580-3585) and
  ``SFCDIAGS_RUCLSM`` (:3587).  RUC does not use WRF's ordinary SFCDIAGS.
  It has its own 2-m diagnostic, ``module_sf_sfcdiags_ruclsm.F``, which
  clamps T2 between TSK and the first level, builds Q2 from a QSFC PROXY
  reconstructed out of QFX rather than from QSFC itself, and saturation-caps
  the result.  Substituting Noah's SFCDIAGS here would be exactly the
  "plausible numbers, wrong scheme" failure that
  :data:`woof.core.physics.LAND_SURFACE_SFCDIAGS_SCHEMES` exists to prevent,
  so RUC is deliberately absent from that set and this module carries its
  own.

So this module is that seam, with the anchors next to the arithmetic.  The
driver below it is :func:`woof.core.ruc.ruc_land_surface_step`, which is
``LSMRUC`` itself (``phys/module_sf_ruclsm.F:84-1175``) and is oracle-matched
against the byte-unmodified module.

Where the column runs
---------------------
On the CARD, in FP32.  :func:`ruc_lsm_step` runs :mod:`woof.core.ruc_fused`:
six full-width kernels per deterministic call (the WRF surface-driver seam and
LSMRUC's
prologue, the three ``sfctmp`` stages, the epilogue with SFCDIAGS, and a
commit that writes the fields only when no check failed), one read of the
flag words at the end, and SFCDIAGS's two power expressions on the host,
through glibc's ``powf`` on every host (:func:`sfcdiags_exner_powers`).
Enabled ``spp_lsm=1`` uses the retained device-resident orchestration
with the historical WRF hydraulic operator between soil-property and moisture
transport calls; its arrays remain on the GPU. The disabled fused path is
unchanged. The ``sfctmp`` stages are generated from the array
orchestration by ``tools/ruc_fused/gen_sfctmp.py`` and call ``ruc.cu``'s
leaves as device functions, so the column arithmetic has one source.

:func:`_ruc_lsm_step_reference` keeps that orchestration (the masked
``sfctmp`` dispatch over :data:`woof.core.ruc_gpu.RUC_SFCTMP_DEVICE_LEAVES`
with the prologue and epilogue as whole-axis array code) as the oracle every
output word of the fused call is tested against, call after call, at both
soil geometries (``tests/test_ruc_lsm_fused.py``,
``tests/test_ruc_sfctmp_fused.py``).  There is no switch that selects the
host leaf set: it exists for the oracle suite, which runs on a machine with
no card, and a forecast that quietly took it would be a thousand times
slower with no signal that it had.  ``tests/test_ruc_runtime.py`` gates the
import edge directly so it cannot rot back.

The published option identity
-----------------------------
:data:`woof.config.RUC_OPTION_IDENTITY` is the enforced part -- one accepted
value per namelist knob, refused by ``validate_run_config`` before a run
starts.  :data:`RUC_RUNTIME_RESTRICTIONS` is the rest: every restriction the
identity schema has no field for.  The first entry is the one a user is most
likely to be bitten by and is not a namelist knob at all -- it is a
compile-time branch of WRF that woof's own core would have taken.

    reason RUC must not borrow it.  T2 is CLAMPED into ``[min(TSK,T1),
    max(TSK,T1)]``, so an unstable column cannot diagnose a 2-m temperature
    outside the pair that bracket it.  Q2 is built from a QSFC PROXY --
    ``qlev1 + QFX/(RHO*CQS)`` -- rather than from QSFC, which the comment at
    ``:97-99`` says is deliberate for densely vegetated columns; it is then
    clamped between QSFCmr and qlev1 and saturation-capped at T2.
