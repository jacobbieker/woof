"""Moisture: positive-definite scalar transport and moist thermodynamics.

Transport (WRF ``module_advect_em.F`` ``advect_scalar_pd``; Skamarock 2006
MWR; ``moist_adv_opt=1``): qv/qc/qr are dry-mass-coupled scalars advected
through all three RK3 stages with WRF's acoustic-substep TIME-AVERAGED
mass fluxes ru_m/rv_m/ww_m (``sumflux``, module_small_step_em.F:1473 --
"needed for consistent mass-conserving scalar advection";
solve_em.F:2210-2212), accumulated by ``dycore.step`` as the substep mean
of the perturbation momenta/Omega'' plus the stage-reference fluxes from
:func:`woof.core.dycore.stage_fluxes`.  Theta and momentum keep the
stage fluxes exactly as WRF's ``rk_tendency`` does; moisture never
re-derives Omega (Task 5 retired the ``rw = -(mu*w)`` placeholder in
advection.py).
Stages 1-2 use the unlimited 5th/3rd-order flux divergence
(advection.py/advection.cu); the RK3 FINAL stage only -- exactly as WRF
applies its PD filter -- decomposes every face flux as ``F = F_upwind1 +
F_corr`` and renormalizes the outgoing corrections of any cell they would
overdraw (kernels/pd_advection.cu: ``pd_fluxes`` + ``pd_renorm_apply``;
float64 mirrors ``np_pd_fluxes``/``np_pd_renorm_apply`` in
woof.verify.npref).

The renormalization is exactly positive in exact arithmetic; the final
stage update clamps FP32 rounding residuals (order 1 ulp of the
renormalized outflow, in cells the limiter already drove to ~0) at zero,
which perturbs total scalar mass far below the 1e-6 relative conservation
gate.

Thermodynamics (ARW Tech Note ch. 2; dry-theta prognostic, WRF
``use_theta_m=0`` style): the EOS diagnostics use ``theta_m = theta *
(1 + Rv/Rd*qv)`` (diagnostics.cu; the ratio comes from the constants), the
w-equation buoyancy takes WRF's full moist ``pg_buoy_w`` form -- the
``1/(1+q_tot)`` factor on the vertical p' gradient plus the hydrometeor/
vapor loading ``-q_tot/(1+q_tot)*(c1f*mub+c2f)`` with ``q_tot = qv+qc+qr``
(dycore._add_slow_tendencies) -- and the acoustic coefficients pick up
theta_m through the moist pressure in ``c2a = gamma*p/alpha``.  The
linearized-EOS ratios ``(mu*theta)''/theta_ref`` remain invariant under the
per-cell ``(1 + Rv/Rd*qv)`` factor while qv is frozen over the substeps.

The acoustic path also matches WRF ``calc_cq`` each RK stage: ``cqu`` and
``cqv`` scale the horizontal acoustic pressure gradients, while ``cqw``
scales the implicit vertical pressure coefficients and forcing.  The sum
contains every active WRF ``moist`` mass species (qv/qc/qr and, for
mixed-phase schemes, qi/qs/qg), never their number-moment ``scalar`` fields.
RunConfig's
default-ON ``moist_cq`` switch exists only for falsification attribution;
it is not a science-tuning option and production configurations leave it
enabled.  A dry state has no qv allocation and stays on the exact legacy
kernel expressions without cq scratch or launch work.

External aerosol forcing follows the supplied table inventory. WRF
solve_em.F:2803-2839 captures aerosol spec/relax tendencies on RK stage 1
when aer_init_opt>0; :2904-2930 excludes those fields from flow-dependent
zero inflow. The input producer's selected aerosol fields are retained in
coupled snapshots and wrfbdy tables.  The analysed hydrometeor masses a
source publishes, and the number moments the cold start seeds from them,
are specified the same way where the table carries them (WRF
have_bcs_moist / have_bcs_scalar, solve_em.F:2265-2267, :2346, :2812-2815;
woof.boundary_fields).  Unsupplied number moments keep their
flow-dependent boundary treatment.

    update clamps FP32 rounding residuals at zero (module docstring).

    Boundary routing: stages 1-2 use the open-aware ``flux_div_scalar``
    path (Task 11 prerequisite) like theta.  Under SPECIFIED BCs the
    final PD stage runs with WRF's specified bounds in pd_advection.cu
    (advect_scalar_pd, module_advect_em.F:7697-7715) -- the production
    the reference case path.  Radiative-OPEN domains keep the unlimited final stage
    plus clamp: WRF's advect_scalar_pd DOES support open BCs (it carries
    its own non-cb open radiation blocks, module_advect_em.F:7266-7330),
    but woof's PD kernels do not implement those blocks -- an accepted,
    documented woof deviation.  On the PD final stage the
    accumulated stage-1 forward tendencies, physics tendencies, AND qv's
    held lateral spec+relax tendency are folded into the time-t scalar
    BEFORE the limiter (WRF
    rk_update_scalar_pd; ``_pd_fold_sources``) so the renormalization
    budget sees the sources.  The held qv LBC tendency is captured once
    per model step on the first stage from the time-t state (WRF
    moist_tend, solve_em.F:2255-2292) and enters every stage's update --
    relax rows additively, spec rows replacing the advective tendency;
    the spec rows are subsequently overwritten by
    ``apply_state_boundary_values`` exactly as in WRF.

    ``export_advective_forcing`` (the dycore passes ``istage == 0``) writes
    the qv half of the cumulus advective forcing pair, WRF's ``RQVFTEN``,
    from the untouched flux divergence -- see
    :func:`_capture_advective_qv_forcing`.  It is a SECOND hook site from
    theta's, not a duplicate: theta advects with the RK stage reference
    fluxes and qv with the acoustic time-averaged ones, so the two rates
    are captured where their own fluxes are.  The final PD stage cannot
    serve: its tendency is the advection of a source-folded scalar
    (``_pd_fold_sources``), which is no longer pure advection.

    ``implicit`` is ``rk_scalar_tend``'s IEVA split ``(wwE, wwI)`` of
    ``ww`` (``zadvect_implicit = 1``, last substep): every explicit
    operator, the PD limiter included, advects with ``wwE``, and each
    species' advective tendency is then replaced by its column solve
    against ``wwI`` from the time-t scalar the update starts from
    (``advect_s_implicit``, module_em.F:1346-1364), before the msf
    coupling, the lateral fold and the specified-ring exclusion.

    :2100-2119 under tke_adv_opt=1), with the once-per-step forward
    source (tke_rhs + self-diffusion, held in ``smag_rtke``) folded on
    every stage and into the PD budget on the final stage.

    Two WRF steps follow every ``rk_update_scalar`` pass, in this order
    (solve_em.F:2432-2451):

    * ``bound_tke`` (module_em.F:2490-2520) clamps the carrier into
      ``[0, tke_upper_bound]`` over the whole mass grid -- on EVERY domain
      including doubly periodic ones, and on EVERY RK stage, not just the
      final one.  It replaces the plain zero clamp the moist rows use.
    * ``flow_dep_bdy`` (module_bc.F:2335-2456) fills the specified zone of
      a ``specified``/``nested`` domain from the flow direction: zero on
      inflow, zero-gradient from the first interior row/column on outflow.
      That is the WHOLE lateral-boundary treatment WRF gives TKE -- the
      Registry row (EM_COMMON:312) has no ``b`` flag, so no wrfbdy stream
      carries TKE and there is no spec/relax forcing to apply, and no
      ``i``/``f`` flag, so nests neither inherit nor feed it back.
      Radiative-open domains get no extra arm in WRF either: the open
      radiation lives in the advection operator and in ``set_physical_bc3d``,
      both already routed through ``launch_flux_div_scalar``'s ``open_x``/
      ``open_y`` and the diffusion tendencies' open-strip zeroing.
