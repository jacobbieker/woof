"""The surface-radiation carrier contract: who wrote it, and how long ago.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS.  A land-surface scheme reads its downward
radiation out of a plain device buffer.  A buffer holds a number whether
or not anything ever computed one, so every defect in this family has the
same shape: the LSM integrates a value that no producer wrote, the number
is physically plausible, and nothing in the run says otherwise.  The
1.6.2 nocturnal-dewpoint collapse was exactly that -- a silent fixed
300 W m-2 GLW under a shortwave-only radiation pair -- and the fixes that
followed it were per-route: one refusal for one selector pairing, one
acknowledgement for one config table.  A per-route fix closes the route
it was written for and leaves the class open, which is why the audit kept
finding more of them (RUC's GSW frozen at zero, Noah's SWDOWN under
radiation-off, Noah-MP's COSZEN initialized once and then never again).

THE STRUCTURAL CLOSE is to stop treating a carrier as a number.  Every
radiative field a land-surface consumer reads carries three things:

* its VALUE, which lives where it always lived, in the device buffer;
* its SOURCE, one of :data:`CARRIER_SOURCES`, which says what kind of
  thing produced the number; and
* its ``last_update_model_time``, the model second at which a producer
  last wrote it, or ``None`` for a source that is constant by
  declaration.

and the check happens AT CONSUMPTION -- immediately before the LSM call,
in :meth:`woof.core.physics.PhysicsDriver.compute` -- rather than at
config load.  Consumption time is the only place that is downstream of
every way a driver can be built: the config door, a direct
``initialize_physics`` call, a restart, a DA analysis that rebuilt the
state between cycles.  The config-load guards
(``woof.physics_compat.radiation_off_land_surface_refusal`` and
friends) stay where they are and keep their voice, because a refusal at
the door is friendlier than a refusal three minutes into a run; they are
the early word, not the authority.

WHAT THE CHECK REFUSES, in the order it asks:

1. A carrier the consumer requires whose source is ``unwritten``.  This
   is the whole defect class in one line: the buffer holds its allocation
   fill and no producer has ever touched it.
2. A carrier whose value is not finite.
3. A scheme-produced carrier older than the radiation cadence plus one
   timestep of tolerance.  A producer that stopped producing is not
   distinguishable from one that never started, once the number is stale
   enough.

CONSUMER-CELL AWARENESS.  The refusal protects CONSUMPTION, and every
LSM in the matrix consumes by column: Noah, RUC and Noah-MP all skip
open-water columns (``xland >= 1.5`` with no sea ice), so a domain that
is entirely open water feeds its land-surface scheme exactly zero cells
and there is nothing for an unsourced carrier to corrupt.  The check
therefore counts the consumer's cells first -- with the SAME predicate
the runners dispatch on, over-approximated on ice (any ``xice > 0``
counts as a consumer, though the schemes threshold at 0.5) so the
footprint can only be over-stated, never under -- and returns without
refusing when that count is zero.  This is not a relaxation of
fail-closed: the moment one land or ice cell exists the refusal fires
exactly as before, and when the footprint CANNOT be established (no
``xland`` field to read) the check runs as if every cell consumed,
which is the fail-closed default.  An all-water idealised column with
radiation off and an LSM selected is a legitimate configuration -- the
marine surface path never opens a land energy budget -- and refusing it
would teach users that the contract cries wolf.

NOTE WHAT IS NOT ASKED: whether the number looks right.  Zero shortwave
at local midnight passes this check because its SOURCE is a shortwave
scheme and its AGE is within cadence, not because zero is plausible at
night.  Zero shortwave at local noon with no live producer fails, for the
same reason and by the same rule.  A contract that reasoned about
plausibility would have to know the solar geometry of every column, and
would still admit the exact defect it was written for -- 300 W m-2 is
plausible everywhere.

THE ESCAPE, :data:`SURFACE_RADIATION_POLICY_WRF_COMPAT_ZERO`, reproduces
the pre-contract behaviour: carriers with no producer are labelled
``wrf_compat_zero`` and consumed.  It is never selected automatically, it
binds into experiment and restart identity, it labels every carrier it
touches, and it appears in the run receipt and the output metadata.  It
is an experimental forcing, not a valid configuration for a real case: a
surface energy budget closing against a longwave nobody computed is not a
forecast of anything.  The same sentence applies to a DECLARED CONSTANT
longwave, which the contract admits with a source of its own --
``declared_constant`` is a statement that the caller typed a number, not
a statement that radiation is available.
