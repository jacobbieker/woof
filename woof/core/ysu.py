"""YSU planetary-boundary-layer column kernel.

This module is the device launcher for the WRF v4.6.1 YSU transcription in
``kernels/ysu.cu``.  The scheme consumes mass-point wind, potential
temperature, moisture, pressure/Exner, layer depths, and the surface-layer
coupling fields (UST, HFX/QFX, PSIM/PSIH).  It returns tendencies rather than
updating the state; Phase 3 Task 12's physics driver owns their application.

Array layout is woof's standard ``(nz, ny, nx)`` with x fastest.  Every CUDA
thread owns one complete column and performs the implicit vertical solves
in-thread, matching the acoustic Thomas-solve pattern.  The float64 authority
is :func:`woof.verify.npref.np_ysu_column`.
