"""Write the vortex track out: one CSV per run.

:mod:`woof.core.storm_tracking` already knows where the storm is -- it
has to, to steer the nest -- but that answer only ever reached the
relocation receipts, as parent grid cells, at the relocation cadence.
This turns the SAME fix into a file a human can plot and a script can
parse, without a second centre-finder that could drift from the first.

ONE SOURCE OF TRUTH.  Every row comes from
:meth:`woof.core.storm_tracking.StormTracker.locate`, which is the
first half of ``desired_shift`` with the hysteresis removed.  A run's
track and its nest therefore cannot disagree about where the vortex was:
they are the same computation.  ``locate`` is stateless and silent (no
receipt, no cooldown, no proposal), which is what lets this file be
written oftener than the nest moves -- proven byte-for-byte in
``tests/test_storm_tracking_locate.py`` and end to end against a control
forecast in ``MOVING-NESTS-FINALIZE.md``.

THE FORMAT IS CSV: the column names on line one and nothing above them,
then one row per fix.  ``pandas.read_csv(path)`` and
``csv.DictReader(open(path))`` therefore both work with no arguments --
no ``comment=``, no ``skiprows=``, no width table.  Decimal degrees,
millibars, metres per second, and the valid time spelled the way wrfout
spells it, so a row joins onto a history frame by string equality.
Anything richer -- a deck format, a database -- is post-processing, and
post-processing is better done by the tool that needs it than guessed at
here.

TWO SHAPES, DECIDED BY THE TRACKER'S FIELD, and the header says which
one a reader is holding:

* ``field = "pressure"`` -- a vortex deck.  Where the storm is, how deep
  it is and how hard it is blowing (``valid_time``, ``lat_deg``,
  ``lon_deg``, ``mslp_mb``, ``vmax_m_s``), plus a ``(lat, lon, height)``
  triple per tracked isobaric surface.

* ``field = "uh"`` / ``"reflectivity"`` -- POSITION ONLY: ``valid_time``,
  ``lat_deg``, ``lon_deg``, and those are the MOVING DOMAIN'S OWN CENTRE
  rather than the signal's.  A rotation or echo tracker follows
  convection, which has no central pressure and no storm-scale peak
  wind, and the useful thing to plot for it is the footprint that
  actually integrated.  See POSITION_ONLY_FIELDS.

NO FIELD EVER NEEDS QUOTING.  Every column is a number or the timestamp
``2025-10-24_12:00:00``; no comma, no quote and no newline can appear in
any column of any row.  So the file is valid RFC 4180 *and*
``line.split(",")`` is a correct parser for it -- the property a one-line
awk or shell reader depends on, and the reason nothing here imports
:mod:`csv` to write it.

TAIL-SAFE WHILE IT IS BEING WRITTEN.  The file is LINE BUFFERED and
flushed after every row, so a reader that opens it mid-run -- ``tail
-f``, a live plot, a UI drawing the track as the storm moves -- always
sees complete rows: every consultation that has happened is on disk,
and no half-written row is ever visible, because a row reaches the
operating system the instant its newline is written.  That is what lets
``csv.DictReader`` on a second handle be correct AT ANY MOMENT rather
than only once the run has closed the file.  The buffering is the
guarantee and the explicit flush is the statement of it: neither is
allowed to be the only one, because a write path added later that
forgets to flush would otherwise hold rows back to an 8 KiB boundary --
roughly 150 rows, hours of a storm -- and the live tail would stall
without anything looking broken.

WHAT IS NOT PROMISED IS ``fsync``.  Rows are handed to the OS, never
forced onto the platter.  A KILLED PROCESS therefore loses nothing --
the kernel already holds every row -- while a POWER CUT may lose the
last rows the disk had not yet written.  That is the right trade for a
diagnostic that runs beside a forecast: an fsync per row would put a
device flush on the model's own thread at the relocation cadence, to
protect a file whose next row is due in minutes and whose contents are
recomputable from the run.  Durability across a power loss is the
restart file's job, and the forecast already pays for that one.

THE PROVENANCE BANNER IS GONE, deliberately.  A ``# woof storm track``
line above the names is exactly what forces every reader to pass
``comment="#"``, and the run's receipt already carries the path, the
record count and the contract version.  The column names are
identification enough.

WHAT IT IS NOT.  It is not the GFDL vortex tracker and does not
reproduce its centre-finding; it is WOOF's own tracker, reported.  WRF
writes no track file at all -- its moving nest prints a centre to
``rsl.out``, and the decks in that ecosystem come from the GFDL tracker
as post-processing -- so there is no Fortran oracle behind this output
and it must not borrow credibility from the bitwise claims elsewhere in
this tree.  Its evidence is structural: the columns and units are what
the header says, the clock is the valid time, and a row is either accurate
or explicitly absent.

CONFIG.  ``[relocation.track]`` under ``[relocation]``: ``path``, and
optional ``interval_seconds`` and ``output_level``.  Absent, no file is
written and the run behaves exactly as it did before this module
existed.

``output_level`` names the BLOCKS the file carries -- ``SURFACE_LEVEL``
(0) for the centre with its central pressure and peak wind, and any
isobaric surface in hPa for a ``(lat, lon, height)`` triple -- and the
ORDER it carries them in.  It is INDEPENDENT of
``[relocation.follow]``'s ``level_hpa``: what steers a nest and what a
deck reports are different questions, so a run tracking 850/700/500 may
report the vortex every 50 hPa without adding a single surface to the
steering vote.

A surface named here that ``level_hpa`` does not track becomes a
REPORT-ONLY surface on the follow config
(:attr:`woof.core.storm_tracking.FollowConfig.report_level_hpa`,
derived in :mod:`woof.experiment`, the one place that sees both
blocks).  The TRACKER then computes it -- same plane, same centre
search, its own ``LevelFix`` -- and leaves it out of the steering mean,
so this writer still reads every column off one fix and never runs a
second search of its own.

Absent, the file carries the surface block plus every TRACKED surface in
the tracker's own order, which is what this module has always written.
The tracked ``field`` still decides the column SHAPE: a rotation or echo
tracker is position-only (``POSITION_ONLY_FIELDS``) and refuses
``output_level`` at admission, because there is nothing to choose
between.

NEVER FAILS A FORECAST.  Everything checkable is checked at config load
(:func:`woof.experiment._build_relocation`), before a single step runs.
Anything that still goes wrong per-record is caught, counted, and
reported on the run's receipt -- the same posture the tracker takes
toward a signal it cannot find.  A diagnostic that can kill a 12-hour
forecast is a defect.

    (lat, lon, height) triple per tracked isobaric surface.

    THE TIME COLUMN IS THE VALID TIME, spelled exactly as wrfout spells
    it (``2025-10-24_12:36:00``), so a row joins onto a history frame by
    string equality and a reader never has to know the run's initial time
    to place it.  Model seconds were the first design and were wrong for
    the file's actual audience: a person plotting a storm wants a clock,
    and the elapsed time is recoverable from any two rows anyway.

    DECIMAL DEGREES, signed -- no hemisphere letters.  This file exists
    to be read and plotted, and a plotter that has to un-encode a
    hemisphere is a plotter nobody writes.

    ``levels`` is ``[(lat, lon, height_dam), ...]`` in the order the
    config named the surfaces.  HEIGHT IS IN DECAMETRES, which is the
    unit every upper-air chart uses -- 850 hPa reads 143 dam in the deep
    tropics, not 1434 m -- so a number in this file compares directly
    against the analysis a forecaster is already looking at.

    A surface that produced no centre this consultation contributes
    ``NaN`` in all three of its columns and does NOT shift the ones
    after it: the column count is fixed by the config, not by what the
    atmosphere happened to offer.

    ``None`` in any data column writes ``NaN``.  A consultation that
    found nothing is therefore a row of all-NaN data with its clock
    intact: the time axis stays complete, so a gap is VISIBLE in the
    file rather than inferred from a jump in the clock, and no separate
    marker column is needed to say so.

    NOT PADDED.  The old format was fixed-width as well as
    whitespace-separated, and padding a CSV field is legal but hostile:
    it forces ``skipinitialspace`` on readers that do not strip, and it
    puts trailing blanks inside the one column that is a string.  The
    commas carry the structure now.

    PRECISION IS FIXED PER COLUMN rather than left to ``repr``: four
    decimal places of latitude is 11 m, finer than any grid this tracker
    runs on, and a column that prints 15.7072 on one row and
    15.707199999999998 on the next diffs badly and plots identically.

    WHICH GRID a row came from is deliberately NOT here.  It is on the
    relocation receipt for every consultation, where the rest of the
    provenance already lives, and a column that is the same string on
    almost every row of a plotting file earns nothing.
