"""Microphysics: scheme registry and the Kessler warm-rain launcher.

:func:`apply` is the single public surface, called by ``dycore.step`` after
the RK3 loop (WRF solve_em: the non-timesplit microphysics runs once per
model step on the updated fields) and dispatching on ``cfg.mp_physics``:
0 is a no-op (the state is untouched -- the whole dry/moist-without-mp
suite is bitwise unaffected), 1 is Kessler
(kernels/kessler.cu, transcribed from the bundle's WRF v4.6.1
``phys/module_mp_kessler.F``; float64 mirror
``woof.verify.npref.np_kessler_column``), 6 is WSM6, 8 is the classic
Thompson CUDA path (packaged byte-validated WRF v4.6.1 tables, env-var
table-root override honored), 10 is Morrison two-moment
(``woof.core.morrison`` / ``kernels/morrison.cu``), 18 is NSSL
two-moment through its persistent production binding, and 28 is
aerosol-aware Thompson (``woof.core.microphysics_aerosol`` and the eight
``kernels/thompson_aerosol_*.cu`` translation units; WRF
Registry/Registry.EM_COMMON:3036).  mp=28 is a SIBLING of the mp=8 path,
never a branch inside it: ``kernels/thompson.cu`` and
``woof.core.thompson`` are byte-frozen and gain nothing from this port,
which is what makes the mp=8 non-regression a statement about bytes.

The scheme inputs follow WRF ``moist_physics_prep_em``
(dyn_em/module_big_step_utilities_em.F) with ``use_theta_m = 0`` (woof's
dry-theta prognostic): full potential temperature ``thb + thp``, DRY
density ``rho = 1/alt``, full-pressure Exner ``pii = (p/p0)^(Rd/cp)``, and
half-level heights / layer depths from the full geopotential -- so
``apply`` must run with up-to-date EOS diagnostics (``dycore.step`` calls
it right after its epilogue ``update_diagnostics``).  The scheme updates
theta (latent heating) and the active water mass/number moments in place;
surface precipitation accumulates in persistent ``mp_*`` scratch slots
(mm, matching WRF's RAINNC/SNOWNC/GRAUPELNC and per-call ``*NCV`` fields).

h_diabatic (audit finding R7): each scheme adapter brackets its column
kernel with WRF's prep/finish pair.  :func:`save_pre_mp_theta` parks the
pre-microphysics full theta in ``state.h_diabatic`` (moist_physics_prep_em,
module_big_step_utilities_em.F:5503/:5523-5526) and
:func:`moist_physics_finish` applies the clamped theta increment ONCE to
the prognostic theta and stores the heating rate ``mpten/dt`` back in
``state.h_diabatic`` (moist_physics_finish_em, :5682-5746) for the NEXT
step's RK tendencies (dycore.add_h_diabatic_tendency).  Float64 mirror:
``woof.verify.npref.np_moist_physics_finish``.

Specified-zone ring exclusion (Wave-1 rank-1 seam fix): on every
specified or nested WRF domain the microphysics tiles are clipped by
``sz = spec_zone`` (solve_em.F:3618-3622; ``specified .or. nested`` per
:3692) -- moist_physics_prep (:3631-3639), the scheme driver
(module_microphysics_driver.F:802-806/:870-879), and
moist_physics_finish including the h_diabatic capture (:4040-4048) all
run ``its = max(i_start, ids+sz) .. ite = min(i_end, ide-1-sz)``,
``jts = max(j_start, jds+sz) .. jte = min(j_end, jde-1-sz)``, so the
outermost ``sz`` mass ring is NEVER touched: ring RAINNC is exactly 0.0
at every lead, ring theta/moisture keep their boundary-installed values,
and ring h_diabatic stays 0 (allocator zero init,
frame/module_domain.F:770-777 / tools/gen_allocs.c:411-415;
set_physical_bc3d writes halo indices only, module_bc.F:867-885).
Scope qualifications (explicit non-goals): WRF's optional
``mp_zero_out`` path zeroes moisture over WHOLE-field mass bounds before
the clipped finish (solve_em.F:4002-4038) -- woof has no mp_zero_out,
so the never-touched statement holds for every supported configuration;
and a specified+periodic_x channel clips j only
(module_microphysics_driver.F:871-873) -- woof has no channel mode and
always excludes the four-sided ring.  An earlier
in-tree justification argued the whole-field call was inert because the
spec-zone theta TENDENCY is replaced and spec-zone theta values are
overwritten each stage; that argument was overbroad -- the schemes'
direct in-place ring theta/moisture updates and the finish's direct
``thp += mpten`` land AFTER dycore.step's end-of-step
``apply_state_boundary_values``, and ring RAINNC accumulated where WRF's
is exactly zero, leaking into interior rows through the next step's
stencils (measured: O(0.1 mm/h) ring RAINNC and a sustained rows-1..4
theta/qv envelope).  :func:`apply` therefore excludes the ring for
specified/nested configs: every scheme here is a per-column kernel with
no horizontal coupling inside the call, so capturing the ring before
dispatch and bit-restoring it afterwards is bitwise identical -- ring
AND interior -- to WRF's clipped tiles (see
:func:`spec_zone_ring_slices`).  Periodic/open configs keep the exact
whole-field behavior (WRF: sz = 0), so every frozen idealized case is
bitwise unchanged.

    Checkpoints written before the ring exclusion landed carry the SAME
    restart format version, and whole-field microphysics could leave them
    with nonzero ring RAINNC/*NCV/SR/refl and a stale ring h_diabatic.
    No WRF-valid trajectory can contain such values: the fields are
    allocator-zero-initialized (frame/module_domain.F:770-777,
    tools/gen_allocs.c:411-415) and every MP tile write is clipped
    (solve_em.F:3631-3639/:4040-4048).  Without this step the guard's
    capture/restore would preserve the stale ring FOREVER, and ring
    h_diabatic would feed every RK stage (dycore.add_h_diabatic_tendency)
    before post-RK microphysics re-pins it.  Ring prognostics (theta,
    moisture) are deliberately NOT touched -- the boundary machinery owns
    and overwrites them every step.  Value-level and idempotent (post-fix
    checkpoints already carry zero rings), so the restart format version
    is unchanged: this function IS the documented migration step for
    pre-fix checkpoints.  Periodic/open domains are untouched.

    ``relocated`` NAMES THE ONE TRAJECTORY THAT BREAKS THE IDEMPOTENCE
    CLAIM ABOVE, and it is not a pre-fix file.  A relocation shifts the
    carried accumulators in INDEX space
    (:func:`woof.core.physics_continuation.shift_continuation`), so a
    column that spent the run accumulating as interior ``i = 1`` becomes
    ring ``i = 0`` the moment the nest steps one cell east -- still the
    same ground, still that ground's real rain total, and still able to
    return to the interior on the next westward step.  A post-fix
    checkpoint of a MOVING nest therefore carries a nonzero ring
    legitimately, this normalization is not idempotent on it, and firing
    it destroys accumulated precipitation that no later step recomputes
    (MEASURED: a 1 km nest 6 h into a 24 h run resumed with its whole
    west column of RAINNC zeroed, up to 3.77 mm, frozen for the rest of
    the forecast).  WRF's own moving nest shifts RAINNC wholesale for the
    same reason.

    The exemption is exactly the RELOCATION-CARRIED set, read from the
    registry that decides what a move shifts rather than restated here,
    so the two cannot drift.  ``refl_10cm`` and ring h_diabatic are NOT
    in it and are normalized either way: nothing shifts them, the ring
    guard re-pins h_diabatic on every microphysics call, and WRF's ring
    value for both is an unconditional zero.

    """WRF ``microphysics_init``'s ONE-TIME, per-domain scheme setup.

    The analogue of ``phys/module_physics_init.F::microphysics_init``, which
    WRF calls once per domain at construction and never again.  It is
    separate from :func:`apply` for the reason WRF keeps it separate: what
    it does is not a tendency, and doing it twice is not idempotent in
    general.  Returns a RECEIPT -- a mapping naming what actually ran --
    rather than ``None``, so a caller can print it and a test can assert on
    it.  ``{}`` means "this scheme needs no domain-construction step", which
    is true of every scheme woof shipped before mp=28.

    ``mp_physics = 28`` is the first scheme with real work here.  WRF's
    ``thompson_init`` fills a SYNTHETIC CCN/IN profile whenever the
    water/ice-friendly aerosol fields arrive unset
    (module_mp_thompson.F:482-559; the CCN decision at :493 and the IN
    decision at :530 are two independent ``MAXVAL`` tests), and derives the
    surface emission ``nwfa2d`` from it at :509-510.  Nothing inside
    ``mp_gt_driver`` ever refills that profile.  Without this call an mp=28
    domain integrates with ``nwfa``/``nifa`` at whatever the state
    allocation left -- exactly zero on a cold start -- which is not an
    error anywhere: the terminal apply's clamps
    (:3972-4021) simply hold the aerosol at its floors, the run stays
    finite, and the aerosol-aware physics is silently inert.  That is the
    single most dangerous failure mode this scheme has, which is why the
    hook is a named, receipt-returning function rather than a line inside
    an adapter.

    THE CALLER.  Domain construction, once, before the first step, beside
    the other one-time physics initializations --
    ``woof/core/physics.py::initialize_physics``, which is woof's
    ``module_physics_init.F`` and which every mp-bearing configuration
    already reaches (``physics_driver_required`` is true whenever
    ``cfg.mp_physics`` is nonzero, physics.py:241-250).  WP-11a does not own
    that file; until the call lands there, an mp=28 forecast started from a
    zero-aerosol state runs the inert-aerosol configuration described above.
    Calling this per step would be worse than not calling it: it would
    overwrite an advected, activated and scavenged aerosol field with the
    synthetic profile every step while leaving every bound intact.
