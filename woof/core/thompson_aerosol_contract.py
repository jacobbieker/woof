"""WRF v4.6.1 aerosol-aware Thompson ``mp_physics=28`` table contract.

This module is intentionally CPU-only and self-contained.  It is the aerosol
sibling of :mod:`woof.core.thompson_contract`, which stays byte-frozen: the
four classic ``mp_physics=8`` assets, their SHA-256 pins, and
``TABLE_SET_ID`` are imported read-only and never widened here.  The
numerical authority is NCAR WRF v4.6.1 commit
``d66e442fccc04111067e29274c9f9eaccc3cef28``, specifically
``phys/module_mp_thompson.F``.

mp=28 needs three distinct kinds of coefficient, and conflating them is the
first way a port goes wrong.  Each is handled differently on purpose:

``tnccn_act`` -- a **pinned external asset woof redistributes verbatim**.
    ``table_ccnAct`` (module_mp_thompson.F:5110-5166) does not compute
    anything.  It ``OPEN``s ``CCN_ACTIVATE.BIN`` by bare relative name and
    performs one sequential ``READ`` into ``REAL(4)
    tnccn_act(7,9,7,5,4)``.  The file is the tabulated output of an offline
    parcel model (Feingold & Heymsfield, modified by Eidhammer and
    Kreidenweis; see the comment at 5102-5108) shipped in WRF's ``run/``
    directory.  No recompilation of WRF regenerates it.

    It is therefore *data*, not a ``thompson_init`` product, and woof ships
    it the way WRF does: the committed copy is WRF v4.6.1's
    ``run/CCN_ACTIVATE.BIN`` bit for bit, redistributed under WRF's
    public-domain dedication with the notice carried by
    ``woof/data/wrf_radiation/LICENSE-WRF.txt``.  It is committed and
    listed in ``tables/MANIFEST.sha256``, but it is deliberately **not**
    part of ``thompson_contract.CLASSIC_TABLE_ASSETS`` and
    ``TABLE_SET_ID`` is unchanged, so no ``mp_physics=8`` launch acquires a
    dependency on it.  It is content addressed here -- the size and SHA-256
    of the WRF v4.6.1 file are pinned -- and it is located through
    :func:`resolve_ccn_activation_path`, which accepts an explicit path, an
    environment override, or the packaged table root, and **fails closed**
    when the file is absent or is a different table.  Shipping it does not
    soften any of that: a *different* parcel-model table would silently be a
    different activation scheme, and there is no synthetic fallback, because
    ``table_ccnAct`` prefills ``tnccn_act`` with 1.0 -- a scheme that quietly
    continued without the file would activate every available CCN at every
    gridpoint and still run, stay bounded, and be silently wrong.  See
    ``woof/data/thompson/PROVENANCE.md``.

``tpc_wev`` / ``tnc_wev`` -- **already covered by the classic asset**.
    ``table_dropEvap`` (5011-5099) is called unconditionally at
    ``thompson_init`` line 1025, outside the ``is_aerosol_aware`` guard, and
    in v4.6.1 its droplet-number axis already sweeps
    ``nu_c = MIN(15, NINT(1000e6/t_Nc(k)) + 2)`` from 15 down to 2.  The
    tables woof already pins as records 6 and 7 of
    ``thompson_aux_tables.dat`` are therefore the full aerosol-aware tables;
    mp=28 needs no new file and no re-pin, it merely starts *reading*
    ``tnc_wev``, which has been uploaded-but-unread since the mp=8 port.
    :func:`build_drop_evaporation_tables` reimplements the generator purely
    so :func:`validate_drop_evaporation_tables` can prove that claim against
    the packaged bytes rather than asserting it.

Gamma moments and the droplet-number bin grid -- **derived at import**.
    ``ccg``/``ocg1``/``ocg2`` (671-685) and the ``t_Nc`` bin edges
    (720-731) are fifteen- and hundred-element arrays, far too small to
    justify a file.  They are recomputed here from a transcription of WRF's
    ``REAL(4)`` ``WGAMMA``/``GAMMLN`` (5325-5377) -- *not* from
    :func:`math.gamma`, which disagrees in the seventh digit -- and the
    result is SHA-256 pinned so a gamma-implementation drift is caught as
    loudly as a substituted binary would be.

    Every transcendental on that derivation path goes through
    :mod:`woof.core.correctly_rounded_libm` rather than :mod:`math`.  The
    host C library is not the same program on every box -- the UCRT and glibc
    disagree by one ulp on ``EXP(0.61*LOG(3000))``, which is one of the
    hundred ``t_Nc`` bin edges -- and a pin that moves with the vendor of
    libm is a pin that fires on the wrong thing.  The pinned bytes are a
    property of the algorithm, not of the machine that ran it.

``mp_physics=28`` is not made selectable by importing this module.
