"""How far a moving nest can get from where it starts: its REACH.

A moving nest moves in whole cells of its parent, at cadence
opportunities, by a bounded shift per move.  Its settings therefore bound
how far it can get from its declared placement by the end of the run, and
so do the rows of an explicit ``[[relocation.move]]`` itinerary when those
drive it.  The reach is that bound: per grid axis, in whole cells of the
mover's parent, the lowest and highest displacement the run can produce.

WHAT IT SIZES.  The statics corridor (:mod:`woof.static.corridor`) holds
child-resolution statics for every footprint a relocation can crop.  Sized
to the whole parent it made a storm-following 500 m tier need a 64 to
128 GiB host: a 6 h run over a 2,700 x 3,000 km parent sealed a 25 GB
corridor for the 500 m nest and peaked at 62 GB while preparing.  Sized to
the reach it covers the ground the nest can get to and nothing else.

WHY A SPEED BOUND.  A tracker's settings bound its reach, but loosely: a
nest allowed 8 parent cells every 30 minutes can cross 17,000 km of a
9 km parent in five days, so over a long run the settings alone reach the
whole parent.  ``reach_speed_m_s`` is the named bound for that case: at
model time ``t`` the nest may be at most ``reach_speed_m_s * t`` plus one
move from its declared placement along each grid axis.  The runner
enforces it the way it enforces ``max_move_parent_cells``: a move that
would pass it is clamped, and the receipt names ``reach_speed_m_s`` in
``clamped_by``.  Because it grows with ``t`` rather than being fixed by
the run length, a run extended on restart moves exactly as the longer run
would have.

THE DEFAULT, :data:`DEFAULT_REACH_SPEED_M_S`, is 40 m/s: WRF's own default
for the same quantity (``max_vortex_speed``, the fastest vortex its
vortex-following nest searches for), and above the forward speed of any
tropical cyclone or supercell on record (about 30 m/s at the extreme).
It is the smallest bound that clamps no real storm; a configuration that
follows something faster names a larger value.

Nothing here reads a field or a GPU array: it is arithmetic on the
validated experiment, shared by the corridor emission, the run-plan
estimate, the terrain survey, the corridor loader and the runner's clamp,
so all five agree on one number.
