Configuration predicates and name tables only, split out of

(:func:`woof.core.preflight.physics_array_shapes`) is the consumer that

on a card -- reached ``import cupy`` through this metadata and refused
every CPU-only install, with ``--card`` declared and the answer already
in hand (measured by the 2.5.0 persona walks).

Everything here is re-exported by :mod:`woof.core.physics`, whose
docstrings carry the WRF line-number authority; import from either, but
from HERE when the caller must stay importable without cupy.  The
