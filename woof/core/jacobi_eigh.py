"""Batched symmetric eigendecomposition on the device, without cuSOLVER.

One thread block per matrix, two-sided cyclic Jacobi in shared memory.  The
algorithm, the ordering, the padding of odd sizes and the canonical output
form are all documented in ``woof/core/kernels/jacobi_eigh.cu``; this module
is the launcher and the refusal surface.

Why this exists
---------------
``woof.da.letkf`` factors one small symmetric matrix per analysis gridpoint
-- k x k with k the ensemble size, a few hundred thousand of them per cycle.
Until this module, that single call was the ONLY thing in woof that needed a
linear-algebra library: the dycore, the physics and the microphysics are
hand-written CUDA and elementwise CuPy throughout, and the one ``eigh`` pulled
in cuSOLVER (and, through it, cuBLAS and cuSPARSE) for the whole DA path.
That dependency cost real time twice -- once where the NVIDIA wheels were
installed but invisible to a compiled extension under Python's post-3.8 DLL
resolution, and once on a rented node whose CUDA install simply shipped
without it.  Both faults present as the same masquerade: elementwise CuPy
works, so the GPU is obviously fine, and only the factorisation fails.

A batch of k <= 64 matrices is also the case a general-purpose library is
worst at and a purpose-built kernel is best at, so removing the dependency and
going faster are the same piece of work rather than a trade.

Supported range
---------------
``MIN_K <= k <= MAX_K``, float32 or float64, on CuPy.  Outside that range this
module REFUSES rather than degrading: :func:`supported` answers the question
without raising and :func:`batched_eigh` raises :class:`JacobiEighError`.  A
caller that wants a library fallback should ask :func:`supported` first --
``woof.da.letkf`` does exactly that.

The ceiling is shared memory, not the algorithm.  Each matrix holds two k x k
working arrays in shared, so a float64 problem needs about ``16 k^2`` bytes,
and at k = 64 that is 64 KiB -- one block per multiprocessor even with the
opt-in limit raised.  k = 64 therefore WORKS but is bandwidth-starved; see
the measurements in ``docs/da_jacobi_eigensolver.md``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a
        CuPy array ``(n, k, k)``.  Only the values actually present are read;
        the matrix is NOT symmetrised here, because the caller that needs a
        symmetric input is the caller that knows which triangle is

        Also return the largest sweep count any matrix in the batch needed.
        Free -- the launch already reports it per matrix, and the refusal
        check already reduces over that array -- and it is the only cheap
        early warning that a caller's matrices are worse conditioned than it
        believes.

    Returns
    -------
    ``(w, v)`` matching ``cupy.linalg.eigh``'s contract -- ``w`` ascending
    ``(n, k)``, ``v[i, :, j]`` the unit eigenvector for ``w[i, j]`` -- with
    the additional sign convention documented in the kernel: the
    largest-magnitude component of every eigenvector is positive, ties broken
    by the lowest row index.

    Raises
    ------
    JacobiEighError
        On an unsupported ``k`` or dtype, on a non-finite input, or on a
        matrix still rotating at the sweep cap.  Nothing is returned in those
