"""The FP32 primitives the vectorised Noah-MP composition is allowed to use.

Noah-MP's column composition -- ENERGY's own arithmetic and NOAHMP_SFLX's
prefix and postfix -- is transcribed in :mod:`woof.core.noahmp_energy` and
:mod:`woof.core.noahmp_sflx` as scalar CPython: Python floats with an explicit
``f32`` rounding call after every operation.  That transcription is what the
unmodified-WRF fixtures pin, and it is also, measured, essentially the entire
cost of a Noah-MP land-surface call.

Evaluating it for every land column at once needs the same arithmetic over
arrays.  This module states, in one place, which array operation reproduces
which scalar one **bitwise**, and refuses to guess:

``+ - * /`` and ``sqrt``
    IEEE-754 correctly rounded in binary32, so a CuPy float32 ufunc is
    bit-identical to ``f32(a op b)`` with no wrapper at all.  Each ufunc is
    its own launch, so nothing here can be contracted into an FMA either.
    ``test_ieee_agreement`` and ``test_sqrt_agreement`` are the gates that say
    so, over 40,006 argument pairs each.

``min`` / ``max``
    **Not** ``cupy.minimum``/``cupy.maximum``.  ENERGY spells them
    ``a if a < b else b`` (:func:`woof.core.noahmp_energy._mn`), which returns
    the *second* argument on a tie; ``cupy.minimum(-0.0, +0.0)`` returns
    ``-0.0`` where ``_mn(-0.0, +0.0)`` returns ``+0.0``.  gfortran does not
    flush, so signed zeros are exactly the input class this project has lost
    bugs to.  :func:`fmn` and :func:`fmx` are the ``where`` forms that match.

``powf`` / ``expf`` / ``logf`` / ``tanhf``
    Neither numpy's float32 versions nor CUDA's device libm are glibc's, and
    gfortran on x86-64 calls glibc's.  These go through
    ``woof/core/kernels/noahmp_libm_slab.cu``, which is a bare elementwise
    wrapper around the single audited device transcription already in this
    tree (``r_pow``/``r_exp``/``r_log`` in ``noahmp_leaves.cu`` and
    ``nmpe_tanhf`` in ``noahmp_energy.cu``).  No second copy is created here,
    which is also why the entry points are spelled ``slab_powf`` and not
    ``powf``: ``tests/test_noahmp_radiation.py`` treats a module under
    ``gpuwm/`` that *defines* ``powf`` as a fork of the transcription, and it
    is right to.

``tests/test_noahmp_slab_libm.py`` holds every claim above against
:mod:`woof.core.noahmp_libm`, with four negative controls: ``cupy.minimum``,
``numpy.power`` and ``cupy.exp`` are each shown failing a gate the wrapper
passes, and ``__double2float_rn`` is shown still flushing the subnormals that
``nmp_d2f_rn`` exists to recover.
