"""NOAHMP_SFLX's second half, evaluated for every land column at once.

``module_sf_noahmplsm.F:979-1076``.  :func:`woof.core.noahmp_sflx
.sflx_post_steps` holds the transcription the unmodified-WRF whole-column
fixture pins: one CPython frame per column, Python floats, an explicit ``f32``
rounding call after every operation, and ordinary ``if`` statements.  Measured
with ``cProfile``, that postfix is **13.7% of a Noah-MP land-surface call**, and
like ENERGY's composition it amortises over nothing -- there is no work in it
that two columns share.

This module is the same statements over the column axis.  It is not a second
port of the physics: the scalar module remains the authority and
``tests/test_noahmp_sflx_post_slab.py`` compares every field it owns against it,
bitwise.

Two segments, because WATER interrupts the postfix
==================================================

======== ==================================================================
seg1     :979-984.  SICE, SNEQVO and the QVAP/QDEW/EDIR block -- everything
         before the WATER call, plus the ENERGY exit column that WATER is
         handed.
seg2     :1014-1076.  The dead CARBON zeros, the dead irrigation identities,
         ERROR, the urban QSFC override, the snow clamp and the albedo
         sentinel.
======== ==================================================================

ERROR is not transcribed here
-----------------------------
``k_sflx_error`` in ``woof/core/kernels/noahmp_sflx.cu`` already **is** the
slab form of ERROR: it is one thread per column over ``[ncase][NSC]`` inputs,
it is held to ``noahmp-sflx-error.csv`` at ``max_ulp 0`` on all sixteen cases
by ``tests/test_noahmp_sflx_cuda.py``, and its argument shape is exactly the
one a slab has.  So :func:`sflx_post_seg2` launches it rather than writing a
fourth copy of ERROR's nine statements.

Its scalar packing is *read off the ``.cu``* -- the ``SC_``/``OU_`` blocks are
parsed by :func:`_slot_table` at call time -- rather than restated here.  A
34-slot layout that exists in three places (the kernel, its CUDA test and this
module) is a layout that will eventually disagree with itself, and the failure
mode of disagreeing is every column after the moved slot being read as the
wrong quantity.  Parsed, a slot added to the kernel without a value here is a
``KeyError`` that names it.

The one thing a kernel cannot do is abort.  ``k_sflx_error`` writes a status
word instead -- 1 shortwave, 2 energy, 3 water -- and this module raises the
same three exceptions :mod:`woof.core.noahmp_sflx` raises, naming the first
offending column, exactly as :mod:`woof.core.noahmp_energy_slab` does at the
emitted-longwave check.  A slab cannot raise for one column and continue for
the rest.

Where a branch became a mask, and where the denominator was substituted
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Every ``if`` on a per-column value is a :func:`cupy.where`.  Two of them guard
a division, and both substitute the denominator on the columns the mask
discards rather than relying on a NaN being thrown away:

* :1063's ``QFX / (RHOAIR * CH)`` runs only on urban columns.  The substitution
  is ``where(urban, rhoair * ch, 1.0)``, so an urban column keeps whatever the
  scalar path would have produced -- including a genuine division by zero, if
  one were ever reachable -- and a non-urban column stays finite.
* :1073's ``FSR / SWDOWN`` is guarded by ``SWDOWN /= 0`` at :1072, which is the
  night sentinel; the substituted denominator is ``1.0`` on exactly the columns
  the sentinel claims.

``min`` and ``max`` are :func:`woof.core.noahmp_slab_libm.fmn`/``fmx``, not
``cupy.minimum``/``maximum``: the scalar spelling returns the second argument on
a tie and the CuPy builtins do not.  That is not decorative here.  :983 is
``QDEW = ABS(MIN(RATIO, 0.0))`` and :982 is ``QVAP = MAX(RATIO, 0.0)``, so a
column whose FGEV is exactly zero lands on the tie in both, and ``ABS`` is a
sign-bit clear (:func:`woof.core.noahmp_slab_libm.slab_fabsf`), which is the
one operation that can still tell ``-0.0`` from ``+0.0`` after the clamp.

The layer accumulations
-----------------------
The postfix has exactly one, END_WB's ``SUM(SMC*DZSNSO)*1000`` at :1698-1700,
and it is inside ``k_sflx_error``, where it is already a layer loop with only
the column axis parallel.  FP32 addition is not associative, so that is the
only shape it can have.  SICE at :979 is elementwise across layers with no
accumulation, so the whole ``(n, NSOIL)`` slab is one expression.

The ENERGY exit column
----------------------
:func:`woof.core.noahmp_sflx.sflx_post_steps` opens by landing ENERGY's exit
arrays on the caller's ``SnowColumn`` (``col.stc[:] = en.stc`` and so on) before
handing that column to WATER.  That landing is the Python port's spelling of
WRF's own aliasing -- NOAHMP_SFLX passes one set of arrays to both ENERGY and
WATER -- and it is arithmetic-free, but it is also exactly where a slab can
transpose two same-shaped arrays and be wrong in a way no bitwise arithmetic
check can see.  :func:`sflx_post_seg1` therefore performs it and returns the
result, as copies, under the ``SnowColumn`` attribute names.
