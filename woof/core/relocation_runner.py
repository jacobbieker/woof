"""Cadence-driven execution of discrete nest relocations inside a run.

:mod:`woof.core.nest_relocation` is the mechanism -- it moves a live
child once, when told where.  :mod:`woof.core.storm_tracking` is the
policy -- it proposes where.  This module is the runner between them: at
every complete cycle boundary that lies on the configured cadence, ask
the follow source for a desired whole-parent-cell shift and execute it
through :func:`~woof.core.nest_relocation.relocate_child` with host
staging, admissibility bounds, and a receipt appended to the run's
relocation receipts.

WHERE IT FIRES.  ``execute_experiment`` calls
:meth:`RelocationRunner.on_period_begin` at PERIOD_BEGIN, the instant
every domain clock in the tree sits on the same complete d01 boundary.
Every such boundary is a parent-step boundary for every child, which is
the synchronization :func:`relocate_child` requires; the cadence is
therefore validated to be a whole number of periods and can never ask
for a mid-step move.  ``cadence_seconds`` absent means every boundary,
with the tracker's own dead-band/cooldown as the rate limit.

THE FOLLOW SOURCE is the storm tracker's published plan-provider seam
(:mod:`woof.core.storm_tracking`, adopted verbatim)::

    provider(parent_state, nest_footprint, t) -> (di, dj) | None

``parent_state`` is the PARENT domain's live state; ``nest_footprint``
is anything :class:`~woof.core.storm_tracking.NestFootprint` can
coerce (the runner passes the child's live DomainConfig); ``t`` is model
seconds.  The return is the desired shift in WHOLE PARENT CELLS (``di``
increments ``i_parent_start``, ``dj`` increments ``j_parent_start``) or
``None`` for hold.  :class:`woof.core.storm_tracking.StormTracker`
implements it; :class:`ManualMoveProvider` implements the SAME contract
from the config's ``[[relocation.move]]`` rows, so the manual mode is a
standing test of the exact interface a tracker must satisfy.

The provider proposes; the runner enforces.  An executed shift is the
proposal clamped to ``max_move_parent_cells`` and to the parent's
admissible placement band, and both the requested and the executed shift
land in the receipt -- a clamped decision is visible, never silent.
After an executed move the runner calls the provider's OPTIONAL
``notify_move_executed(t, executed_shift)`` hook (accepted-move
semantics for trackers whose cooldown should count acceptances rather
than proposals); a provider without the hook simply is not notified.

After every executed move the runner chains the record into the model's
live restart fingerprint
(:func:`~woof.core.nest_relocation.mark_fingerprint_across_move`), so
checkpoints written later refuse to resume into a FRESH build BY
CONSTRUCTION and the refusal names relocation.  That chaining is also
what makes the resume possible at all: a restore replays the same
digests in the same order onto its own fingerprint, so it reaches the
checkpoint's value exactly when it is the run that wrote it.  See
:data:`~woof.core.nest_relocation.RESTART_ACROSS_MOVE_POSTURE` for what
a moved checkpoint promises, which is no longer nothing.

    Implements the storm tracker's plan-provider contract

    tell it from a tracker.  Each row fires at its exact ``at_seconds``
    opportunity and exactly once; opportunities with no row are holds.
    The rows were validated at config admission (strictly increasing,
    on-boundary, inside the run), so a row left unconsumed at run end is
    a runner defect, and :meth:`unconsumed` lets the receipts say so.

    A RESUME STARTS PAST ROWS THAT ALREADY FIRED, and the queue is
    strictly ordered: the head is matched EXACTLY, so a row whose
    opportunity is behind the clock can never match again -- and while it
    sits at the head it blocks every later row with it.  MEASURED: a
    resume from 1800 s of a run whose itinerary moved at 1200 s and
    2400 s executed NEITHER move; the nest stayed at its 1200 s
    footprint, the two frames after the missed 2400 s move differed from
    the uninterrupted run, and the restore banner said the resume
    reproduces that run bit for bit.  Rows behind the clock are therefore
    retired at the first consultation and named in the summary receipt
    (:meth:`behind_the_clock`), so the row still AHEAD of the clock
    fires.  Retiring is the right reading, not a convenience: a row
