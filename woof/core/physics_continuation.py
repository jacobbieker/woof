"""Move driver-held physics continuation state across a nest relocation.

TWO INVENTORIES LIVE HERE, and they are separate because their fill
rules differ.  The per-column CONTINUATION slots below cold-start on
fresh ground.  The surface-radiation CARRIERS at the end of this module
cannot: a carrier is consumed on every surface step but produced only on
the radiation cadence, so fresh ground has to arrive already carrying a
flux, and it takes the same nearest-same-landmask-class donor fill the
land-surface continuation fields take.

WHY THIS EXISTS (user report, 2026-08-16, moving nests with Kain-
Fritsch: "really weird artifacts").  A discrete relocation carries the
restart layer's serialised STATE (:func:`woof.core.nest_relocation.
relocatable_attrs`) and -- through the route preparers -- the land-
surface continuation fields.  Everything else the physics driver holds
per column was re-initialised from cold on the WHOLE child at every
accepted move: the KF NCA hold timers, the held cumulus rates,
PRATEC/RAINCV, the RAINC/RAINNC precipitation accumulators, the W0AVG
running trigger history.  Measured consequence on a moving KF nest:
convection cut off domain-wide at each move (held heating zeroed
mid-NCA), every column became simultaneously re-eligible (NCA back to
-100), the trigger memory restarted from zero (one 1/TST sample instead
of a converged mean), and the accumulated-precipitation products reset
to zero mid-run.  None of it is KF-only: RAINNC and UP_HELI_MAX reset
the same way.

THE RULE, so the inventory cannot rot: the shift set is DERIVED from
the restart registry, never hand-listed here.  What makes a slot
restart-serialised (``woof.io.restart.SERIALIZED_SCRATCH_SLOTS``) is
exactly the property -- cross-step per-column memory that nothing
recomputes -- that makes it relocation-carried, and the cumulus
adapter's array inventory (``CUMULUS_CALLABLE_ARRAYS``) rides the same
contract. Raw PBL forcing uses DRIVER_HELD_FORCING_ATTRS from that same
registry: GF/New Tiedtke may consume it before the next PBL call after a
move. The overlap retains its rates and fresh ground starts at zero.
Positive-cadence PBL rates and radiation heating ride the same inventory.
After the transplant, PhysicsDriver.recouple_after_relocation applies the
ordinary mass coupling and face interpolation on the rebuilt grid to PBL,
radiation and cumulus rates. It runs no scheme and changes no cadence.

GEOMETRY.  The overlap shifts in index space with the same
:class:`~woof.core.nest_relocation.RelocationPlan` window the
serialised-state transplant uses.  The freshly exposed strip takes each
slot's documented COLD value -- new ground has no convection memory --
which is 0 for every slot except ``cu_nca``, whose cold value is the
-100 eligibility sentinel (woof/core/physics.py driver init;
module_cu_kfeta.F:3152-3156).

ACCUMULATED PRECIPITATION IS THE EXCEPTION (:data:`STRIP_ACCUMULATORS`).
Fresh ground has had rain since the run began; only the nest has not been
there to see it.  A strip started at zero drew a band of too little total
rain along every leading edge, one per move (a 12 h tropical storm run
moved its 3 km nest 8 times).  WRF interpolates RAINC, RAINNC, RAINSH,
SNOWNC, GRAUPELNC and HAILNC from the parent onto the exposed cells
(Registry.EM_COMMON flag ``d``; share/mediation_nest_move.F runs
med_interp_domain after shift_domain_em on the exposed mask), so a cell's
total is the parent's rain before the nest arrived plus the nest's after,
which is what a gauge there measures.  The route preparers pass those
parent values (:func:`parent_strip_accumulations`, WRF's SINT) as
``strip`` to :func:`shift_continuation`.  The same holds for the old
footprint's specified ring where it lands inside the new one: the nest's
microphysics never touches that ring (WRF's clipped tiles,
:func:`woof.core.physics_inventory.spec_zone_ring_slices`), so its rain total
is what the cell had when it arrived, and after a move it drew a one-cell
line of too little rain inside the nest, one per move (the ring column
held 24.3 mm beside 32 to 34 mm at 12 h).  It takes the parent's too.
A nest spawned mid-run starts from the parent's at birth by the same rule
(:func:`seed_birth_accumulations`); born at zero, the ground it held since
birth counted from a later start than the ground each move seeded, and
every move left a band of too much rain instead.

#   CarrierContractError: GLW (downward longwave at the surface, W m-2)
#   has no producer, and Noah (sf_surface_physics=2) is about to consume
#   it at model second 360.
#
# MEASURED, one forecast hour per arm on a real GFS case: relocation off
# with radt = 12 min passed; relocation on with radt = 12 min refused at
# the first move; relocation on with radt = 6 min -- aligned so a
# radiation call fell due on the very step the 360 s move landed on --
# passed with five executed moves.  Under the wizard's shipped defaults
# ANY relocation cadence shorter than the radiation interval refused at
# the first move.  The producer guard is correct; the transplant was
# short by exactly this inventory.
#
# THE RULE, so this inventory cannot rot either: the carried set is
# DERIVED from `radiation_carriers.CONSUMER_CARRIERS`, the same matrix
# the refusal reads to decide what a land-surface scheme eats.  A
# carrier added to that matrix tomorrow moves across relocations the day
# it is added.
#
# WHAT MOVES, in two halves that must both move or neither is worth
# anything.  The BUFFERS shift in index space through the same plan
# window as the serialised state, and the freshly exposed strip takes
# the nearest same-landmask-class donor inside the overlap -- the
# identical `DonorFillPlan` the land-surface continuation fields take,
# because a carrier is exactly that kind of field: consumed every
# surface step, produced only on the radiation cadence.  A zero strip
# would be a fabricated flux and a cold-start strip would be the
# allocation fill the contract exists to refuse.  The LEDGER moves
# VERBATIM -- source and last-write model time both -- because the
# second half of the same guard is a staleness test against
# (radiation cadence + one step), and re-stamping the move time would
# blind it: the transplanted flux really is as old as the outgoing
# child's, and saying so is what keeps "a producer that stopped"
# detectable across a move.
