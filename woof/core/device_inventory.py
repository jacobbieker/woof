"""The device inventories a CUDA preparation is priced from.

The exact ``DomainState`` allocation list, one boundary interval's side
tables and the card's CUDA context: the three things
:mod:`woof.ingest.preparation_price` needs to price a preparation before
its first device allocation.  They lived in :mod:`woof.core.preflight`,
the forecast memory preflight, which the standalone RW-WPS wheel does not
stage; a price that imported them from there raised ModuleNotFoundError in
that wheel and stopped every GFS, ERA5 and mapped preparation, and the
wheel builder refused the staging on the three unresolved imports.  Here
they sit in a leaf both packages carry, and preflight re-exports every
name, so the forecast preflight and the preparation price read one
inventory.

Module scope is stdlib plus :mod:`woof.config`; the one other internal
lookup, :mod:`woof.boundary_fields`, is function-local.  No CuPy.

#: What a CUDA context grows by once a forecast has loaded its kernel

#:
#: MEASURED 2026-08-20 (task 206), two Linux cards, driver 13030.  The
#: bare context is read by ``tools/vram_reserve_probe.py`` in a process
#: that creates a context and allocates one byte; the run-time figure is
#: ``device footprint peak - pool-held peak`` from fifteen whole
#: forecasts' own 20 Hz :class:`~woof.core.gpu_mem_watch.
#: GpuPeakMemoryWatcher` receipts, minus the reservation law's backing
#: store for the frame those runs launched:

#:   ==============  ==========  ============  ==========
#:   card            bare        at run time   growth
#:   ==============  ==========  ============  ==========
#:   RTX 5070 Ti      230.0 MiB   382.8 MiB     152.8 MiB
#:   RTX 5070 Ti      230.0 MiB   386.5 MiB     156.5 MiB
#:   RTX 5090         506.0 MiB   659.7 MiB     153.7 MiB
#:   RTX 5090         506.0 MiB   664.3 MiB     158.3 MiB
#:   ==============  ==========  ============  ==========
#:
#: The growth is a CONSTANT across a 2.4x span of card -- which is what
#: NVRTC module images and the driver's own working set should be, and
#: is not what a flat total context can be.  192 MiB rounds the worst
#: measurement up; an envelope must not round down.
#:
#: This is what RETIRES :data:`woof.core.preflight.CUDA_CONTEXT_BYTES`
#: as the charged term.  That constant is one 2026-07-26 reading of one
#: card, and applied everywhere it was wrong in BOTH directions at once:
#: 48 MiB high on a 5070 Ti and 215 MiB LOW on the very 5090 it was taken
#: from, once that card ran under Linux rather than WDDM.  A term that
#: under-charges is not conservative, it is an OOM waiting for a big
#: enough card.
CONTEXT_RUNTIME_GROWTH_BYTES = 192 * 1024 ** 2

#: Bare-context bytes per resident thread: what a card's CUDA context is
#: priced at from its shader census alone.
#:
#: Same campaign, the three cards' bare contexts over their
#: resident-thread capacities: 1,748 B (RTX 3080, WDDM, with a live
#: desktop sharing the card), 2,243 B (RTX 5070 Ti) and 2,032 B
#: (RTX 5090).  2,304 B is the figure rounded up above all three, so no
#: card is priced below any card that campaign measured.
#:
#: A MODELLED number, and it says so wherever it is printed
#: (:func:`non_pool_basis`).  It prices EVERY card this build reads, the
#: present one included, and that is deliberate.  A present card's bare
#: context used to be read off the card instead, as the NVML
#: ``memory.used`` delta either side of the probe's own context, and
#: that delta is a card-wide figure in whole MiB: on one idle RTX 4090
#: one probe printed 395 MiB (414,187,520 bytes) with every other field
#: of the probe identical across readings, and two earlier receipts of
#: the same plan sit exactly 3 and 4 MiB below it (bare contexts of 392
#: and 391 MiB by subtraction, never printed), so one plan was quoted
#: 1,162,304,164, 1,163,352,740 and 1,166,498,468 bytes by three
#: readings of one document.  An instrument that answers three
#: different numbers for one thing prices nothing; the census answers
#: one.  The run door's own machine (``tilestream.autoplan.Machine``)
#: has always priced the census, so this is also what makes the plan
#: review, ``woof check``, the wizard and the door agree on one card
#: to the byte.  A profile that arrives with a stated bare context (a
#: calibration receipt, a target-hardware sizing document) is priced
#: as stated; nothing in this build takes a fresh reading.
