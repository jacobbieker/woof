"""Itemize independent prepared radiation tile buffers without CUDA.

Both itemized radiation models reach this: RTE+RRTMGP through
:func:`standalone_rte_storage_bytes`, the legacy RRTMG port through its
own :func:`woof.core.rrtmg_legacy.legacy_radiation_vram_bytes`, selected
by ``physics_compat.rrtmg_variant`` in
:meth:`PreparedTileMemory.radiation_storage_bytes` and named in
:meth:`PreparedTileMemory.terms` under ``basis``.  The paragraphs below
describe the RTE+RRTMGP arm, which is the one the probes were taken on.

The prepared factory executes RRTMGPRadiation without chunk_workspace.
Its finalized optics and Planck arrays therefore cannot be priced from the
fused shared-workspace inventory.  Every buffer below pays its own complete
LW+SW allocation set: CuPy keeps separate free arenas for separate compute
streams.  This deliberately forgoes both phase aliasing and cross-buffer
pool reuse.  The column-bounded loader and its retained last slab are also
inside the envelope.  No physics implementation or user setting is changed.

THE MODEL PRICES THE ROUTE, NOT ONE CONFIGURATION.  Every term below is
read off the experiment it is handed -- ``nz``, ``p_top``, ``column_chunk``
from the vertical and chunking, the resident and transient bytes from
:func:`woof.core.preflight.estimate_domain` for whatever physics is
selected -- so it applies to any prepared single-root host-store run on the
RTE+RRTMGP solver.  It was first shipped behind a twelve-value config
fingerprint (Morrison, KF, YSU, nz 49, chunk 3125, ...), and every other
configuration on the same route silently kept the fused-inventory price,
measured 23 % low against this itemization at 980,000 cells with two
buffers (9.304 GiB itemized against 7.580 GiB fused, ENG-013).  The
fingerprint survives only as :func:`measured_anchor`, the configuration the
itemization was MEASURED against, for reports and tests -- never as a gate.

THE BUFFER IS PRICED AT THE WINDOW'S OWN SHAPE, NOT AT ``N x 1``.  Until
2.7.3 every buffer was itemized as an ``N x 1`` domain, ``N`` its column
count, on the argument that a one-row rectangle maximizes every horizontal
face and edge product and so bounds any rectangle of the same area.  It
does -- and for the terms that scale with the PERIMETER rather than the
area it bounds them by the perimeter of a rectangle no tiling can produce.
REPRODUCED on a user's 572x524x49 icon-eu forecast (Thompson, RTE+RRTMGP,
MYNN, Noah, six retained forcing intervals) with a pinned 250x250 tiling:
the 286x286 compute window is 81,796 columns, so the sizing rectangle was
81,796 x 1 with a perimeter 143x the window's, and its eager
``lbc_forcing_tables`` came to 9.03 GiB PER BUFFER against 0.06 GiB for the
window itself.  Two buffers of that, under the allocator headroom, put
20.8 GiB of forcing tables that no buffer allocates into the streamed
envelope, which read 38.96 GiB against a 17.43 GiB resident run -- a
streamed forecast priced at 2.2x the resident one, refused before fetch.

So a caller that knows the window (the pinned road, and the planner once
it has chosen a tile) passes ``shape=(window_nx, window_ny)`` and the
buffer is itemized at exactly that rectangle.  A caller that has only a
cell count (the planner's binary search over window sizes) gets
:meth:`PreparedTileMemory.sizing_shape`: the most elongated rectangle of
that area a tiling can LEGALLY produce -- no side narrower than the
smallest compute window, ``2 * halo + 1``, and none longer than the domain
plus its halo -- which still bounds every legal rectangle of that area on
every term, and does so by a perimeter a tiling can actually have.

MEASURED against the fix, 2026-09-10, a development machine (RTX 5070 Ti, 15.51 GiB,
cupy 14.2.0 / CUDA 13), the same 572x524x49 icon-eu forecast on real
2026-09-10T12 data, per-process device memory read by nvidia-smi
(``compute-apps used_memory``: the process's whole device allocation,
CUDA context included) at 0.2 s:

* 250x250 tiles, nbuffers = 1: this model 8.89 GiB; measured peak 6.18 GiB
  (6,326 MiB, at the radiation call), steady 5.97 GiB, over 40 steps and
  four radiation calls.
* 250x250 tiles, nbuffers = 2 (the user's tiling): this model 15.54 GiB;
  measured peak 11.11 GiB (11,374 MiB, recurring at each radiation call),
  steady 7.83 GiB between calls, over 122 steps, no allocation failure.

So the corrected envelope brackets the run on both roads with 28-31 %
to spare, and the per-buffer radiation storage it carries is a real
transient (about 1.6 GiB per buffer measured against the 2.01 GiB priced
per 3,125-column chunk here).  The run the user asked for does reach
11.1 GiB on a card of this class, above the 10.69 GiB they had free; one
buffer of the same tile measured 6.2 GiB and is the remedy.

    NOT A GATE ON ANYTHING UNMEASURED.  Four conditions this used to carry
    beyond the route -- ``cfg.specified``, a host store, CAM ozone, a
    follower window -- priced nothing and only sent the run back to the
    fused rung measured 23 % low, which is spent as window size and then

    instead: the ozone and follower carriers through ``estimate_domain``'s
    own keywords, the device carrier store through

    ONE LIMIT REMAINS, and it names what it cannot price: a DOMAIN TREE.
    Every term of the fixed floor below is the PREPARED STORE's -- the

    nest a prepared loader floor would be an invented basis rather than a
    conservative one; the measurements this module reports were all taken
    on a single prepared root.  It also moves shipped tree admission
    decisions (MEASURED: with the tree arm on, the two-domain case
    tests/test_auto_admission.py:129 pins moves its ROOT from resident to
    streamed), and a tree's per-domain planner search re-runs this
    itemization per candidate window, which took plan review from seconds
    to minutes on the 4-to-16 domain searches.  Retire by measuring a
    streamed nest's actual per-buffer floor and splitting the prepared
    loader terms out of :meth:`PreparedTileMemory.fixed_terms`; the
    per-domain plumbing is already here (:func:`domain_of`, the model's
