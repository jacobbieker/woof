"""One resolver for every packaged reference-data path under ``woof/data``.

Two directories of that tree do not ship inside the ``woof`` wheel any
more.  They ship in the ``recast-woof-data`` distribution, which ``woof``
declares as a hard dependency at its own exact version, and this module is
the only place that knows which is which.

Why
---
PyPI rejects any file over 100 MiB.  The 2.5.0 ``woof`` wheel measured
103.62 MiB (108,649,669 bytes) with the Rust bridge artifacts staged.  The
RRTMGP directory and the Thompson table directory were 64.21 MiB of that
compressed -- ``qr_acr_qsV2.dat`` at 29.79 MiB and
``rrtmgp-gas-lw-g256.nc`` at 19.69 MiB alone are half the wheel -- and
they are pure data: no code, no platform coupling, nothing a wheel tag
describes.  Moving them puts ``woof`` at 39.41 MiB and the companion at
64.31 MiB, both single ``py3-none-any``-eligible files well under the cap,
with room for the native artifacts still landing on the 2.5.0 line.

Nothing else about them changed.  The companion mirrors the old layout
exactly (``woof_data/data/rrtmgp/...`` for ``woof/data/rrtmgp/...``), so
the same bytes reach the same call sites at the same relative path.
``tests/test_companion_distribution.py`` hashes a moved member through
this resolver against a recorded SHA-256 to keep that literal.

The shape of the rule
---------------------
:data:`COMPANION_TREES` names DIRECTORIES, never filenames.  An
enumeration of files here would drift behind the tree the way
``package-data`` once drifted 52 files behind it; a directory rule cannot,
because a table added beside its siblings is already covered.  Moving the
next directory out is one entry in that tuple plus the ``git mv`` -- no
new call site, no new code path.

The refusals
------------
Both name a concrete breakage and both end in the command that fixes it:

* companion missing -- every radiation scheme and every Thompson run
  cannot read its tables, which on a bare ``pip install recast-woof`` should be
  impossible (it is a hard dependency), so the case this catches is an
  install someone edited: ``pip uninstall recast-woof-data``, a partially
  restored venv, a vendored tree copied without it.
* version skew -- the two distributions are cut from one commit and
  pinned ``==``, so a mismatch means a hand-installed sibling.  The tables
  are versioned data: reading 2.4.1's RRTMGP k-distribution under 2.5.0's
  radiation code is a silently different numerical setup, not a missing
  file, and that is exactly the class of error a certification capsule
  cannot see.
