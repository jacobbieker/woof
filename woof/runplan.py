"""A versioned plan in, a structured event stream out.

Every other front door in this package talks to a person: it prints a
resolved-config report, a progress line, a refusal sentence.  A program
driving woof as a subprocess -- a GUI, a scheduler, a fleet controller
-- has to read those same facts, and until now its only route to them
was to parse the prose.  Prose is not an interface.  It gets rewritten
for clarity, and the rewrite silently breaks the consumer.

``woof run-plan PLAN.json`` is the interface.  A caller writes ONE JSON
document naming which existing route to execute and which existing
config to execute it with, and gets back an append-only JSONL stream in
which every fact the human output carries is a typed field on a typed
event.  Nothing about the model changes: the plan is an ENVELOPE over
the config system, it is resolved by the same
:func:`woof.case_data.load_experiment_case` seam ``woof run`` uses,
and it is executed by the same :func:`woof.runtime.run_experiment`.
There is no second config format and no forked validation.

The three documents
-------------------

``gpuwm.run-plan.v1`` -- the plan.  ``schema``, ``name``, ``route``,
``config`` (``{"path": ...}`` or ``{"inline": "..."}``), and the
optional ``fetch`` / ``output_root`` / ``run_options``.  Unknown
top-level keys and unknown schema ids are refused, not ignored: a
dropped key runs a default under the name of your value.

``gpuwm.run-plan.event.v1`` -- one JSON object per line of
``<run_dir>/events.jsonl``, mirrored verbatim to stdout.  Every line
carries ``schema_version``, a monotonic ``sequence``, ``emitted_unix_ms``
and an ``event`` tag; the event's own fields are flattened alongside.
The tags are :data:`EVENT_TAGS`, and a ``warning`` event's own ``code``
is one of :data:`WARNING_CODES`.

``gpuwm.run-manifest.v1`` -- ``<run_dir>/run-manifest.json``, written
before any work starts.  It carries this process's pid and the absolute
path of every stream a consumer may want, INCLUDING the two the rest of
the package already owns.

Reattach: read the heartbeat, do not own the pipe
-------------------------------------------------

This module publishes no progress state of its own.
:mod:`woof.supervisor` already writes ``run-progress.json``
(``gpuwm.run-progress/v1``) atomically on every step, and it stays the
only writer of it: :class:`RunObserver` COMPOSES with
:class:`woof.supervisor.RuntimeHeartbeat` rather than replacing it, so
a run-plan run leaves exactly the same heartbeat a ``woof run`` leaves.

So a consumer that attaches to a run already in flight does three
things, in this order:

1. Read ``run-manifest.json`` for the paths and the pid.
2. Read ``run-progress.json`` for CURRENT state.  That file is the
   authoritative anchor -- it is atomically republished, it is what the
   supervisor's own recovery reads, and it is one small read rather
   than a replay.
3. Replay ``events.jsonl`` from byte zero for HISTORY (it is the
   complete record, never rotated or truncated), then tail it for live
   detail.

A consumer that treats the event stream as the anchor will be wrong
exactly once: after a crash between the last event flush and the
process exit.  The heartbeat is the thing that is durable by design.

Query modes
-----------

``--resolve``, ``--estimate`` and ``--probe`` answer a front end's three
pre-flight questions without running anything, each as one JSON document
on stdout.  They live here rather than in the front end because the
answers are derived from this package's own machinery -- the config
loaders, :mod:`woof.core.preflight`'s VRAM itemization,
:mod:`woof.doctor`'s estate checks -- and a front end that
reimplemented them would be reporting its own arithmetic under woof's
name.  Where this package has no measured number for something
(wall-time for an arbitrary configuration), the field is ``null`` with
its ``basis`` stated.  Nothing is estimated by guess.

Nothing silent
--------------

``resolved_plan`` carries ``automatic_resolutions``: one entry for every
value this pipeline chose on its own -- an omitted plan key taking its
default, a schema default filling an unspelled config key, a per-domain
timestep derived down the nest ratio chain.  A consumer can render that
list and a reader can see, before the run, every number nobody typed.

    that chain delivers the child-resolution statics a moving nest

    An AUTHORING door asks this before it emits a following nest, and

    whose chain seals no corridor, and the reader met the refusal at the

    answer.  A row placed on a chain whose preparation seals no corridor
    is launchable, and only its nest is refused.  A row placed on NO

    the function ``woof go`` itself calls before it considers anything

    is returned verbatim as ``launch_refusal`` (``None`` for every row
    that does reach a chain) so the authoring door can quote the run

    # own fetch stage first, and `initialize_real`'s per-domain floor is
    # downstream of the whole downloaded cycle.  So an mp=28 config with
    # external lateral boundaries on a machine without
    # QNWFA_QNIFA_SIGMA_MONTHLY.dat used to pass review, pay for 10-15 GB
    # of transfer and be refused afterwards.  It is refused HERE, on the
    # near side of the fetch and of the run root: `--resolve` is plan
    # review and answers with the sentence and both ways out, and a run

    at the preparer's own create-only refusal ("refusing existing

    ``statics_corridor`` adds the tenth, and it is where the HRRR chain
    answers a moving nest.  On the GFS chain the corridor flag rides the
    rw-wps prepare stage; here the root preparer knows nothing of the
    children, so the flag belongs to THIS stage -- the one holding
    ``--geog-root`` and the child geometries.  The caller derives the

    """What this plan will cost, from measured machinery only.

    VRAM comes from :mod:`woof.core.preflight`'s itemization -- the
    same arithmetic ``woof check`` reports, on the CPU, with no CUDA
    context created IN THIS PROCESS. One short-lived subprocess observes
    the local device for its non-pool terms, radiation workspace widths,
    and tile planner; its context dies with it. Output-frame
    COUNTS are exact.  Wall time is
    ``null``: this package has no measured rate for an arbitrary
    configuration, and a front end showing an invented duration would
    be showing woof's name on a number woof never measured.

    ``[tiles]`` REPLACES THE FORECAST TERM, through
    :func:`woof.core.preflight.estimate_phases` rather than the resident
    itemizer underneath it.  Every term ``estimate_experiment`` sums
    itemizes a domain RESIDENT in VRAM, so a streamed plan was quoted a
    figure for a run that was not going to happen -- and a front end that
    renders this document verbatim then reports "exceeds free VRAM" for
    exactly the small cards streaming exists to serve.  ``envelope_basis``
    says which of the two figures the caller got.

    The INGEST phase is deliberately not priced here (``source=None``):
    this document has never carried a preprocessing term and quietly
    growing one would move ``peak_envelope_bytes`` under callers who
    compare it against a card.  ``woof check`` is the surface that
    prices both phases.  The recorded forcing source is still named as
    the phases' ``boundary_source``, so the forecast term carries the
    hydrometeor boundary tables that source publishes, as the check's
    forecast term does.

    ONE FIGURE FOR ONE PLAN ON ONE CARD.  Every input the device
    contributes is a constant of the card -- its name, shader census,
    default stack limit, compile platform and capacity -- and the
    document carries each of them (``device_profile``,
    ``device_total_bytes``), so a reader can price the same plan through
    :func:`woof.core.preflight.estimate_experiment` on the stated
    device and get this figure to the byte, and two readings of one
    plan on one card are one figure.  The free-memory sample
    (``device_free_bytes``) is the one thing here that moves between
    readings; it reaches the ``[tiles]`` planner and nothing else, so a
    resident plan's figure never follows it, and it is stated so a
    streamed plan's two readings can be told apart by their receipts.

    THE picker document.  Front ends used to carry their own list of
    models -- three hand-written rows in one case -- which meant a
    source added to the registry was invisible until someone edited a
    GUI, and a row that changed maturity kept its old colour forever.
    This asks the registry instead, exactly as ``--catalog`` asks the
    renderer rather than transcribing its products.

    Every field below is COPIED from a registry table.  There is no
    dict keyed by model name and no branch on a source id anywhere in
    this function, which is what makes adding a model table work: a row
    appended to ``woof.source_adapters._ADAPTERS`` appears here with
    zero code change, and ``tests/test_runplan.py`` grafts one on to
    prove it.

    Three shapes are worth naming for whoever renders this:

    ``display_name`` is the registry's own DISPLAY-NAME column, and
    ``title`` now carries it too (it used to repeat ``source_id``, which
    is why every consumer showed raw ids and any front end that wanted a
    human name kept its own id-to-name lookup -- a per-model table).  A
    row that declares no name reads back as its id, so a grafted row
    still renders.  The name is not invented here: inventing it here
    would be the same forbidden table one repo to the left.

    ``credentials`` is the registry's CREDENTIAL column, resolved
    against THIS box: what the row declares it needs configured, where
    that lives here, whether it is there, and what breaks if it is not.
    A row that declares nothing says exactly that -- not "this source is
    public", which is a promise about a provider the registry cannot
    make.  Existence only ever leaves this door; the credential's value
    is never read.

    ``run_plan.intent_supported`` is narrower than ``maturity.runnable``
    and says so on every row.  The registry can decode far more sources
    than the run-plan INTENT door can drive from a point-and-cycle, and
    a picker that hid the difference would offer launches the resolver
    refuses.  Rows the intent cannot drive are still listed, with the
    engine's own reasons attached, because a truthful "not from here"
    is worth more than a short menu.

    Nothing here raises.  A registry lookup that fails puts its
    exception text in the affected row's ``error`` (or the envelope's,
    when the manifest itself is unavailable) and the document still
    prints -- the same shape :func:`render_catalog` uses for a box with
    no renderer.  A traceback out of a JSON front door is a defect.

    class, and the component-owned vertical bounds.  Owner design,
    2026-08-20: "why cant every model have multiple unique working
    default".

    This exists because a picker had no way to ask.  WOOF Studio ships
    a physics list hand-typed out of woof 1.7.1, which cannot know that
    the native HRRR route refuses every Kain-Fritsch suite, so it offers
    launches that refuse -- and the refusal a user then met named
    another suite that the same route refuses.  Both halves are the same
    missing object: nobody could ask what a source can actually run.

    :mod:`woof.physics_menu` owns the derivation; this function is the
    envelope, exactly as :func:`source_inventory` is the envelope over
    :func:`intent_drivability`.  There is no dict keyed by model name
    and no branch on a source id or a profile id anywhere in either, so
    a row appended to ``woof.source_adapters._ADAPTERS`` and a suite
    appended to ``woof.domain_wizard.WIZARD_PHYSICS_PROFILES`` both
    appear here with zero code change; ``tests/test_physics_menu.py``
    grafts one of each to prove it.

    Two shapes are worth naming for whoever renders this:

    ``profiles`` is the source-INDEPENDENT half -- what a suite runs,
    its nocturnal class, its registry maturity, the level-count window
    every one of its components accepts.  ``sources[].profiles`` is the
    per-source half and carries the six facts a picker needs per cell:
    ``profile_id``, ``admissible``, ``why_not`` (the route's own refusal
    sentence, verbatim), ``is_default``, ``day_only`` and ``maturity``.
    The two lists are parallel and in the same order, so a front end can
    zip them.

    ``sources[].nocturnal_remedy`` is the answer to "this suite meets a
    night window, now what" FOR THIS SOURCE.  It names a suite the
    source's route admits, and when that suite is the source's own
    default it says to stop passing the flag rather than naming an id
    that will change.  The wizard's refusal reads this same field, so
    the printed remedy and the menu cannot drift.

    Nothing here raises.  A lookup that fails puts its exception text in
    the affected row's ``error`` (or the envelope's) and the document
    still prints -- a traceback out of a JSON front door is a defect.
