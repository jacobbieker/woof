REQUEST_SCHEMA = "arwen.local-da-request.v1"
#: What a published case directory contains, as (filename, review key).
#: The WPS namelist is named for the experiment beside it because that is
#: the name the preparation owner reads (woof.go_cli.plan_from_config
#: derives "<config stem>.namelist.wps"); a bare "namelist.wps" made the
#: publisher and the preparation door disagree about one configuration and
#: every real launch stopped at its first stage.
PUBLISHED_FILES = (("experiment.toml", "experiment"),
                   ("experiment.namelist.wps", "wps"),
                   ("ensemble.toml", "ensemble"))
#: Where the companion protocol is written down, relative to the tree.
COMPANION_DOCUMENT = "docs/local-da-companion-protocol.md"
#: Every top-level field of a review document, in one place so the door,
#: the discovery contract and the written protocol cannot drift apart.
#: :func:`_build_plan` checks its own result against this before the
#: document leaves the door, so a field added without a line in the
#: protocol fails a test rather than a desktop.
REVIEW_FIELDS = ("alternatives", "analysis_times", "background", "cadence_overrun",

#: Every key of one ``alternatives`` row, in one place, because the
#: companion protocol tells a consumer to draw every row and two of the
#: rows the ladder can produce were never priced at all: the run that
#: stopped before the rung could be priced still has to say so in the
#: same shape as a rung that was.  An unpriced row carries ``priced``
#: false and ``None`` in every price field; a consumer reads ``priced``
#: and never a missing key.  :func:`_ladder_row` builds every row and
#: refuses one that drifts from this roster, so a row added on one path
#: and not the other fails a test rather than a desktop.
ALTERNATIVE_FIELDS = ("cadence", "cycle_seconds", "cycles", "dx_m", "fits",

#: Optional responses to an estimated overrun, beside the comparison they
#: answer. They never change the requested configuration or gate launch.
#: Every ladder row carries reasons and remedies in matching index order.
REMEDY_HOST_MEMORY = "Declare more host memory with --host-gib, or select a smaller region."
REMEDY_CARD_MEMORY = "Declare more free memory with --free-gib, or select a smaller region."
REMEDY_TIME_BUDGET = "Raise the time budget with --budget-seconds, or shorten the forecast."
REMEDY_CADENCE = "Use fewer members, a coarser nest, or a longer cadence."
REMEDY_FORCING = "Shorten the cycle run or select a later initial cycle."
#: Every refusal code this door can print, in three groups, because what
#: a consumer must do next differs by group and by nothing else.  All of
#: them print one JSON document with ``schema``, ``error``, ``code``,
#: ``details`` and ``forecast_started``; a refusal is told apart from a
#: review by the presence of ``error``, never by ``schema``, which both
#: carry.
#:
#: REVIEW means the request was decided before anything was written,
#: fetched or allocated: no case directory, no execution document.
#:
#: LAUNCH means a published case failed an integrity check that runs
#: before its execution document is opened, so a case directory exists,
#: the refusal writes no execution document, and ``forecast_started`` is
#: false.
#:
#: RUN means a published case failed a check that runs after its execution
#: document is opened, so the case directory holds an
#: ``arwen.local-da-execution.v1`` document with status ``FAILED`` and
#: ``forecast_started`` says whether a member had already begun, which it
#: can.  A run refusal is a coded run failure, and naming it that way is
#: deliberate: these checks read what an earlier stage published, so they
#: cannot be made at plan review, and a consumer that was told they could
#: would look for a document that is there and trust a flag that is not.
#:
#: :data:`FALLBACK_REFUSAL_CODE` carries anything the door did not raise
#: itself, so a consumer always has an arm to land in; its group is
#: whichever stage it escaped from, so read the case directory.
#:
#: ``tests/test_local_da_plan.py`` checks this roster against every
#: ``code=`` literal in the three modules, classified by the function that
#: raises it, and against the written protocol, so a code added without a
#: line in the protocol, or a check moved across the execution document,
#: fails a test rather than a desktop.
