"""Run a hash-bound RW-WPS prepared hierarchy through GPUWM.

The public source adapters already publish one verified prepared cache per
domain.  This launcher restores that complete tree and hands it to GPUWM's
existing ``DomainNode``/``NestCoupler``/``execute_experiment`` engine.  It
does not implement another integrator and it does not flatten a nest tree
into the single-domain benchmark runner.

The experiment TOML remains the typed authority for arbitrary supported
static one-way layouts and per-domain physics.  In particular, MP8 outer
domains may feed MP18 inner domains through the existing explicit
``mp8-to-mp18-mass-diagnosed-v1`` policy.  Implemented configurations that do
not yet have retained acceptance evidence are reported as warnings, never as
consent gates.

    A plain ``before != after`` conflated two unrelated events, and the

    four-hour two-domain forecast completed all 240 outer steps, wrote 62
    ``wrfout`` frames, and then died on ``forecast implementation changed
    during execution``.  Nothing had changed -- none of the five hashed
    files was modified, HEAD had not moved, no commit was made -- but the
    ``git rev-parse`` at the end of the run failed to run, which flips
    ``git_commit``/``git_tree`` from their real values to ``None``, and
    ``None != "8f3c..."`` is a difference the equality test cannot tell

    * ``git_commit``/``git_tree`` are compared only when BOTH ends
      resolved them.  ``None`` is unambiguous here (see
      :func:`_git_head_query`), so "git could not answer at one end" is
      reported as what it is -- an unanswered question -- rather than as
      a changed answer.

    That is narrower than the old test in exactly one case: a commit that
    lands mid-run, touches none of the five hashed files, AND coincides
    with a git failure at one end.  Every other real change still fails:

    """The live restart fingerprint for a checkpoint written after a move.

    Relocation BOUNDS are byte-inert on a fingerprint; an executed MOVE
    binds, by folding each move receipt into the value
    (:func:`woof.core.nest_relocation.mark_fingerprint_across_move`).
    So a fresh build's identity is its own base folded over the history
    the checkpoint records, and that is the ordinary answer.

    THE CASE THIS FUNCTION EXISTS FOR.  The chain is anchored to the base
    the WRITING run computed, so folding it reproduces the stored value
    only when this build computes the identical base.  Anything that
    moves the base -- a widened exemption as much as a changed setting --
    makes EVERY relocation checkpoint ever written unresumable, with a
    message blaming the move history rather than the base.  Measured: a
    checkpoint refused even with its own original configuration restored
    exactly.

    The header carries the components the writing run hashed, so its base
    is recoverable: drop the ``relocation`` block (added as the chain was
    marked) and hash the rest.  Two things must then BOTH hold before
    that base is adopted.

    1. Folding the SAME records from THAT base reproduces the stored
       fingerprint.  This proves the checkpoint is self-consistent -- a
       forged or truncated chain cannot pass, because the records hash
       one-way into the result.

    2. The stored components and the live ones agree once both are
       normalised under this build's rules
       (:func:`woof.io.restart._identity_matches_under_current_rules`).

    (1) ALONE IS NOT IDENTITY, and adopting the replayed value on its
    strength was a hole rather than a widening: the replayed value is by
    construction the stored fingerprint, so assigning it hands the gate
    in :mod:`woof.io.restart` the header to compare against itself --
    and that gate is the only place a tree's preparation receipt, cache
    content, execution plan and runtime source identity are ever
    compared.  A checkpoint from a DIFFERENT prepared tree would have
    resumed silently, because its chain is self-consistent too: the
    chain proves the move history was not tampered with and says nothing
    about which tree made the moves.  (2) is what a foreign tree fails
    and what the widened-exemption case passes.
