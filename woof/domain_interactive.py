"""The short version of ``woof domain``, for a person at a terminal.

``woof domain`` takes three required flags, so typing it bare answers
with argparse's usage dump and exit 2.  That is the correct answer to a
script and the wrong one to a person: the owner's reaction to it was
"so we don't have an easier way of doing it?".  There is now.  On a
terminal, bare ``woof domain`` asks four questions and runs.

Two rules shape everything here.

**The prompts collect values; they do not build anything.**  A session
produces an ordinary ``argv`` list of the same flags a user could have
typed, and that list goes through the same parser into the same
:func:`woof.domain_wizard.domain_main`.  There is no second sizing
path, no second validator, and no way for the two front doors to drift
into emitting different files -- the equivalence is by construction
rather than by a test that has to keep noticing.  The session also
prints the command it assembled, so the flag form is learned by using
the short one.

**Interactivity is layered exactly like verbosity.**  A hidden prompt
that a CI job can block on is a worse failure than a usage error, so
the prompt session requires BOTH stdin and stdout to be terminals.
Redirected, piped, or under a scheduler, bare ``woof domain`` keeps
today's behaviour to the letter: usage on stderr, exit 2.  Any flag at
all also means the caller knows what they want, and the old path runs
untouched.

#: can fetch with no account and no manual step: HRRR is CONUS-only and
#: ERA5's default wizard provider, Copernicus CDS, needs a personal key.
#: The flag default stays era5 --

#:
#: ``auto`` -- the deepest ladder that fits the card, four domains down
#: to 500 m on a large one -- is the right answer for someone who asked
#: for a ladder; it is the wrong DEFAULT, because ``woof go`` drives
#: the SINGLE-domain runner and refuses a tree, so a default-following
#: reader was handed a file the other new front door would not take.
#: Two features that do not compose is not a feature.  This door ruled
#: that first; the flags door's ``--ladder`` default was still ``auto``
#: until the 4090 user-zero run met the same refusal there, and now
#: both doors default to this shape (register_cli in
#: :mod:`woof.domain_wizard`).  Nests are explicit opt-in on either:
#: a deeper preset, ``auto``, or ``--root-dx``/``--chain``.
#:
#: This is exactly the shape ``docs/public/FIRST-LIGHT.md`` section 3a's
#: worked first run uses (``--ladder 12``), so the short path emits
#: the documented first run rather than a private variant of it.
DEFAULT_LADDER = "12"

#: The physics a bare session emits, per source.
#:
#: Without one the wizard emits the product default suite, which is not
#: one of the shipped runner profiles, so the prepared single-domain
#: runner refuses it and ``woof go`` refuses it earlier and says so.
#: The short front door therefore names a profile, and names the
#: strongest one its source's route can actually RUN.  For gfs and era5
#: that is ``morrison-mp10-...``, the registry's only ``wrf-matched-run``
#: template with full lw+sw radiation and FIRST-LIGHT section 3a's own
#: worked example.
#:
#: For hrrr it is not.  This table gave hrrr the Morrison suite too, and
#: that suite is refused at emission by the nested HRRR route's own
#: physics gate -- ``d01 cu_physics=1 (the route requires 0)``, because
#: HRRR's 3 km grid is convection permitting and Kain-Fritsch would
#: parameterize convection it already resolves.  A bare hrrr session
#: therefore emitted a config its own route would not take.  The entry is
#: now the strongest ROUTE-ADMISSIBLE full-radiation suite: Thompson mp8
#: with RTE+RRTMGP longwave and shortwave and no cumulus, which matches
#: :data:`woof.domain_wizard.HRRR_DEFAULT_PROFILE` -- the two doors
#: agree, as they must.  The same composition on the legacy RRTMG
#: engines, which is what this entry named while that was the route's
#: default, stays selectable by id.
#:
#: ``tests/test_domain_interactive.py`` re-derives every entry from the
#: generated registry -- offered by that source's route, admitted by that
#: route's physics gate, and the strongest maturity that survives both --
#: so this table cannot quietly outlive the facts it is quoting.
