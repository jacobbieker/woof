"""The moisture floors an initialization applied, carried into its proof.

WHAT WAS MISSING.  :func:`woof.ingest.real.initialize_real` floors water
vapour in more than one place, and it already writes down what it did:
``RealInitResult.surface_moisture_floor`` records the cells of the
published surface mixing ratio that WPS's overshooting ``sixteen_pt``
operator drove below WRF's ``qv_min_value`` on the FLAG_SH lane, and any
further ``*_moisture_floor`` receipt the ingest grows joins it on the same
result.  Those receipts reached memory and stderr and stopped there.  A
prepared bundle carries a ``proof.json``, the run that consumes it is a
different process, and nothing in the document said whether a floor had
fired -- so a forecast whose initial vapour field was modified on the way
in was indistinguishable, afterwards, from one that was not.

THE ABSENCE AND THE ZERO ARE DIFFERENT FACTS, and keeping them apart is
the whole job of this module.

  1. A FLOOR THAT DID NOT FIRE is the usual case and it is STATED:
     ``fired`` is ``False`` and the floor's name is in the document.  An
     absent key would have been read as "this preparation predates the
     receipt", which is a different claim and one no reader could check.

  2. A FLOOR THAT FIRED carries the ingest's own receipt verbatim beside
     ``fired: True`` -- how many cells, how far below the floor they
     were -- because "some vapour was modified" without the magnitude is
     a fact nobody can act on.

  3. And a third, so the second is never guessed at: a writer holding an
     initialization result that declares no floor field at all -- a route
     whose state came back from an archived frame, a stand-in with no
     ingest behind it.  ``recorded`` is ``False`` and there is no
     ``fired``: "not recorded" and "nothing was floored" are not the same
     sentence.  Each caller supplies its own ``when_unrecorded`` naming
     what its route actually knows, and a caller that cannot state one has
     found a gap rather than a formatting problem, which is why the
     argument is required and has no default.

WHICH FLOORS ARE REPORTED IS NOT A LIST HERE.  It is read off the result
with :func:`dataclasses.fields`: every field whose name ends in
``_moisture_floor``.  A second floor added to ``RealInitResult`` -- the
prognostic-column floor the use_sh_qv lane needs, for one -- appears in
every proof this module writes with no edit here and no edit at the six
proof writers, which is the only arrangement under which the next floor
cannot be dropped the way the first one was.

WHY A MODULE RATHER THAN A HELPER IN ``real.py``.  The writers are proof
assemblers -- :mod:`woof.era5_direct`, :mod:`woof.gfs_direct`,
:mod:`woof.mapped_direct` -- and a proof writer should not have to
import the GPU ingest to name what the ingest recorded.  This module
imports nothing but the standard library.
