"""The cross-process NOMADS rate governor, spoken by the Python transport.

NOMADS is a shared public service behind Akamai, and it answers a caller
who asks too fast with an over-rate-limit page and, eventually, an IP
block.  The vendored Rust fetch backbone has always paced itself against
a *node-wide* state file, so any number of concurrent ``rw_fetch``
processes on one machine still space their NOMADS requests.

The Python transports did not.  ``woof fetch --engine python`` (and
``--engine auto`` on a machine where the backbone is not built) went
straight to :mod:`urllib`, and the HRRR range downloader ran eight
worker threads doing it.  A user scripting a handful of parallel fetches
could therefore be rate-limited or banned while believing a governor was
in force -- and a Rust process and a Python process fetching side by
side paced only half the traffic.

This module is the same governor, in Python, over the *same files*:

* the same state path (``RUSTWX_NOMADS_RATE_STATE``, else
  ``<temp>/rustwx_nomads_rate_limit.state``);
* the same ``key=value`` body (``last_request_ms``, ``cooldown_until_ms``);
* the same sentinel lock beside it, the same 120 s staleness rule, the
  same dead-PID recovery where the platform can prove death;
* the same defaults -- 2.5 s between requests, a 15 minute cooldown once
  an over-rate-limit answer is seen -- and the same
  ``RUSTWX_NOMADS_MIN_INTERVAL_MS`` / ``RUSTWX_NOMADS_COOLDOWN_MS``
  overrides.

So a Rust fetch and a Python fetch on one node now share one pacer
rather than running two independent ones.

Two deliberate differences, both **stricter** than the Rust side, never
looser -- the governor's job is to protect a public service, so every
ambiguity here resolves towards waiting:

1. A state file that exists but does not parse is treated as "a request
   just happened", not as an empty state.  Corruption must not become
   permission to send.
2. When the shared state cannot be written, the request still waits out
   the minimum gap locally before proceeding.  Failing to record a
   request must not let the next process send immediately either.

Only ``nomads.ncep.noaa.gov`` is paced.  The S3 mirrors WOOF prefers
for HRRR are not rate limited in this way and are left alone, exactly as
the Rust client leaves them alone.
