"""The long time step each domain's ground and crest-level wind allow.

THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR.  The acoustic substep rule
(:mod:`woof.acoustic_adaptation`) was measured under cross-ridge winds of
10 to 25 m/s.  Under a jet at crest height the same ground stops runs that
rule leaves alone: at 1 km, 5.5 and 6.5 km crests of slope 0.6 to 0.65
stopped on four substeps under 50 to 60 m/s, and at 3 km, 4.5 and 5 km
crests of slope 0.4 under 60 to 70 m/s stopped within two minutes on four
AND six substeps.  There no substep count is the remedy; the long step
is.

MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED.  :data:`MAP_PATH` is the engine's own map: a bell
ridge across the grid in a uniform cross-ridge wind, integrated for half
an hour through the production ``step()`` with the generated dynamics
(the 49-level ladder, the etac the vertical survey derives for the crest,
``epssm`` 0.5, ``smdiv``/``emdiv``, ``w_damping``, the slope-tapered
sixth-order filter, the Rayleigh lid), at 500 m to 12 km, crests of 1.5
to 8.85 km and winds of 20 to 100 m/s.  Each row is one spacing, crest
height, grid-read steepest slope and substep count; for each crest-level
wind it holds the longest step, in seconds per kilometre of grid spacing,
that ran without stopping and without its vertical velocity passing four
times the wind times the slope plus 20 m/s.  ``None`` means no measured
step held.  The probe domain is periodic and 96 to 256 columns wide, so
from 50 m/s up the flow can come back round to the ridge inside the half
hour; every step held there was run again on a domain the flow cannot
wrap, and lowered to what held on it (at 1 km, a 4.5 km crest of slope
0.4 held 5 s/km at 90 and 100 m/s on 96 columns and stopped within
fifteen minutes on 1024).  Then every pair the rule picks at 1 and 3 km
from the generated step under 40 to 80 m/s ran three hours on a ridge
whose flow cannot wrap the domain in that time: 135 of 142 held, and
where one stopped the row now holds the step that held three hours
there, or nothing.

LONGER STEPS AT 3 KM.  Adaptive 3 km runs take steps past the ladder's
15 s, so the 3 km rows of crests 1.5 to 4.5 km and slopes up to 0.4 were
also tried from 40 s down to 20 s at 20 to 90 m/s on four and six
substeps (``tools/terrain_clock_probe.py extend``, which rebuilds these
ridges row key for row key), each step held that way run three hours.
238 of the 336 cells held a step of 20 to 40 s; four substeps never held
40 s, and under a 4.5 km crest of slope 0.36 only 20 m/s held more than
15 s on four.  A row records the longest step tried at each wind
(``top_s_per_km``, the ladder's top where it records none), and a cell
whose entry is shorter than that saw a longer step stop.  That is read
cell by cell: a reading takes every row as gentle as the domain's ground
or gentler and every wind up to its own, and where any of those cells
saw a longer step stop, the shortest such entry caps the step.  So 3 km
ground steeper than the extended rows (0.41 and up, tried to 15 s) is
capped by the stops its gentler rows saw at 20 s and longer, the 100 m/s
column by those seen at 90 m/s, and a spacing between 2 and 3 km by its
3 km rows.  A stop seen under a lower crest counts too, past the longest
step the domain's own crest was tried at: 3 km crests above 4.5 km were
tried only to 15 s, and a longer step seen to stop under the 4.5 km and
lower crests at the same slope and wind caps them there, since the
taller the crest the thinner the layer over it.  Only where no cell read
saw a step stop is a longer step left alone, and a cap never lengthens
the adaptive clock's own longest step.  Over the map:

* at 3 km the generated 15 s step holds every wind to 90 m/s on slopes
  to about 0.25 under crests to 4.5 km.  Steeper ground needs a shorter
  step from 40 to 80 m/s: under a 4.5 km crest a slope of 0.41 holds
  4.0 s/km at 50 m/s on four substeps and 4.5 on six, and 3.0 and 3.5
  at 100;
* at 1 km six substeps hold the generated 5 s step to 90 m/s on slopes
  to about 0.55 under crests to 4.5 km, to 70 m/s on slopes to about
  0.65 under a 5.5 km crest and to 60 m/s on slopes to about 0.75 under
  a 6.5 km crest.  Steeper ground needs a shorter step from 50 to 80 m/s,
  and slopes near 1 from 30;
* the taller the crest, the thinner the layer over it and the lower the
  wind past which no measured step holds at all: at 3 km, 80 m/s under a
  5.5 km crest, 70 under 6.5 km, 60 under 8 km and 40 under 8.85 km.
  There the layer, not the step, is the limit.

WHAT THIS DOES.  Each domain is read for its steepest slope (the reading
the substep rule takes), its crest height (its highest ground) and its
crest-level wind: the strongest wind its start state and boundary data
carry over the forecast window, from the ground up to the first model
level at or above the crest height.  The speed is taken whole, not its
component across the ground, because the wind turns over a forecast and
real ground faces every way; that is the conservative reading.  The map
is read on its conservative side (the next steeper slope, taller crest,
stronger wind and both neighbouring spacings) and the domain runs the
cheapest pair it holds: the smallest whole division of its configured step,
then the fewest substeps that hold at it.  A domain the map holds as
configured runs exactly as configured.  The step is only ever divided by a
whole number, so every cadence that was a whole number of steps stays
one; a nest's step ratio grows by the division its parent does not
already give it.  Under the adaptive clock the held step becomes a
ceiling on ``max_time_step``, unless no cell read saw a step stop: past
the longest step measured on held ground, the adaptive clock's own limits
govern.  Past the strongest wind the map holds a step at, the most stable
pair measured is the ceiling.  A ceiling only ever shortens the step: one
at or above the clock's own longest step (``max_time_step``, or WRF's
8 x dx fill-in where it is -1) is not written, so ground the map measured
no further than it held never runs a longer step than it would without
the map.  The run's ``terrain_clock`` record states the longest step
tried, per spacing and for each domain's reading, and the shortest entry
under a stop it read and the crest that entry was measured under.

A FIXED STEP reads the same map.  At 3 km a fixed step of 15 s or less
(the domain wizard writes 15 s) reads exactly as it did before the 3 km
rows were extended, since no entry under 15 s moved.  A fixed 3 km step
above 15 s over ground where 20 s was seen to stop is moved to six
substeps or divided: under a 3.9 km crest of slope 0.36, a fixed 18 s
runs on six substeps instead of four at 30 m/s and is halved to 9 s on
four from 40 m/s, and a fixed 20 s likewise runs on six at 30 m/s and
is halved to 10 s from 40 m/s.
