"""WRF-grade per-step progress: one line per model step, and events.

Why this module exists
----------------------

A user driving this package from his own script reported the gap in one
sentence: the simulation "only prints every 20 seconds and doesnt show
what time step the model is actually on, just the most recently output
frame".  Both halves were true.  The forecast runners republished
``progress.json`` on their own throttle (every sixtieth step) and
``woof go`` printed a stopwatch heartbeat every twenty seconds naming
whatever that file last said.  So a caller could not answer either of
the two questions a driving script actually asks:

* **where is the run?**  Not "some frame landed a while ago" -- which
  model step, on which domain, at which valid time, and how long that
  step took.
* **is this frame safe to open?**  A size or mtime check races the
  writer.  The history writer's own publication is already atomic --
  fsync, self-validate, ``os.replace`` onto the final name, with the
  in-flight temporary hidden behind a leading dot so a ``wrfout_*``
  glob cannot see it -- but that was a property of the code and not a
  documented signal, so every consumer invented its own poll.  One
  measured consequence in this tree: reaching an 89 s time-to-first-plot
  took an EXTERNAL process polling frames for a completion attribute,
  reimplementing a hook the writer already raises.

WRF answers both, and it answers them the same way it has for twenty
years: one ``Timing for main:`` line per model time step per domain, one
``Timing for Writing`` line for every history and restart file it
publishes.  This module matches that grammar rather than inventing one,
so a script that already reads ``rsl.out.0000`` needs a new path and not
a new parser.

The three streams
-----------------

**Text**, on stdout, in WRF's own sentences::

    Timing for main: time 2026-08-15_00:00:12 on domain   1:     0.06382 elapsed seconds  step 1
    Timing for Writing wrfout_d01_2026-08-15_00:00:00 for domain   1:     0.24310 elapsed seconds
    Timing for Writing restart for domain   1:     1.51200 elapsed seconds
    d02 2026-08-15_00:00:00 woof: domain start
    d02 2026-08-15_01:00:00 woof: domain end, 240 steps
    woof: SUCCESS COMPLETE SIMULATION, 300 steps, 182.4 wall seconds

The step index after ``elapsed seconds`` is the one field WRF does not
print and the reporting script asked for.  It is appended AFTER the WRF
sentence on purpose: a prefix-matching WRF parser is unaffected.

**JSONL**, one object per line, at ``<outdir>/progress.jsonl``.  Every
text line has exactly one record and the record carries the text it
printed under ``text``, so the two streams cannot disagree about what
happened -- they are one emit.  ``sequence`` is dense and monotonic, so
a consumer can detect loss rather than assume none.

**Frame markers**, at ``<outdir>/ready/<frame-name>.json``.  See
:func:`write_frame_marker` for exactly what the marker guarantees.

What this module deliberately does NOT do
-----------------------------------------

It never synchronises a device.  The per-step wall time is a
``perf_counter`` pair the executor takes around the step it was already
taking; a "true" per-step GPU time would need a stream synchronise per
step, which would serialise the pipeline the timing exists to observe.
The number reported is therefore WRF's number -- host wall time across
the step's launches -- and that is the one a progress display wants.

It is also not a replacement for anything.  ``run-progress.json``
(:mod:`woof.supervisor`) stays the durable reattach anchor,
``progress.json`` stays the coarse stage sample, and
``events.jsonl`` (:mod:`woof.runplan`) stays the plan-level event
stream.  This is the per-step layer none of them had.

#: One JSONL line per event, at this schema.

#: v2 adds one event tag, ``phase``, and one field on ``run_end``
#: (``first_step_excess_seconds``).  v3 adds the six :data:`NEST_EVENTS`
#: tags and nothing else.  Nothing an older version emitted changed
#: shape, so a v3 stream differs from a v2 stream only by carrying more
#: -- but the schema string moves anyway, because a consumer meeting a
#: tag it was never told about must refuse loudly rather than skip it,
#: and refusing on the schema is how it does that.
STEP_LOG_SCHEMA = "gpuwm.step-log/v3"

#: What an ADAPTIVE-timestep run emits instead.  v4 adds one field,
#: ``dt``, to the ``step`` record and changes nothing else.
#:
#: Why a run picks its schema instead of the tree picking one: under a
#: fixed step the timestep is a constant sitting in the experiment
#: config, so a ``dt`` on every step record would be noise, and emitting
#: it would move EVERY run to v4 and make a v3-only consumer refuse
#: streams whose shape it actually understands perfectly.  Under an
#: adaptive step the timestep is the run's most diagnostic quantity and
#: it is otherwise UNRECOVERABLE: differencing ``model_seconds`` is the
#: only other route, and :meth:`StepLog.domain_step` already documents
#: why that derivation is wrong for a delayed-start nest.
#:
#: So a fixed run's stream stays byte-for-byte what it was and every
#: existing consumer keeps working; an adaptive run declares v4, and a
#: v3-only consumer refuses it loudly, which is exactly the contract the

#: What the tree does to ITSELF, as opposed to what it computes.
#:
#: The gap these close: a run could relocate a nest across half a state,
#: retire an episode and re-arm the slot, and the per-step stream said
#: nothing at all.  Those decisions lived only in
#: ``relocation_receipts.json`` and ``spawn_receipts.json``, files
#: written for a post-mortem, so anything watching a run LIVE could not
#: draw the tree it was watching -- the nest rectangles could not move,
#: the storm track could not be drawn, and an episode beginning or
#: ending was invisible until the run was over.
#:
#: The spellings are a published contract, not an internal name: they
#: are what a live consumer switches on.  What each one means:
#:
#: ``nest_spawned``      a dormant nest's trigger fired and the child was
#:                       materialized -- the birth AND the activation,
#:                       which on this engine are one leg-boundary act.
#: ``nest_retired``      a live episode stopped participating; the domain
#:                       leaves the next leg's tree.
#: ``nest_rearmed``      a retired slot re-opened for a later episode.
#:                       Nothing exists yet, so it carries no position.
#: ``nest_moved``        a follower executed a relocation, carrying the
#:                       placement it left and the one it took.
#: ``containment_moved`` the mover's PARENT slid to keep the mover
#:                       contained, with the mover earth-fixed under it.
#: ``track_fix``         one tracker fix as the track file records it.
#:
#: A relocation that HELD is deliberately not an event.  A hold is the
#: absence of a move, it happens at every cadence boundary a storm sits
#: still, and the receipts already carry every one of them with the
#: reason; a live map has nothing to redraw for it.
