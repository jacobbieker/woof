"""Bounded-concurrency transfer pool for multi-file acquisitions.

The scaling study (ARWEN-PRESIM-SCALING-2026-08-16) measured the cold
fetch stage at 0.47 s + 3.14 s **per file**, serial: file count dominates
and bytes barely matter, because each request spends most of its wall
clock waiting on the service, not on the pipe.  Sources that publish one
object per field per lead (ICON-EU: 251 objects per state; GEM: 351)
turn that per-file constant into the whole pre-sim budget.  The remedy
is to keep several requests in flight, bounded, without weakening a
single integrity property of the serial transport.

This module is the one shared implementation of that remedy.  It moves
no bytes itself: a :class:`TransferJob` carries an ``action`` callable
that downloads AND verifies one file exactly as the serial loop did
(envelope walk, record bar, sha256 -- whatever that route's bars are),
returning the manifest entry for it.  What the pool owns is scheduling
and bookkeeping:

* **Bounded workers.**  ``workers`` file transfers at most are in
  flight; :data:`DEFAULT_FILE_WORKERS` is the engine default and 1 is
  the serial transport, byte-for-byte the old loop (no threads are
  created at all).
* **Per-host politeness.**  A same-host cap bounds how many of those
  workers may target one host.  NOMADS is capped at
  :data:`NOMADS_FILE_WORKER_CAP` regardless of the pool size: the
  service is fragile, server-limited, and every request to it is
  *additionally* paced by the node-wide 2.5 s governor
  (:mod:`woof.nomads_governor`), which this pool never bypasses --
  concurrency there only overlaps in-flight service time, it never
  raises the request rate.  A host's files take its slots in
  submission order (:class:`_HostTurns`), so a capped host moves a
  window's leads first to last.
* **In-order admission.**  ``on_admitted`` fires on the caller's
  thread, in submission order, as the verified prefix grows -- so a
  route's per-file manifest publication keeps its exact serial
  semantics (an interrupted fetch still records a contiguous verified
  prefix, and receipts are never written from two threads).
* **Fail-closed per file, and at once.**  The first job to fail, in
  whatever order the jobs finish, fails the whole request: jobs not
  yet started are cancelled, jobs in flight are told to stop (a
  backbone subprocess is terminated, a Python transport gives up at
  its next chunk through :func:`raise_if_stopped` and in the middle of
  a retry or governor wait through :func:`sleep_unless_stopped`), and
  once they have wound down the original refusal -- whose message
  names the file -- is re-raised unchanged.  Files that landed stay on disk,
  unclaimed by any receipt past the admitted prefix, and the next run
  re-verifies them under the ordinary bars.
* **An accurate receipt.**  Files, bytes, workers requested and
  effective, the per-host caps that actually bound this run, wall
  seconds, the serial model (the sum of per-file seconds), and the
  effective speedup against it.

    """Run every job; return ``(entries, receipt)`` in submission order.

    ``on_admitted(index, entry)`` fires on the caller's thread, in
    submission order, as each verified file joins the contiguous
    admitted prefix -- publish receipts there exactly as the serial
    loop did after each file.

    ``monitor`` is a :class:`woof.progress.TransferMonitor` that hears
    the whole request up front and then the start and the end of every
    job, so a request with six files in flight says which ones, and out
    of how many, as it goes instead of only when each one lands.  The
    transfer call sites always pass one; the ladder PROBE pass
    deliberately does not, because a HEAD is not a download and
    announcing eight of them would bury the eight lines that matter.

    Failure semantics: the FIRST job to fail, in completion order, ends
    the request.  Jobs not yet started are cancelled and never start,
    jobs in flight are told to stop (see :class:`_Stop`), and once they
    have wound down the contiguous verified prefix is admitted and the
    original exception is re-raised unchanged.  A ``KeyboardInterrupt``
    -- whether it lands here or inside an action -- stops the rest the
    same way and propagates, so route-level interrupt handling keeps
    working unchanged.
