"""The name a checkpoint gives every scheme, and the gate that asks first.

A restart file records the identity of every scheme that integrated it, so
a resume onto a different implementation fails BEFORE it restores rather
than continuing a trajectory that is not the one it claims.  The tables
below are those identities, and the gate below them is the question
``validate_run_config`` asks at plan review: can the checkpoint writer name
everything this configuration selected?

WHY THEY LIVE IN A TOP-LEVEL MODULE rather than beside the writer in
:mod:`woof.io.restart`, which is where they were written and where every
reader in the tree still spells them.  The gate is called from
:func:`woof.config.validate_run_config` -- every door's plan review --
and ``woof/config.py`` ships in distributions that stage no forecast
executor and therefore no ``woof/io`` at all: the standalone RW-WPS
preprocessing project stages ``woof/*.py`` and an explicit handful of
``woof/io`` modules, and ``restart.py`` is deliberately not one of them
(it reaches the CUDA side).  A gate imported out of ``woof.io.restart``
is therefore unresolvable in a preparation-only install -- the plan review
every front door runs would raise ``ModuleNotFoundError`` on a
configuration it should simply have accepted.

Answering that with an exception in the packaging tables would have left
the same import waiting to be reached at run time.  These are pure
configuration facts -- integers, strings and dicts -- so the module that
holds them imports nothing from ``woof.io``, nothing from CuPy, and
resolves its two configuration helpers inside the one function that needs
them.  It stages, and imports, wherever ``woof/config.py`` does.

:mod:`woof.io.restart` imports every name here and re-exports it under
the spelling the tree already uses, so there is ONE copy of each table and
``woof.io.restart.MICROPHYSICS_ALGORITHM_IDENTITIES`` is that copy.

from __future__ import annotations

#: THE table of output-only RunConfig switches: each one decides what a
#: forecast WRITES, never what it integrates, so it may differ between
#: the run that wrote a checkpoint and the run that resumes it, and
#: between the run that prepared a cache and the run that reads it.
#: Every place that asks "does this switch change the model" reads this
#: one set: the member restart walk and the configuration digest in
#: :mod:`woof.io.restart` (re-exported there under this name), the tree
#: restart identity comparison beside them, and the prepared-cache
#: identity in :mod:`woof.ingest.prepared_cache`.  Two copies of this
#: list drifted once already: the prepared cache knew only the first
#: member, so switching any of the other three on refused an unchanged
#: cache and forced a second preparation of identical arrays.
#:
#: Membership is a proof, not a label: the switch reads model state and
#: writes only its own diagnostic buffers.
#:
#: * ``nwp_diagnostics`` -- inertness pinned by tests/test_uh_lifecycle.py;
#:   its accumulator payloads are tolerant in both directions (missing in
#:   the file restores as zeros with a note; present under a
#:   diagnostics-off resume is dropped with a note).
#: * ``tke_budget`` -- the accumulator writes only its own scratch
#:   (tests/test_tke_budget.py).
#: * ``sase_flux_diag`` -- four history buffers filled from arrays the
#:   SASE step already holds (tests/test_sase_gpu.py, every prognostic
#:   byte-identical with the switch on).
#: * ``hmix_k_diag`` -- two history buffers copied from the eddy
#:   viscosity the run's own mixing producer computed; nothing reads them
#:   back (tests/test_sase_gpu.py, every prognostic byte-identical with
#:   the switch on, under both producers).
#:
#: A newly switched-on diagnostic that a positive PBL cadence carries
#: between steps restores as zeros, its cold value, and is refilled by
#: the next due step.  The physics selectors beside them
#: (``sase_moist_n2``, ``sase_stable_dissipation``,
#: ``sase_additive_dissipation``) move the trajectory and are NOT here.
CONFIG_DIAGNOSTIC_FIELDS = frozenset(
    {"nwp_diagnostics", "tke_budget", "sase_flux_diag", "hmix_k_diag"})

#: Versioned semantic identities.  These are deliberately explicit instead
#: of inferred from scheme numbers: a trajectory-changing implementation or
#: policy change must advance its tag, causing an incompatible restart to
#: fail before restore.  Asset bytes and resolved per-run values are bound
#: by the writer in :mod:`woof.io.restart`.
#:
#: WHAT DOES NOT GET A ROW, so the next reader does not add one and call
#: it completeness.  A row exists for an input CONFIG CANNOT PROVE: a
#: resolved callable, packaged asset bytes, a resolved cadence, a policy
#: chosen at setup.  Every selector config DOES prove is already bound,
#: twice: the writer's ``configuration_sha256`` hashes the whole RunConfig
#: minus the run-length and diagnostic fields, and the resume path
#: compares every field by name before it compares that hash -- so a
#: closure change refuses with the field named, not with a digest
#: mismatch.  ``km_opt`` and its constants (c_k, c_s, khdif, kvdif,
#: mix_isotropic, mix_full_fields, diff_opt, diff_6th_opt) are the worked
#: example: none is excluded from the fingerprint, none has a packaged
#: asset or a resolved callable, and giving the turbulence closure a table
#: here would add a SIXTH authority over the five registry rows that
#: already describe it -- the drift surface these tables exist to avoid --
#: while invalidating every v2 checkpoint on disk, since any added key
#: moves the physics-setup fingerprint.  The residual a row would close
#: (same selector, differently transcribed kernels) is the whole dycore's,
#: not km_opt's: no dycore option of any kind carries an identity string.
#: If that binding is ever wanted it is ONE dycore-wide identity beside
#: PHYSICS_DRIVER_ALGORITHM_IDENTITY, opened at a release boundary.

    THE CONCRETE BREAKAGE (measured 2026-09-10 07:39Z, single-domain ERA5
    forecast, mp_physics=9): every scheme a checkpoint names is looked up
    in one of the tables above, and a scheme with no row raises
    :class:`RestartManifestError` from ``_scheme_algorithm``.  That lookup
    happens inside ``write_restart``, which happens at the FIRST restart
    interval -- so a configuration the loader accepts and the forecast
    integrates dies at its first checkpoint, taking the 59 minutes of
    forecast it had already produced with it.  Nothing before that point
    can tell the operator, because nothing before that point asks the
    question.  This asks it while the answer is still free.

    Called from :func:`woof.config.validate_run_config`, which every door
    runs before any device work, so it needs no flag and no opt-in: a run
    that would not have been checkpointable is refused where a
    configuration error belongs, and a run that is checkpointable never
    sees it.

    ``ValueError``, deliberately, and not the ``RestartManifestError``
    the writer's own lookup raises: this is a CONFIGURATION refusal, and
    every door already renders a ValueError from the invariant battery as
    a user-facing refusal with exit code 2 (woof/cli.py) rather than a
    traceback.  The manifest error stays exactly where it was, as the
    backstop for a state that reaches a write unnameable.
