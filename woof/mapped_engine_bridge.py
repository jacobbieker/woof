"""Seam constants, frameset codec and launcher for the Rust mapped engine.

This module is the Python half of the ``gpuwm_mapped_engine`` seam.  The
normative contract text is ``docs/dev/decode-vendor-design.md`` and the
Rust half is ``tools/rw_wps/crates/mapped-engine/src/main.rs``; all three
spell ONE contract and the parity battery
(``tests/test_mapped_engine_parity.py``) holds them to it.

What lives here, and why each piece is on the Python side of the ruling
(Python orchestrates, Rust decodes):

* the resolution ladder and the ABI-marker handshake -- install-state
  knowledge the engine cannot have about itself;
* the ``gpuwm-mapped-frameset-v1`` codec: :func:`write_frameset` is what
  the PYTHON engine emits so its output is comparable to the Rust
  engine's byte for byte, and :func:`read_frameset` is what both routes
  read back.  One codec, two writers, one reader -- a divergence between
  the engines shows up as a hash mismatch rather than as two readers
  that disagree quietly;
* :func:`run_engine`, which launches the exe, drains its progress
  stream, and turns a refusal object into the exception type the Python
  engine raises for that same condition today.

Engine selection is :func:`resolve_engine`.  The Python engine stays
reachable through ``GPUWM_MAPPED_ENGINE=python`` / ``--mapped-engine
python`` and is documented AS A WORKAROUND (fixed means default).

#: decodes its bytes in the Rust engine, and the Python engine below is
#: reachable only through the documented workaround spelling.  Setting
#: this back to :data:`ENGINE_PYTHON` means writing a blocker into
#: :data:`DEFAULT_ENGINE_BLOCKER` that names the concrete breakage;
#: ``tests/test_mapped_engine_parity.py`` fails if the two disagree.
DEFAULT_ENGINE = ENGINE_RUST

#: Why :data:`DEFAULT_ENGINE` is not ``rust``; ``None`` while it is.
DEFAULT_ENGINE_BLOCKER = None

#: What the Rust engine implements, by mapped source format, per
#: subcommand.  ``None`` means every format.
#:
#: This is NOT an optimisation and NOT a fallback: the engine refuses
#: the entries missing below with class ``not_implemented`` in its own
#: words, so without this table a bare run of a composed source -- which
#: is how most staged sources reach a complete canonical frame -- would
#: refuse where it used to decode, and ArWen's refusal law is that a
#: refusal has to name breakage it PREVENTS.  An unported path prevents
#: nothing; it is unfinished work, and unfinished work does not get to
#: break a route that already ships.
#:
#: So the default engine is Rust and the still-unported paths are named
#: HERE, in one table, checked against the real binary by
#: ``test_the_capability_table_matches_the_built_engine`` -- which reads
#: the artifact's own declaration rather than trusting this comment.
#: Every mapped call records which engine actually ran, so nothing about
#: the split is silent.  NO entry is outstanding: every subcommand
#: declares every source format this repo reads.
#:
#: ``compose`` was the last one out, and it left on the evidence the
#: other two left on -- real staged bytes, measured against the Python
#: engine of record.  All eleven registered ``mapped_composition_v1``
#: sources with staged bytes reproduce their compose golden through the
#: built binary, byte for byte: the frames, the alignment receipt (all
#: three terrain clock rules) and the per-binding contributing-source
#: records (both cross-source borrows), plus the one source whose
#: staged ladder makes it refuse, refusing with the same sentence.
#: ``tests/test_mapped_engine_parity.py``'s
#: ``test_the_rust_engine_reproduces_the_compose_golden`` is that gate,
#: and it runs through ``decode_composed_source`` -- the real front
#: door -- rather than by driving the exe by hand.
#:
#: Per format, precisely, because the eleven measured rows are all
#: GRIB2 and that is the whole registry of packaged composed profiles:
#:
#:   * ``grib2`` -- eleven registered sources measured byte for byte,
#:     plus the front-door dual run in
#:     ``tools/mapped_engine_parity_sweep.py``'s compose arm.
#:   * ``netcdf`` -- no composed NetCDF source has staged bytes on any
#:     box that has run this (``20crv3-cf`` is the written-down
#:     exemption in the registry-coverage test), so it has no compose
#:     GOLDEN.  It is declared anyway, and not as a guess: NetCDF has no
#:     subprocess decoder tool, so an undeclared ``compose`` beside a
#:     declared ``decode`` makes the two capability questions name
#:     DIFFERENT decoder inventories and ``_verify_manifest`` refuses a
#:     correct preparation.  That asymmetry is measured by
#:     ``test_the_two_questions_name_one_decoder_inventory``.  What the
#:     declaration rests on otherwise is that the composition layer is
#:     format-independent -- it joins DECODED collections, and the
#:     per-format work under it is ``decode``, which NetCDF passes on
#:     its own golden and on the whole Python NetCDF suite.
#:   * ``grib1`` -- no packaged composed GRIB1 profile exists, so it is
#:     reachable only through the generic ``--source mapped`` door and
#:     has no golden for the same reason.  Declared to keep the two
#:     entries equal, which is the shape the manifest seal wants;
#:     leaving it out would make a generic GRIB1 composed prep depend on
#:     the door forwarding ``grib1_bridge`` to keep the answers in step.
#:
#: Every decode format this repo reads now decodes in process.  The two
#: that left this list before ``compose`` left it on real-bytes
#: evidence too:
#:
#:   * GRIB1 left when ``mapped-engine``'s ``grib1`` module landed: the
#:     ERA5 1974 reference object decodes to the Python engine's own
#:     forty-two array digests, grid fingerprint and materialization
#:     refusal through the built binary
#:     (``tests/test_mapped_engine_parity.py``'s ``era5-1974-grib1``
#:     row), so a bare GRIB1 run no longer needs the Python route.
#:   * NetCDF left once BOTH causes of its hold-back were named and
#:     fixed: ``tools/rw_wps`` was linking the stock crates.io
#:     ``hdf5-reader`` rather than the hardened vendored copy, and
#:     NetCDF-4 coordinate variables are HDF5 dimension scales that
#:     netcrust's variable index omits.  The whole Python NetCDF test
#:     set passes under ``GPUWM_MAPPED_ENGINE=rust`` on the same
#:     fixtures the Python engine passes, which is the evidence that
#:     declaration rests on -- not the single crate golden that was
#:     green throughout.
#: ``inventory`` is the raw per-record product-identity surface -- the
#: engine's answer to the question ``grib2_inventory`` used to be
#: resolved for on the 20CRv3 member route.  Declared for GRIB2 alone
#: because it renders GRIB2 section octets and decodes nothing; the
#: subprocess tool it replaces read the same edition and nothing else.

#: The subcommand ``woof.mapped_direct`` -- the module every mapped
#: preparation runs, packaged profiles and the generic route alike --
#: actually asks the engine for.
#:
#: It is ``compose`` on EVERY call, contributing mappings or not:
#: ``prepare_mapped_wrf`` runs ``woof.mapped_composition``'s byte work
#: (terrain composition, bound fields, subset indices) to reach a
#: canonical frame, and that is the ``compose`` entry above.
#:
#: Named here, beside the table it indexes, because the front door and
#: the route have to ask ONE question.  They did not: ``source_cli``
#: asked which engine was the DEFAULT and concluded "Rust, so no
#: subprocess tools are wanted", while the route asked the table for
#: ``compose`` and got the Python engine -- so the door composed a
#: command with the Python engine's work to do and none of the Python
#: engine's tools, and a bare prep of any composed source died inside
#: the decoder contract.  Declaring ``compose`` was the ONE edit the
#: port needed in this module; every consulting site followed.
MAPPED_ROUTE_SUBCOMMAND = "compose"

#: The unported paths, spelled for humans (docs, doctor, receipts).
#:
#: EMPTY, and kept as a tuple so the next unported door is DECLARED
#: rather than excused: ``woof doctor`` and the CLI reference read this
#: table, and ``test_a_door_that_forwards_decoder_tools_is_a_named_gap``
#: holds it in both directions over the whole registry -- a door that
#: forwards a decoder tool with no entry here fails, and an entry with
#: no forwarding door fails with it.
#:
#: The last entry out was the 20CRv3 member route (``woof prep --source
#: 20crv3``), and it left carrying both of the gates that held it back
#: rather than dropping them:
#:
#:   * ENSEMBLE IDENTITY.  The 20CRv3 PDT carries no member, so the
#:     verified filename member is now an EXPLICIT binding in the
#:     composition input manifest (``member``/``member_identity``), and
#:     ``compose`` -- both engines -- stamps it onto every canonical
#:     frame and into the sealed alignment receipt.  Held on the private
#:     member bytes by ``tests/test_twentycrv3_direct.py::``
#:     ``test_the_member_survives_the_generic_compose_route``.
#:   * PRODUCT IDENTITY.  ``twentycrv3_direct._verify_archive_inventory``
#:     keeps its exact every-member GRIB2 product contract and its own
#:     refusal wording; its measurement instrument on the bare default
#:     is the engine's raw record-inventory surface (the ``inventory``
#:     subcommand, :func:`engine_record_inventory`), with the subprocess
#:     ``grib2_inventory`` still answering on the documented
#:     Python-engine workaround.

    the middle of that block: pasting it runs ``gpuwm_mapped_engine`` as
    a command that does not exist, and the reader gets a shell error on
    top of the gap they were already looking at.  Both spellings exist
    because the two callers are different: an exception is read, a
    doctor remedy is pasted.

    Install-aware through the one mechanism every bundled artifact
    shares, :func:`woof.bridges.artifact_remedy`: in a CHECKOUT the
    crate is present and the cargo build is a real one-liner; on a WHEEL
    the prebuilt bundle this release published leads, and the
    clone-and-build route follows it commented out, because that route
    is the only one on a platform with no published bundle.  The engine
    is named to :func:`woof.bridges.prebuilt_bundle_offer` rather than
    merely asking whether a bundle exists, so the download is offered
    only when the pinned bundle actually carries it.

    It did not always compose that way, and the reason is exactly what
    changed.  ``gpuwm_mapped_engine`` was in no bundle roster, so this
    function printed a comment-only block on a wheel: leading with
    ``woof fetch-bridges`` would have sent a reader to a command that
    could not supply what they were missing, which is the ``rw_mrms``
    failure :func:`woof.bridges.prebuilt_bundle_offer` records.  The
    measured cost of that state was the whole DEFAULT decode path -- a
    fresh wheel install reported ``MISSING mapped decode engine ...
    blocks every mapped source`` and no woof command could close it,
    leaving a clone and a cargo build as a wheel user's only route.  The
    engine is now in :data:`woof.bridge_assets.BUNDLED_ARTIFACTS`,
    which is what makes the shared helper the truthful answer here.

    The documented workaround is named as a workaround, after both
    routes, on either install.

    bytes (3 km CONUS, 45 pressure levels, one 300x300 target), a bare
    default prep peaked at 35.2 GiB for two valid times and 67.0 GiB for
    four -- 15.9 GiB per additional time, of which the frames read whole
    are the largest single term -- so the seven-time preparation the
    source's own forecast cadence asks for needed ~114 GiB and died on
    every box smaller than that.  Nothing downstream ever needs two
    valid times at once: the initialize loop takes them one at a time
    and keeps only the perimeter frames.

    So this reads the DOCUMENT once -- schema, stream length, the
    scalars and per-field digests of every frame -- and reads a frame's
    arrays only when that frame is asked for, keeping the most recent
    one so a caller that touches the same index twice does not pay
    twice.  What a frame costs is unchanged, and so are its bytes: the
    arrays are the same little-endian float64 values the memory-mapped
    read produced, verified against the same per-field digests.

    The regular-snapshot join can instead request ``fieldwise_frame``.
    It uses the same metadata constructor and field checks while the owning
    snapshot copies one field at a time. This avoids a whole decoded frame
    alongside its packed copy; the stream representation is unchanged.

    What moves is WHEN a corrupt array is caught.  It is caught when its
    frame is read rather than before the first frame is built.  No
    number from an unverified frame reaches a preparation either way --
    a mapped preparation publishes its output tree atomically at the end
    -- and every frame the route consumes is verified, because the route
    consumes them all.
