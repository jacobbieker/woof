"""The open-file budget a preparation needs, asked for before it starts.

A GFS preparation holds one descriptor per decoded array for the whole
of the bundle write, and the array count is
``forcing times x fields per time``.  That is linear in forecast length,
so on a box with the ordinary 1024 soft ``RLIMIT_NOFILE`` there is a
forecast length past which no GFS run can be preprocessed at all.
Measured on the shipped 1.4.1 build (RTX 4080, Ubuntu 24.04, soft limit
1024, hard limit 1048576), a 120 h series -- 41 forcing times, 984
arrays -- peaked at **1023** descriptors and died:

    rw-wps --source gfs: [Errno 24] Too many open files:
      '/.../gpuwm-gfs-bridge-32m6ic0i/decoded/f000'

The same command with the soft limit raised to the hard limit completed
at rc 0 and wrote its proof.  Nothing else differed.

Two things are wrong there and this module fixes the second:

1. Holding 984 descriptors at once is retention nobody needs -- the
   arrays are written and never reopened.  Closing them as they are
   written is the better fix and belongs to the bundle writer; it is
   NOT done here, because that path is hash-bound and this one is not.
2. The soft limit was never raised, though the hard limit was a
   thousand times larger and raising it needs no privileges.  A process
   that knows how many descriptors its work needs should ask for them,
   and if it cannot have them it should say so BEFORE spending the
   decode rather than discovering it partway through -- as an
   ``[Errno 24]`` from whichever unlucky call happened to be next,
   which is how this arrived: the message above names a path the run
   had already read successfully.

The ceiling is real either way.  This module removes it wherever the
hard limit allows, and where it does not, converts a mid-run EMFILE
into a sentence naming the number and the command that grants it.
