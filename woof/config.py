#: impossible one: it is WRF's own ``diff_opt = 0``, and it is the
#: control the SASE attribution needs.  SASE is admitted at ``km_opt =
#: 0`` because its closure supplies the horizontal mixing the operator
#: would otherwise apply.  That admission, on its own, made the
#: single-variable control UNWRITABLE -- every SASE run necessarily
#: changed the PBL scheme AND removed the Smagorinsky operator, so no
#: run could say which of the two a difference came from.  Holding the
#: PBL scheme fixed and removing only the mixing is the missing cell.
#:
#: THIS IS NOT A GATE WIDENED TO PASS A TEST.  The gate's job is to stop
#: an unwitting misconfiguration, and it still does: the default still
#: refuses, the refusal still names the missing producer, and nothing
#: passes by accident.  What changed is that a user who states in
#: writing that the absent operator is the point can now write the run.
#: The id is a literal string rather than a boolean precisely so it
#: cannot be reached by a stray ``= true`` or an inherited default.
KM_OPT_ZERO_ACK = "no-horizontal-mixing-operator-v1"

#:
#: This is WRF's own table.  ``share/module_check_a_mundo.F`` subroutine
#: ``set_physics_rconfigs`` (:3546-3577) *resolves* ``num_soil_layers`` from
#: ``sf_surface_physics(1)`` -- it overwrites whatever the namelist asked for
#: -- and calls ``wrf_error_fatal`` on a scheme it has no entry for.  woof
#: follows that shape in :func:`soil_layer_count`, with one deliberate
#: difference recorded there.
#:
#: No count is written here.  Each value is READ from the module that owns the
#: scheme, so RUC's shipped nine is stated once, next to the level-depth
#: tables the kernel selects between -- ``__constant__ real
#: ruc_soil_layer_depth[RUC_NZS]``, whose ``#if RUC_NZS == 9`` /
#: ``#elif == 6`` arms are the two ``init_soil_depth_3`` tabulates.  (It read
#: ``[9]``, singular, while the forecast column was pinned to nine; that pin
#: is gone -- see docs/wrf_ruc_runtime_admission.md.)
#:
#: * Noah (2) and Noah-MP (4) share ``init_soil_depth_2``
#:   (``share/module_soil_pre.F:795`` and ``:807``, which is itself fatal at
#:   any other count), so both read
#:   :data:`woof.core.noah.NUM_SOIL_LAYERS`.
#: * RUC (3) is the only multi-geometry scheme.  ``init_soil_depth_3``
#:   (:1153-1194) tabulates zs for 6 and for 9 and is fatal at 4 or 5;
#:   :data:`woof.core.ruc_contract.WRF_SUPPORTED_NUM_SOIL_LAYERS` is that
#:   pair, in WRF's order.  Which of the two woof has actually validated is
#:   a separate question, answered by :func:`validated_soil_layer_count` and
#:   deliberately NOT encoded as this tuple's order -- the schema states what
#:   the scheme defines, not what woof has finished.
#:
#: DIVERGENCE, deliberate: WRF gives NOLSMSCHEME five layers
#: (``module_check_a_mundo.F:3547-3548``, a slab-scheme inheritance).  woof's
#: ``sf_surface_physics=0`` allocates no soil state at all, so the number is
#: only the length of a wrfout axis no field is written on; it is held at
#: Noah's so the frozen idealized-case wrfout headers (hill2d, igw, straka,
#: wk82, moist_bubble) keep byte identity.  Moving it would change five gated
#: files to describe an axis that stays empty.

#: The dataset precondition for an EXTERNALLY FORCED mp=28 domain, asked of
#: every source.
#:
#: WHERE IT FIRES, and why not everywhere.  This is a question about the
#: MACHINE -- is a 225 MB dataset installed here -- not about the
#: configuration, so it is not part of ``validate_run_config``'s battery.
#: A battery that answers it refuses a NAMELIST IMPORT, which emits a TOML
#: and runs no forecast, for a file the import does not read and cannot be
#: handed: ``import_namelists`` has no ``mp28_aerosol_source`` parameter, so
#: the one way out that needs no download was unreachable at the door the
#: refusal fired at, and the user never got the TOML they would have set it
#: in.  It is measured by :func:`mp28_aerosol_lateral_forcing_precondition`
#: and raised by :func:`validate_experiment_preparation` at the doors that
#: commit to building a forecast, before either of them fetches a byte
#: (``woof go``'s stage composer, ``woof run``'s experiment dispatch),
#: with :func:`validate_run_preparation` kept as the floor inside
#: ``woof.ingest.real.initialize_real``; the registry reports it at plan
#: review from its own row, and the option panel reports it against the
#: draft.  Every one of those doors can carry the ways out below.
#:
#: What was here before was a per-route table: ``woof/hrrr_route_inputs.py``
#: subtracted 28 from the one route spelled "hrrr" and no other route was
#: checked at all.  It was wrong in both directions.  It refused hrrr runs
#: that HAD the dataset -- correct runs -- because the premise it named ("no
#: aerosol boundary species on this stream") stopped being true when
#: ``woof/ingest/wif_climatology.py`` landed and nwfa/nifa joined
#: ``lateral_bc.COUPLED_SCALAR_STATE_FIELDS``; WRF does not take aerosol
#: from the driving model either, it reads the same monthly dataset through
#: ``constants_name``.  And it let every other specified-BC route --
#: era5_direct, gfs_direct, mapped_direct, a bare ``woof run`` -- walk into
#: the real defect with no refusal.
#:
#: The real condition is DATASET-conditioned and source-independent: with no
#: climatology the aerosol falls back to thompson_init's synthetic profile,
#: ``aerosol_from_input`` is False, and nwfa/nifa revert to flow-dependent
#: boundaries with zero inflow -- the measured depletion in
#: docs/public/PHYSICS.md, a front at 1.00454 of the wind, the whole domain's
#: initial aerosol gone after L/U.  A domain with no EXTERNAL inflow face
#: is not exposed to it, which is why the check is on ``specified`` rather
#: than on mp=28 alone.
#:
#: THE MEASUREMENT IS HERE AND NOT IN THE SENTENCE.  The front reaches
#: 1.00454 of the wind speed, so a 100 km nest in a 20 m/s flow has lost its
#: initial aerosol in 83 minutes and nothing NaNs, trips a bound or reports it
#: (docs/public/validation/mp28-column-evidence.md).  A reader at a door
#: needs the breakage and the way out; the numbers are why the refusal
#: exists, which is a question the source answers.
#:
#: AND WHY ``nested`` IS NOT PART OF THE CONDITION.  A child does not take
#: zero-inflow boundaries for these two fields: ``nwfa`` and ``nifa`` are
#: members of ``lateral_bc.COUPLED_SCALAR_STATE_FIELDS``, so a nest edge
#: carries them from the parent with the generic scalar coupling, whatever
#: the parent's aerosol source was.  The depletion is carried by
#: ``_external_scalar_boundary_fields`` (``lateral_bc.py``), the
#: specified-BC inventory, and an idealized tree -- a periodic root with
#: children and no ``specified`` anywhere -- has no external face at all.
#: Refusing it named a breakage that path does not have, which is the half
#: of the gate law that says a refusal must name a breakage it PREVENTS.

# woof.core.rrtmgp._MP_CLOUD_OPTICS_SCHEME had no row for 50 and the run
# died at its first radiation call.  That row now exists -- ``50: "p3"``,
# transcribed from WRF's own P3 coupling: has_reqc=1, has_reqi=1,
# has_reqs=0 (phys/module_physics_init.F:1022-1024 then :1033 in v4.7.1,
# :1021-1023 then :1032 in v4.6.1), cal_cldfra1's P3 arm
# (module_radiation_driver.F:3879-3887) and the wrappers' P3 species remap
# (module_ra_rrtmg_lw.F:12250-12261, module_ra_rrtmg_sw.F:10851-10863).
#
# The refusal's OTHER half was worse than the thing it refused: it named
# ra_rrtmg_variant='rrtmg_legacy' as a way through, and that arm raised
# too -- woof.core.rrtmg_legacy._MP_DECLARES_RADII had no row for 50
# either, so the advised remedy also died at the first radiation call,
# after the prepare.  Both arms are wired now (the legacy adapter asks
# has_reqs separately, which is what its wrapper's P3 branch has always
# needed), so there is no pairing left to refuse and no remedy left to
# name.  A guard that outlives its defect refuses working configurations,

    is ``CASE (MYJPBLSCHEME) / if(isfc .ne. 2) CALL wrf_error_fatal
    ('module_physics_init: use myjsfc scheme for this pbl option')``, and
    of the surface layers woof ports only ``MYJSFCSCHEME`` sets
    ``isfc = 2`` (:3169).  So the MYJ PBL with anything else is a WRF
    fatal, and this is that fatal.

    THE REVERSE DIRECTION IS ARWEN'S, and it is stated as such.  WRF
    admits the Eta surface layer under several PBLs it also ports (the
    ``isfc .ne. 2`` guards at :3742 and :3756 belong to other schemes);
    woof ports NONE of those, so the only PBL that could consume the Eta
    surface layer's output here is MYJ.  What makes the mismatch a
    refusal rather than a warning is one missing PAIR, named exactly:
    ``FM``/``FH``.  Those are the full similarity denominators
    ln(z/z0)-psi that WRF's PBL driver binds as ``PSIM``/``PSIH``
    (module_pbl_driver.F:1228); only the MM5 surface layers fill them
    (``SFCLAY_OUTPUTS``, woof/core/physics_inventory.py) and
    module_sf_myjsfc.F computes them nowhere.  YSU and Shin-Hong bind
    ``fm``/``fh`` directly and reconstruct ``zol = br*fm^2/fh``, so under
    the Eta layer they would divide by an allocated zero -- finite,
    plausible, and wrong.  The message names that pair and nothing else:
    the seven-field list this refusal used to print was partly FALSE
    (``rmol`` is in ``MYJ_SFCLAY_OUTPUTS`` and ``wspd`` is filled in the
    Eta layer's own post-call block), and a reason a reader can refute is
    how a correct refusal gets deleted.

    The PBL-OFF cell is refused separately and for its own reason: with
    the slot off nothing reads fm/fh at all, but the Eta layer's own PBLH
    scan reads the carried ``TKE_MYJ`` column, which is allocated for the
    MYJ PBL selector alone.

    Urban is refused by ABSENCE, deliberately: WRF sends the MYJ PBL
    through ``myjurb`` when ``sf_urban_physics`` is 2 or 3 (BEP/BEM,
    module_physics_init.F:3775-3781, phys/module_bl_myjurb.F).  woof has

    ``forced`` says the configuration WROTE ``mix_isotropic = 0`` -- as
    opposed to inheriting it -- and appends the override state to the
    over-the-limit sentence.  Since the auto-switch (project ruling, 2026-08-16;
    :func:`auto_mix_isotropic_selection`), a domain that reaches this
    advisory over the limit through the experiment loader can ONLY have
    written the value: an unset ``mix_isotropic`` resolves to 1 there
    and never lands here.  The caller supplies the flag because only it
    knows which loader the config came through.

    One wording, every door.  :func:`warn_anisotropic_w_mixing` prints
    it at config load; ``woof check`` repeats it in its advisory list
    (``woof.core.preflight.anisotropic_w_mixing_advisories``), because
    the load-time line scrolls past hours before the run that pays for
    it and the preflight report is where a reader is actually looking.

    The advisory is ``None`` when the configuration is not on the
    exposed path, or is on it and under the limit.  The ratio comes back
    either way, so a caller can record the number whether or not there
    was anything to say.

    A NON-FINITE ``dz_max`` ON AN OTHERWISE-EXPOSED DOMAIN GETS ITS OWN
    ADVISORY, and the ratio stays ``None``.  This is the third outcome,
    added 2026-08-09: the domain selected the per-axis mixing length, but
    its layer depths could not be resolved, so the criterion has a
    subject and no number.  Before this branch existed the ``None`` from
    :func:`anisotropic_w_mixing_ratio` collapsed that case back into "not
    applicable" and every door went quiet -- the same silence-reads-as-a-
    pass hole the resolved-ladder work had just closed one layer up.  No
    number is invented: the sentence says the depth is unresolvable, why
    (``ladder`` carries the provenance), and what to declare instead.

    The sentence is TIERED, because the criterion has two thresholds and
    they mean different things: above
    :data:`EXPLICIT_HORIZONTAL_DIFFUSION_LIMIT` the 2-grid-interval mode
    inverts each step and still decays; above
    :data:`EXPLICIT_HORIZONTAL_DIFFUSION_GROWTH_LIMIT` it grows.  A
    reader who sees one number against one limit cannot tell 0.3 from
    4.2, and 4.2 is the tier that aborted a run.

    ``ladder`` is a provenance clause for ``dz_max``, appended verbatim
    when non-empty (``woof.experiment.ExposedMixing.ladder`` supplies
    it).  A depth the caller RESOLVED for a config that wrote no eta
    interfaces must not read the same as one the config declared, and
    the number is otherwise indistinguishable.

    A warning and not a refusal, RE-RULED 2026-08-09 after the shipped
    configs were cleaned: the ratio is the WORST case the cap admits and
    the criterion overestimates what a flow reaches.  The receipt-backed
    leg of that is the 250 m nested tree, which completed five
    multi-hour runs at 0.702 -- 2.8x the limit -- with no sign of the
    failure mode.  Beside it sits one weaker observation, recorded in
    prose rather than in an instrument: the attempt #2b post-mortem
    notes 1.55 at the failing cell where the criterion read 4.23
    (``configs/les_tornado_100m_mayfield_20211210_attempt3.toml:232``,
    the only place that number is written down).  Refusing at load would
    also make the frozen records under ``configs/`` unloadable, which is
    the same as deleting the ability to reproduce a committed crash.

    What it is not is a taste bound -- above the limit the operator's
    own stability is no longer guaranteed by anything, and the failure
    mode is grid-scale vertical velocity that grows out of a field which
    should be being smoothed.  So it stays advisory, it says the number
    and the tier, and ``tests/test_shipped_configs_mixing_stability.py``
    keeps the shipped set out of the exposed state entirely.

    THE DEFAULT IS THE AUTO-SWITCH (project ruling, 2026-08-16; supersedes the
    recipe-only half of the 2.5.0 "where the default moved" ruling).
    "Fixed means default" makes an opt-in remedy for a correctness
    criterion a workaround, and an advisory that a bare config scrolls
    past was exactly that.  A domain that leaves ``mix_isotropic`` unset
    (or writes ``"auto"``) and violates this criterion now RUNS
    ``mix_isotropic = 1`` -- resolved by the experiment loader
    (``woof.experiment.resolve_auto_mix_isotropic``), announced by
    :func:`auto_mix_isotropic_selection` at load and by ``woof check``,
    with the fingerprint consequence named at both restart doors
    (:data:`MIX_ISOTROPIC_RESTART_BREAK_NOTICE`).  The wizard's
    :func:`woof.domain_wizard.gray_zone_advisory` recipe keeps naming
    ``mix_isotropic = 1`` explicitly, as before.

    So this function fires only for a configuration that WROTE
    ``mix_isotropic = 0`` (or one on a route the auto-switch does not
    resolve, e.g. a wrapped legacy RunConfig), and that asymmetry is the
    ruling: an explicit setting is kept, in the danger zone too, and
    what it gets is this warning -- the instability by name, the
    measured ratio, and (``forced``) the override state.  Refusing would
    make the frozen crash records unloadable; flipping a WRITTEN key
    would mutate a physics selector the user chose and orphan its
    checkpoints (``mix_isotropic`` is inside ``configuration_sha256``).

    Returns the computed ratio so a caller can record the number whether
    or not it warned.  ``None`` covers two cases and a caller must not
    conflate them: not applicable, and applicable with an unresolvable
    layer depth -- the second one warns, and the warning is the only
    place that distinction is visible from here.

    # PLAN REVIEW, LAST: every scheme this configuration selects must be

    # defect, where an accepted mp_physics=9 forecast integrated for 59
    # minutes and then died writing its first hourly checkpoint.

    # woof.io.restart, where the tables were born and where every reader
    # still spells them.  Plan review runs in every distribution this
    # module ships in, and the standalone RW-WPS preprocessing project
    # stages woof/*.py with only a named handful of woof/io -- restart.py
    # deliberately not among them, because it reaches the CUDA side.  An
    # import of woof.io.restart here is therefore unresolvable there, and
    # would raise ModuleNotFoundError out of the one call every front door
    # makes, on configurations it should simply have accepted.  Still
    # imported inside the function rather than at module scope, because
