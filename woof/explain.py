"""One layering convention for everything the CLI prints.

Every message this project prints earned its words.  The refusals name
what they refused and why the rail exists; the remedies are pasteable
whole; the receipts say what was verified against what.  None of that is
being cut.  What changed is that all of it used to print at once, so the
one line a reader needed -- the next command -- arrived in the middle of
a wall and was read as part of the wall.  A field exhibit: a wizard run
whose correct ``woof fetch`` line sat at line 15 of 20, under a
gray-zone advisory and above a nine-name dataset inventory, and whose
user's verdict was "still can't get it working".

So the words are layered rather than shortened:

* **default** -- what happened, and the single next action.  One line
  per item wherever items repeat.
* **``--explain``** -- the same output with the mechanism prose, the
  alternate routes, and the per-item evidence restored *verbatim*.

The convention is one flag with one name on every subcommand
(:func:`add_explain_flag` puts it on all of them, so the pointer this
module appends is never a lie), and one composition helper
(:func:`layered`) for messages that carry both halves.

Why a text sentinel rather than a structured exception.  The refusals
travel as ``ValueError``/``NotImplementedError`` through call chains
this package does not own, and are asserted on by tests that read
``str(error)``.  :func:`layered` keeps both halves inside that one
string, so every existing content assertion still holds and only the
*print boundary* -- :func:`render` -- decides which half reaches the
terminal.  Nothing is deleted; a layer is chosen.
