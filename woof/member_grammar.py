"""The ensemble member-addressing grammar: ``rw-wps.members.v1``.

An ensemble source enters woof the same way every source does -- as
table data.  This module is the one consumer of the ``rw-wps.members.v1``
document: a packaged JSON authority that declares, per ensemble, the
member set (classes, ordinals, id/token templates), the per-member
filename pattern for each published product, the byte-level verification
contract for each member class, and the statistic namespace (mean/spread
names) that shares the members' directory.

The contract the grammar exists to enforce, measured across four real
ensembles that disagree four incompatible ways about their own counts:

* members are FETCHED by filename, because that is how every
  file-per-member feed is published;
* members are VERIFIED at decode on the GRIB ensemble identity --
  (productDefinitionTemplateNumber, typeOfEnsembleForecast,
  perturbationNumber) -- because filenames are a distribution
  convention, not a format one, and because ensemble means and spreads
  share the members' namespace and decode cleanly as ordinary fields;
* verification FAILS CLOSED: a mismatch between what the filename claims
  and what the bytes carry is a refusal naming both, never a warning.

Nothing in this module knows any model's name.  What GEFS or AIGEFS
looks like -- an unflagged control, an ensemble-size octet that
excludes (or includes) the control, a member that is a path component
rather than a filename token -- is rows in the packaged documents, and
the next ensemble (ERA5-EDA, 20CRv3, AIFS-ENS members) is another
document, not another code path.

Verification itself lives in :mod:`woof.member_prep`, which reads the
real bytes through the Rust GRIB2 inventory; this module owns the
declarative half only.
