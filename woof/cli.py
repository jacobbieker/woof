"""woof command line for real-data workflows and verification cases.

``woof fetch`` acquires initialization/boundary data (GFS/HRRR
download with manifests, ERA5 cdsapi template + validation); the
behavior lives in :mod:`woof.fetch`.

``woof adapt`` compiles a WPS Vtable plus a declarative mapping descriptor,
then verifies the caller's actual GRIB2 inventory before creating a runnable,
explicitly non-stock-WRF-certified mapped adapter bundle.

``woof static|ingest|run CONFIG`` sniffs the TOML shape: an
``[experiment]``/``[[domain]]`` file routes to the Phase-5 experiment
path (schema + validation in :mod:`woof.experiment`, declared inputs in
:mod:`woof.case_data`, pipeline in :mod:`woof.runtime`), anything else
is a legacy :class:`RunConfig` dispatched to its registered real case.
``woof resume CONFIG`` is sugar over ``run --restart``: it locates the
newest valid ``gpuwmrst`` checkpoint set in ``--outdir``
(:mod:`woof.resume`) and continues through run's own dispatch, so the
restart machinery's identity refusals apply unchanged.  ``woof render
WRFOUT...`` renders product PNGs (:mod:`woof.render`); ``woof enprod
ENS_ROOT`` renders the ensemble suite -- mean, spread, exceedance
probability, paintball, probability-matched mean -- over a manifest-
declared ensemble of member run directories (:mod:`woof.da.enprod`).
``woof report [RUNDIR]`` collects one anonymous diagnostic bundle --
receipts, the failure, stage logs, this install's provenance, the card,
free space -- into a readable zip a reporter can open before they send
it (:mod:`woof.report_bundle`).
``woof update`` prints -- and only prints -- the upgrade command for
the distribution that provides THIS install and the interpreter running
it, plus the staged asset directories a wheel replacement leaves alone
(:mod:`woof.update_cli`).
``woof run-plan PLAN.json`` is the same run for a PROGRAM rather than
a person: one versioned plan document in (an envelope over the config
system, not a second config format), one append-only JSONL event stream
out -- to ``<run_dir>/events.jsonl`` and to stdout -- in which every
fact the human output prints is a typed field on a typed event, so a
GUI or a scheduler driving woof as a subprocess never parses prose.
``--resolve``/``--estimate``/``--probe`` answer the three questions a
front end asks before it starts anything (:mod:`woof.runplan`).
``woof import-namelist WPS INPUT`` translates WRF namelists into a
resolved experiment TOML and prints the substitution report.  ``woof
verify CASE`` runs either an idealized benchmark or a real case, prints
its metrics dict, and exits 0 when every gate passes or 1 naming the
failing metric.  Gate intervals are single-sourced: each case module
exports ``GATES`` and both this driver and the benchmark tests consume
that one export.

No case is named here.  The case tables below are views over
:mod:`woof.verify.cases`, which discovers case modules and classifies
them by the entry points they declare, so a case joins ``woof verify``
and ``woof static|ingest|run`` by existing -- this driver needs no edit.
``woof cases`` prints that registry (``--json`` for a front end).
