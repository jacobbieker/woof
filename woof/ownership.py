"""One live owner for a shared file or folder.

Several writers in this package used to assume they were alone: the run
event stream, the downscale output folder and the bridge download.  Two
processes aimed at the same path then interleaved or deleted each
other's bytes.  This module is the one exclusive claim they all take.

A claim is an owner file created with ``O_CREAT | O_EXCL``.  It records
the owning process (pid, the process creation time and, on Linux, the
boot id), the host, what the claim is for and a random token.  A second
claimant that finds a live owner waits or refuses; one that finds an
owner whose process is gone, or whose pid now names a different process,
takes the claim over.  Release and every cleanup that depends on the
claim check the token first, so a writer never removes something another
owner now holds.
