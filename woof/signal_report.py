"""What a run says on its way out when something else decides to stop it.

A three-domain ERA5 forecast was reported as printing this, in full::

    $ woof run configs/run60.toml --outdir out/run60
    woof run: woof 2.6.0 -- installed wheel at .../site-packages/gpuwm
    Terminated

One word, from the shell, not from woof.  ``Terminated`` is bash reporting
that its foreground job died on SIGTERM, and the package installed no
handler anywhere (``grep -rn "signal.signal(" gpuwm/`` was empty), so the
signal hit both woof processes at their default disposition: instant
death, no ``finally``, nothing printed.  The user got one word because
woof had nothing to say -- and could not tell whether it was their
config, their card, their data, or a woof crash.

This module is the sentence.  It says four things, because those are the
four a reader cannot recover afterwards:

* WHICH PHASE the run had reached, read from the run's own
  ``run-progress.json`` -- ``preparing:build-domain-tree`` is the forcing
  decode, ``integrating`` is the forecast, and they point at different
  causes;
* HOW MUCH MEMORY was held at that instant, host first, because the
  common killer is host RAM and no woof preflight prices any;
* THAT THE SIGNAL CAME FROM OUTSIDE, with the usual senders named, so
  the reader looks at ``journalctl`` rather than at their config;
* WHERE THE REAL OUTPUT IS -- a supervised run is two processes and the
  worker's stderr is a file in ``--outdir``, which the terminal never
  sees.

Three properties this deliberately keeps.

**The exit status does not change.**  The handler reports, restores the
disposition it replaced, and re-delivers the signal to itself.  A run
killed by SIGTERM still dies of SIGTERM (shell status 143); a Ctrl-C
still reaches the ``KeyboardInterrupt`` contract in
:mod:`woof.cli` and still returns 130.  A handler that swallowed the
signal would be worse than no handler at all.

Delivery is CPython's, not this module's: the C handler sets a flag and
the Python handler runs at the next bytecode boundary, so a worker deep
in a long C call reports when that call returns -- the same latency a
``KeyboardInterrupt`` has always had there.  The supervisor's own
``_terminate_fresh_worker`` still escalates to SIGKILL after ten
seconds, so nothing waits longer for this than it did before.

**A masked signal stays masked.**  A shell that starts a job in the
background sets SIGINT to ``SIG_IGN`` for it (POSIX job control), and
:func:`woof.cli._warn_if_interrupt_is_ignored` already declines to
fight that.  So does this: an ignored disposition is left exactly as the
shell set it and nothing is installed over it.

**Nothing here allocates that it can avoid.**  The killer is usually
memory, so the report is pre-rendered at install time and the handler
writes bytes with :func:`os.write` on file descriptor 2 -- not through
``print``, whose buffered ``TextIOWrapper`` the interrupted frame may
have been inside of.  It reads one small file, takes one ``pread`` on a
descriptor opened in advance, and calls no CUDA entry point at all.
