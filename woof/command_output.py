#: It lives HERE, beside the draining implementation, and not in the
#: front door that opens it, because a front door is also a program:
#: ``python -m woof.source_cli`` executes that file once as
#: ``__main__`` and a second time under its package name when a library
#: imports it, and the two copies then hold two registries.  The copy
#: that launches the preparation read its own empty one, fell back to an
#: inherited-handle launch, and the log the run had already advertised
#: on screen ("Details: ...") stayed zero bytes for the whole run, with
#: the child's refusal on the terminal instead of in the file the
#: message named.  A module nothing runs as a program has one copy, so
#: both copies of any door share this.
