"""Case-data configuration: the ``[case_data]`` TOML table (Phase 5, Task 2).

An experiment TOML describes the *simulation* (grids, clocks, physics --
:mod:`woof.experiment`); this module describes the *data* a real case
consumes and how its outputs are identified.  Every path, schema id, and
policy that used to be a hard-coded constant of the runtime path is a
declared key here: forcing GRIB paths/globs, the Vtable schema, the WPS
namelist used for grid construction (until config-driven Lambert grids
land in Task 5), the GEOG root, an optional declared source-orography
artifact (or the forcing catalog's ``era5_z_invariant`` provider), the
``sfcp_to_sfcp`` surface-pressure policy, the trace-gas choice, and the
output identity (domain id, title).

Validation is fail-loud: unknown keys, missing keys, wrong types,
missing files, and empty globs are hard errors at load.  One residual
advisory is deliberate, and it is not a key-schema decision: a
``co2_vmr`` above the sanity envelope is loaded exactly as written with
one warning line -- the value the run uses is the one written.  A blank
``output_title`` used to fall back to ``woof``, which substituted a
value into the wrfout ``TITLE`` attribute under a key the reader did
write; it refuses now, like every other wrong type here.

Paths resolve relative to the TOML file's directory; entries containing
glob characters expand (sorted) so a case may declare per-time forcing
files with one pattern.

Portable roots
--------------
Every declared path may reference an environment variable as
``${NAME}``, expanded before resolution.  Large case bundles (reference
wrfouts, WPS_GEOG, multi-gigabyte GRIB) live outside the repository and
their location differs per machine, so without this the only way to
declare them is an absolute developer path -- which is both unportable
and a machine path shipped in a source distribution.

One variable, :data:`CASE_DATA_ROOT_ENV`, carries a default
(:func:`default_case_data_root`) so the committed configs resolve
unchanged on a machine that sets nothing; every other name must be set
or the load fails naming the variable and the key.  Point the variable
somewhere else and the same config reads a bundle copied anywhere::

    GPUWM_CASE_DATA_ROOT=/data/bundles woof check configs/<case>.toml

The Task-3 preflight (``woof check``) later builds a hashed
:class:`InputCatalog` on top of these declarations; this module's
:class:`ResolvedInput` records are the minimal provenance surface the
Task-2 runtime prints and the catalog consumes.
