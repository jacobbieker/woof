"""Ensemble member preparation: fetch by filename, verify by bytes.

The generic half of the ensemble member capability.  The declarative
half -- which members exist, how their files are named, what their bytes
must say -- is the packaged ``rw-wps.members.v1`` document read by
:mod:`woof.member_grammar`.  This module does the work those documents
authorize and nothing else:

1. **Verification.**  Every message of a file claimed as member X is
   checked against X's declared ensemble identity: the product
   definition template, ``typeOfEnsembleForecast``, and
   ``perturbationNumber`` (the triple), plus the declared encoded
   ensemble size and generating-process pins where the grammar states
   them.  A mismatch refuses, naming what the filename claims AND what
   the bytes carry.  This fails closed because every failure mode here
   is silent: an ensemble mean decodes as a plausible member, a
   different member's trajectory decodes as the requested one, and no
   later stage can tell.

2. **Preparation.**  A verified member is staged into a member-addressed
   prepared tree -- ``<set>/<cycle>/<member>/<product>/<file>`` -- whose
   receipt pins the grammar document, the member identity, and the
   SHA-256 of every staged byte.  The tree exists because upstream leaf
   names cannot be trusted to carry identity: AIGEFS publishes
   byte-identical leaf filenames for all 31 members, so any flat store
   destroys the member axis.

The GRIB2 octets are read by the Rust ``grib2_inventory`` bridge; no
GRIB decoding happens in Python.  The inventory's ensemble-identity
columns (``ensemble_type``, ``ensemble_size``, ``derived_forecast``)
are REQUIRED: a stale bridge that predates them cannot tell a mean from
a member, so it refuses with a rebuild remedy rather than degrading.
