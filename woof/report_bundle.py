"""One command that turns "it broke" into a file somebody can read.

``woof report`` collects, from a run directory, the artifacts that
actually explain a failure -- the receipts, the failure capsule, the
worker stderr, the stage logs, the printed command chain if one was
recorded, this install's provenance, the runtime versions, the card, and
the free space on the volumes involved -- redacts every identity-shaped
string out of them, and writes a plain zip the reporter can open before
they send it.

Three properties are the whole point, and each exists because the
obvious implementation gets it wrong.

**It survives the failure it exists for.**  The defect this was written
against is out-of-space: the decoder routes every diagnostic through two
error-ignoring writes to the SAME filesystem that just failed, and the
consumer's unwind removes the staging directory holding the gate note,
so the reporter is left with ``RuntimeError: pipeline producer exited
1:`` -- an empty message, no log, no argv.  A collector that streams a
staging tree onto that same full volume, or that raises the first time
an artifact it expected is missing, is useless exactly there.  So the
archive is built in memory and written once, relocating to another
volume if the first write is refused; a missing artifact is a named line
in the manifest, never an exception; and when a volume is nearly full
the manifest says so next to the note that the empty producer message is
a KNOWN erasure rather than additional information.  Nothing here fixes
that defect -- that is a separate lane -- but nothing here pretends the
bundle is complete when it is not.

**It is anonymous, and says how.**  Usernames, home directories,
hostnames, IP and MAC addresses, e-mail addresses, credential-shaped
strings, and every environment variable outside an explicit allowlist
are replaced by class placeholders -- inside JSON receipts and log text
as well as in path names.  Redaction runs in two passes: the first
HARVESTS identity literals, including any account name found as a
home-directory path segment anywhere in the collected bytes, which is
how a foreign username planted in a config value teaches the redactor to
scrub the same name out of a log line where it appears bare.  The second
pass applies them.

**A chosen domain is science, not identity.**  Latitudes, longitudes,
dates, grid shapes, physics choices and file names are what the reporter
asked the model to compute; they are kept verbatim, and the manifest
says so, so nobody has to guess whether their study area was in the
file.

The routes do not all leave the same artifacts (the front door writes a
supervisor progress file and a failure capsule; the prepared runners
write ``report.json``; the tree runner writes ``evidence/``), so absence
is reported per artifact WITH the route that would have written it.  A
bundle that is thin because the run died in its first minute has to look
different from one that is thin because the collector gave up.
