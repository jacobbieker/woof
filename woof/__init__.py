"""The woof package.

``__version__`` is read from the installed distribution's metadata, not
declared here.  A hand-maintained constant is a promise to update two
files at every cut, and that promise was broken: the wheel shipped
``0.1.1`` for four releases, and 1.1.1's prepared-cache provenance
refusal used it to tell a 1.1.1 user "this is woof 0.1.1" -- a sentence
whose whole job is to name the release that is speaking.

The metadata read is the one belonging to the distribution that installed
THIS package, found by its own files (:func:`owning_distribution`), not
the first distribution of a matching name on the path.  Asked by name, a
staged ``rw-wps`` package, or any woof run beside a second woof
install (a venv and a ``--user`` install), read the other install's
number, and the rw-wps runtime check then refused it ("rw-wps version
mismatch").

The fallbacks cover what ownership cannot answer.  A tree no installed
distribution provides reads the first matching name on the path, as
before, which is what lets :mod:`woof.provenance` call that number
BORROWED and :mod:`woof.provenance_gate` refuse it when it disagrees
with the tree's own declaration.  With no distribution to ask at all it
says so rather than inventing a number.
