"""Read-only plot metadata for the terminal picker; no forecast defaults change.

This module owns two small tables and one question.

The tables are the curated plot PRESETS (``plot-presets.json``) and the
packaged record of what the wrfout history lane cannot draw and why
(``research-diagnostics.json``).  The question is the one a reader has
before a forecast rather than after it: *of the products I just chose,
which will this install actually draw?*

The record is deliberately NOT a second catalog.  The renderer owns the
product vocabulary and answers availability per store; the packaged JSON
carries only two things the renderer cannot state on its own -- the
REASON a product is unserved on this lane, written for a reader, and the
WINDOW a product needs before it means anything.  A row's absence from
it therefore says nothing at all, and nothing here refuses on absence.

    ONE source: the packaged record, which names the products the wrfout
    lane cannot serve AND the concrete reason, in the words a reader
    needs.

    The renderer's FILELESS requirement rows used to be folded in beside
    it and are not any more, for a measured reason.  That pair reads the
    build's requirement table and its wrfout import PLAN with no file
    open, and measured on the shipped wheel against a real child it
    called sixteen of the shipped ``snow`` preset's twenty-one products
    undrawable -- ``2m_temperature`` and ``500mb_height_winds`` among
    them -- on the very run that then drew 143 pictures of exactly those
    products.  A picker that tells a reader a product will not draw,
    about products every run draws, teaches that reader to skip the
    lines that are true.  The same reading retired the same pair at the
    ``woof downscale`` door; this was its last caller.

    The measurement that holds is the store's own catalog, asked about
    the frames one invocation is about to render
    (:func:`woof.render._available_window_request`), and that is where
    a product is dropped and named.

    This block STATES, never refuses.  A preset is a curated request,
    not a promise about one install, and narrowing the curated list to
    what this box happens to draw would hide the finding instead of
    reporting it.
