"""Whether a source's window can start, and which cycle ``latest`` is, as it posts.

A run that starts on its source's first hours and waits for the rest
(DESIGN A136, the as-posted chain) asks three questions of a host, and
every door asks them here so no two answers can disagree:

* :func:`lead_answer`: does one host hold every object of one lead?
  ``posted``, ``not_posted`` or ``not_heard``.  A host that could not be
  heard is never counted as not holding the lead.
* :func:`start_needs` and :func:`readiness`: which leads must be posted
  before the run can start (the analysis, the first boundary interval,
  the route's invariant and step-0 objects, a same-cycle donor, a whole
  cycle's final lead), and the ``gpuwm.readiness.v1`` answer a site
  launches on.
* :func:`resolve_startable_cycle`: ``latest`` under ``as_posted``, the
  newest cycle whose start needs are posted and whose ladder covers the
  window.

Nothing here names a source.  Which objects a lead is made of is the
route table's plan (or the legacy transport's own URL builder, the same
ones the completeness probe asks), when a lead is due is the source's
``publication_lag`` rows, and how a run waits is its ``posting`` block.
