"""ctypes seam onto the Rust observation remap (``obs-regrid``).

The library is ``tools/rustwx/crates/obs-regrid``, the port target for
:mod:`woof.verify.obs.regrid` -- both registered remap operators, the
bounded neighbour search that used to be ``scipy.spatial.cKDTree``, and
the validity remap that used to be ``numpy.add.at``.  WOOF's Python
boundary names "regrid/transform" as data-path processing, and this is
where that half of the observation battery runs now.

Why ctypes rather than pyo3: the same ruling as
:mod:`woof.io.nc_writer_bridge` and :mod:`woof.static.rust_bridge` --
every Rust library woof drives is a cdylib behind ctypes; one loading
discipline, one staging path, one ABI-marker rule, no per-interpreter
builds.

Why it lives HERE and not under ``woof/verify/obs`` beside the module
it serves.  ``woof doctor`` reports on this library by name, so
``woof/doctor.py`` imports this seam -- and doctor ships in the
standalone RW-WPS preprocessing wheel, which stages no verification
package at all.  Measured 2026-08-18: with this module inside
``woof/verify/obs``, ``tools/build_rw_wps_release.py`` refused to stage
the wheel outright, because its verification-boundary scan saw a staged
runtime module importing ``woof.verify.*``.  That boundary is absolute
rather than exemptible (see ``_OBS_EXCLUDES`` in the builder), and every
other cdylib seam in the tree already sits outside it --
:mod:`woof.netcdf_bridge`, :mod:`woof.mapped_engine_bridge`,
:mod:`woof.io.nc_writer_bridge`, :mod:`woof.static.rust_bridge`,
:mod:`woof.obs.dealias_region`.  This one was the lone exception, and
the exception is what broke the build.  The Python fallback and the
parity reference stay in :mod:`woof.verify.obs.regrid`; only the seam
moved.

Default-on contract (WOOF's fixed-means-default law): a bare
``python -m tools.obs_battery_score`` builds and applies its remap plans
here.  The pure-Python implementation stays importable as the parity
reference and as an explicit fallback (``WOOF_OBSREGRID_PYTHON=1``),
and every use of the fallback is a reported workaround, never silent.

**What the fallback announcement names**, because a refusal or a
degradation that does not name its breakage does not exist: on the
scipy path, two source cells exactly equidistant from one destination
cell are resolved by whichever the k-d tree traversal reached first.
Measured over 400 trials scipy answered the lowest flat index 232 times
and some other tied index 168 times (``golden/gen_regrid_goldens.py``,
probe ``ties``).  The battery's premise is that every arm of a case is
remapped by the identical integer array, so no score can differ because
a neighbour search broke a tie differently -- and a plan whose ties turn
on traversal order is exactly that defect, one scipy upgrade away.  The
Rust engine defines the answer instead: the lowest flat source index
wins.  A run that falls back is a run whose remap plan is no longer a
function of its two grids alone, and it says so.
