"""What this install can do, and the exact command that closes each gap.

ONE registry, consulted by every front door, so that "you need the GPU
runtime" is one sentence with one remedy wherever a reader meets it.

The rule this module exists to enforce, which this program has paid for
twice: **a command refuses BEFORE it does expensive work** -- before any
network fetch, large disk write, or GPU allocation -- **with a named
refusal that states what is missing and the exact command that fixes
it.**  The shape is :mod:`woof.obs.dealias`'s front-door refusal, which
names its install line before decode and gridding rather than an hour
into a run.

Three properties are essential, and each has a test:

* **The remedy is DERIVED from what is actually missing**, never keyed
  on the exception's class name.  ``woof run-plan`` used to answer
  every ``ModuleNotFoundError`` with the CuPy remedy, so a missing
  ``scipy`` inside a plan run told the caller to install a GPU wheel.
  Here the missing MODULE selects the remedy, and a module this registry
  does not know gets no remedy at all -- absence is accurate, a wrong
  remedy is not.
* **Every remedy names something that EXISTS.**  Every extra spelled in
  this file is checked against the distribution's own metadata, and
  every ``woof`` command spelled here is checked against the parser.
  ``woof render --pair`` used to send a reader to ``recast-woof[render]`` for
  Pillow, which that extra does not contain.
* **The probe says what it PROVED.**  Presence is answered with
  :func:`importlib.util.find_spec`, which resolves the module without
  importing it: no CuPy import, no CUDA context, nothing claimed about
  whether the runtime then works.  "Installed" and "working" are two
  claims and only ``woof doctor`` makes the second one; a front door
  that conflated them would either refuse a working box or bless a
  broken one.
