"""Repository-root conftest: arm the pre-commit line-ending hook.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.  ``tools/git_hooks/pre_commit_line_endings.py``
refuses a commit that would give an authored file a carriage return, and
it stopped nothing at all, because arming it meant reading an
``--install`` flag documented only inside its own docstring and nothing
in the repository ran it.  Measured on 2026-08-29: ``.git/hooks/pre-commit``
did not exist in this clone, no ``core.hooksPath`` was set, no
``.pre-commit-config.yaml``, and the two incidents the hook was written
for were both committed straight through it --
``tests/test_offline_child.py`` rewritten to CRLF across all 673 lines
with a real 79-line addition buried inside the whole-file diff (repaired
by 39ef138c5), and
``tools/rustwx/crates/rw-mpas/src/bin/fp32_floor_probe.rs`` born with 525
carriage returns (repaired by abb5ff270).

"Fixed means default" is a project law, so the hook arms itself.  pytest
is the arming point because it is the one command every lane in this
repository runs, and a conftest at the ROOT is loaded for any test under
it -- so a fresh clone is armed by its first test run, with nobody
remembering anything.

It is deliberately quiet on success and it does NOT make itself true:
``tests/test_line_ending_stability.py::test_the_pre_commit_hook_is_armed``
asks the filesystem separately and fails if this did not take.  A hook
that is quietly not there is the exact defect being fixed, so failing to
arm has to be visible rather than absent.

    Asked FIRST and answered in silence, because an unpacked sdist
    carries this file and `tools/git_hooks/` with it -- setuptools' sdist
    default file set sweeps every .py under the project root -- and there
    is no repository there to have a pre-commit hook.  Warning in that
    case would put a RuntimeWarning on every `pytest` run of an installed
    source distribution and say nothing true.

    The toplevel comparison is the ownership check: an sdist unpacked
    INSIDE some other project's git repository still answers "yes" to
    ``rev-parse``, and arming there would write a pre-commit hook into a
    git directory we do not own.  Only when the working tree's root IS
    the directory holding this conftest is the hooks directory ours.  A
    linked woof worktree passes (its root carries this file) and arms
    the shared hooks path, which is the intended one-per-clone shape.
