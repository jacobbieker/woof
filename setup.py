"""Platform tagging for the wheel, decided by what the wheel CARRIES.

Everything about this distribution is declared in ``pyproject.toml``.
This file exists for one thing setuptools cannot express declaratively:
a wheel that ships prebuilt Rust artifacts is not installable on every
platform, and must not claim to be.

The rule is mechanical, and it reads the tree rather than a flag:

* ``woof/libexec/bridges`` is absent -> the wheel is pure Python and is
  tagged ``py3-none-any``, exactly as every release through 2.3.3 was.
  This is still published, and it is what pip resolves on a platform no
  bundle exists for (macOS, aarch64).  On it, every Rust door refuses BY
  NAME with a build-from-source remedy; nothing degrades into Python.
* ``woof/libexec/bridges`` is present -> the wheel carries native code
  for exactly one platform and is tagged ``py3-none-<platform>``
  (``py3-none-win_amd64``, ``py3-none-manylinux_2_28_x86_64``).  The
  platform comes from the staged ``BUNDLE.json``, never from the machine
  running the build, so a cross-staged bundle cannot be mis-tagged as
  the builder's own platform.

The ABI tag stays ``none`` and the Python tag stays ``py3`` on purpose.
The artifacts are executables and cdylibs launched or ``ctypes``-loaded
by path -- they are not CPython extension modules, they link no libpython
and they see no ``Py_`` symbol.  Letting bdist_wheel derive a
``cp313-cp313`` tag from ``has_ext_modules`` would multiply the release
matrix by every supported Python minor to describe a coupling that does
not exist.

``tools/stage_wheel_bridges.py`` is what creates that directory; see its
docstring for what is staged and what deliberately is not.
