# The init front door: `woof hex init`

Build MPAS initial conditions without the native Fortran `init_atmosphere_model`.
The numerics are the Rust engine `rw_mpas_init` (woof `tools/rustwx/crates/rw-mpas`,
case-7 port); this door finds the engine, refuses bad inputs by name before an
engine run, and writes a provenance receipt beside the init file.

## Invocation (native-free, the normal mode)

Since the native-free bootstrap merged (136e31c), a normal invocation needs no
native MPAS file at all: the vertical contract is constructed from
`--grid + --static + --vertical-spec` (see
`native-free-init-admission.md`), written to a durable artifact, and handed to
the engine through its existing capsule ABI.

```sh
export RW_MPAS_INIT=/path/to/rw_mpas_init        # or pass --engine

python -m woof.hex.cli init \
  --met    WORK/MET:2025-03-14_12 \              # WPS intermediate file, or a dir holding exactly one
  --static assets/MESH.static.nc \
  --grid   assets/MESH.grid.nc \                 # REQUIRED in native-free mode
  --vertical-spec verification/vertical-specs/tc55-v1.json \
  --out    init.nc \
  --start-time 2025-03-14_12:00:00 \
  --nfglevels 38 --nfgsoillevels 4 \
  --extrap-airtemp lapse-rate --use-spechumd no \
  --theta-adv-order 3 --coef-3rd-order 0.25 \
  --virtual-factor reproduce-fortran --deep-soil-moisture reproduce-fortran \
  --landuse-table MODIFIED_IGBP_MODIS_NOAH \
  --frac-seaice yes --tsk-seaice-threshold 100.0 \
  --oned-underflow preserve
```

The constructed artifact (default `<out>.vertical.nc`, own receipt beside it)
is a complete init-class capsule: the static's mesh/statics carriers, the
constructed vertical contract (float32, the native ABI), the met-state
landing sites the engine writes its values into, and the derived mesh
geometry (`edgeNormalVectors`, `localVerticalUnitVectors`,
`cellTangentPlane`, `coeffs_reconstruct`) that native MPAS fills during
initialization and static files carry as zeros.  `--theta-adv-order` and
`--coef-3rd-order` must agree with the vertical spec's declaration.

## Invocation (compatibility mode, native capsule)

A native init-class file is opened only when BOTH `--capsule` and
`--reference` are passed; mixing them with `--vertical-spec` refuses by name.

```sh
python -m woof.hex.cli init \
  --met    WORK/MET:2025-03-14_12 \
  --static assets/MESH.static.nc \
  --grid   assets/MESH.grid.nc \                 # optional here; cross-checked against --static
  --capsule   NATIVE_INIT.nc \                   # vertical metrics + smoothed terrain source
  --reference NATIVE_INIT.nc \                   # zgrid asserted bit-identical against this
  --out    init.nc \
  --start-time 2025-03-14_12:00:00 \
  --nfglevels 38 --nfgsoillevels 4 \
  --extrap-airtemp lapse-rate --use-spechumd no \
  --theta-adv-order 3 --coef-3rd-order 0.25 \
  --virtual-factor reproduce-fortran --deep-soil-moisture reproduce-fortran \
  --landuse-table MODIFIED_IGBP_MODIS_NOAH \
  --frac-seaice yes --tsk-seaice-threshold 100.0 \
  --oned-underflow preserve
```

On success: `init.nc`, plus `init.nc.provenance.json` (sha256 of every input,
the engine binary, the argv, the engine's own receipt, and the output), and a
JSON summary on stdout.  Exit 0.

Every physics switch is **required and has no default**, mirroring the engine:
each one changes the numbers in a file that opens cleanly and reads plausibly
either way.  The native namelist key is printed in each refusal so a captured
`namelist.init_atmosphere` transcribes without guessing (`--nfglevels` =
`config_nfglevels`, `--extrap-airtemp` = `config_extrap_airtemp`,
`--landuse-table` = `config_landuse_data`, …).  `--virtual-factor`,
`--deep-soil-moisture` and `--oned-underflow` are properties of the reference
*build*, not namelist keys; `reproduce-fortran` / `reproduce-fortran` /
`preserve` is the defined-behaviour set, and `--oned-underflow
reproduce-ifx-ftz` reproduces an `-O3` ifx reference exactly where the two
modes diverge.

## What the capsule is

`rw_mpas_init` does not build the vertical grid.  It reads `zgrid, zz, fzm,
fzp, dzu, rdzw, zb, zb3` and the smoothed terrain from an init-class capsule
and asserts the capsule's `zgrid` bit-identical against `--reference` before
trusting a single level.  In native-free mode the constructed artifact IS the
capsule and is passed as both inputs, which keeps that identity check; in
compatibility mode the capsule is a **native-minted init-class file**.  The
produced init is drop-in only for a consumer pinning the same grid/static
bytes the capsule was built from; the forecast driver refuses otherwise (it
reports changed reconstruction-coefficient bytes: that message means
provenance mismatch, not corruption).

## Refusals (exit 2, each names the breakage and the remedy)

- a physics switch not given (no default; names the namelist key)
- `--met/--static/--capsule/--reference/--out` not given
- no engine configured / engine path missing / not executable
- output directory does not exist (refused before the engine runs)
- met source missing; directory with zero or several WPS intermediates
- file not readable as a WPS intermediate (truncated / non-ungrib bytes)
- `LANDSEA` absent from the intermediate file
- no level tagged `200100.0` (the surface tag)
- more distinct first-guess levels than `--nfglevels` declares
- no soil layers (`ST*/SM*/SOILT*/SOILM*`) in the intermediate file
- `--start-time` not among the met file's valid times
- static file missing engine-read dimensions/variables
- `--grid` vs `--static` nCells mismatch (two different meshes)
- capsule missing the vertical-contract variables, or built for another mesh
- reference without `zgrid`, or `zgrid` shape differing from the capsule's

Engine-side refusals (rc 1) pass through verbatim; the door adds one line
naming that the engine refused and that nothing was written.

## Proof of record

Golden parity and the acid test are recorded in the provenance receipts of the
first door run: the door-built init for the ERA5 2025-03-14 12Z factory case
was compared field-by-field against the surviving native golden under
`init-tolerances-r3.json`, and the same file started the CUDA v8.4.1 port for a
5-composite-step forecast smoke, rc 0.
