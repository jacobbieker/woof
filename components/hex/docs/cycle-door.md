# `woof hex cycle`: following weather from one cycle to the next

Everything this project had built was a snapshot. Detection, placement,
culling, a full-physics limited-area forecast and a composite render all
worked once, from one coarse run, at one hour. The plan layer already knew how
to decide whether a slot MOVES or STAYS between cycles (continuation radius,
promotion margin, dwell, regeneration thresholds) and there was nothing to
hand that decision to.

This door is the loop those parts were built for.

## The two legs

```
woof hex cycle plan   # what every cycle would place, and what a delayed
                       # start would save.  Nothing is cut, no device opened.

woof hex cycle run    # do it: cull, mid-window init, boundaries, contract
                       # deck, full-physics fine forecast, frame, next cycle
```

## One cycle, in order

| leg | what it does | typical cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| plan | detect in the coarse forecast, place swaths, hysteresis decides move or stay | under a second |
| cull (grid) | cut the fine grid out of the parent | 1–3 s |
| **resolution check** | is this swath inside the parent's refinement? | free |
| cull (static, init) | the rest of the limited-area case | 1–3 s |
| delayed start | the parent's state at the hour the swath wanted | seconds |
| boundaries | `rw_mpas_lbc` over the coarse parent's own frames | 3–5 s |
| contract deck | the 22 regional kernels against the CPU authority, on THESE rings | ~2 min |
| fine forecast | full physics, through the shipped forecast door | ~6 min per 6 h |
| render | weather fields through `rw_mpas_convert` + `rw_wrfbatch` | minutes |

## Three things the loop refuses, by name

**A swath outside the parent's refinement.** A parent mesh is refined over the
region *some* placement asked for. A later cycle can rank a swath somewhere
else entirely, and a cull taken there is a limited-area domain made of the
parent's BACKGROUND cells. Nothing about that fails loudly: it binds, it
admits, and it integrates 71 km cells at a 20 s timestep, producing a full set
of frames nobody could tell from a real forecast without reading `dcEdge`. The
loop cuts the grid first, measures `min(dcEdge)`, and moves to the next
candidate. An operational cascade answers this by regenerating the parent for
the new placement; a cascade holding one parent has to skip and say so.

**A late swath with no parent stream.** A swath that wants to start after its
parent's init hour needs the parent's state at that hour. Without
`--parent-history` the only initial condition available is the parent's init,
and covering the window would mean integrating the fine grid through hours
nobody placed a grid for. The refusal happens before anything is cut.

**A cull with no contract deck.** The 22 regional kernels are indexed by ring,
so a deck run on another cull's rings measured another cull's zones. The loop
runs the deck and presents its receipt; a cull whose deck did not pass never
reaches a forecast.

## The delayed start

A swath placed for weather that arrives at hour 12 should start at hour 12.
Before this door the only initial condition a cull could have was its parent's
INIT, so covering that threat meant integrating the fine grid from hour 0 and
throwing the first twelve hours away.

The parent's own history stream cannot be an initial condition on its own:
measured, it publishes no `xtime`, no `zgrid`/`zz`, no base state and no
connectivity. But everything it lacks is TIME-INVARIANT and is in the parent's
init. So a mid-window state is **the culled init with its prognostic state
replaced by the parent's state at the hour the swath wanted**, gathered onto
the child's cells by exact coordinate bits: a cull moves no cell centre, so a
child cell's `latCell`/`lonCell` are the parent's float64 bits unchanged, and
**a miss is a refusal, never a nearest neighbour**.

**What it does not carry**, reported per field on every composition:

- the ice-phase hydrometeors (`qi`, `qs`, `qg`): the parent publishes them and
  the init stream has no slot, so a grid started inside an ice cloud re-forms
  it and the first hour is a spin-up;
- land-surface memory the history stream does not publish (snow water
  equivalent, snow depth, snow cover, sea ice, SST) which stays at the
  parent's own init hour. Soil temperature, soil moisture and skin temperature
  ARE carried;
- turbulent kinetic energy, for the same reason.

**An init's clock lives in three places** and all three move together: the
`xtime` variable, `initial_time`, and the `config_start_time` global attribute
the forecast door asserts `--start-time` against.

## Registering a cull nobody wrote a row for

`woof hex forecast` resolves `--mesh` against the registry and refuses a name
it does not hold. That is right about a mesh somebody downloaded and
unanswerable for a mesh the cascade cut four seconds ago.
`woof.hex.cascade_row` writes the row from the cull receipt that made it, and
the registry re-hashes both files at bind regardless, so a row that lies about
its bytes refuses exactly as a hand-written one would. Lineage stops at a row a
person registered: a cull of an unregistered parent is refused by name.

What a cascade row does not have is a person who read it. What stands in for
that is the per-geometry contract deck, which is a stronger statement about the
rings than a reader is.

## No phenomenon appears on this door

There is no `--tropical-cyclone`, no per-threat mode and no branch on
`threat_class` anywhere in the package. A tropical cyclone, a convective area,
a fire-weather region and an atmospheric river are ROWS in
`threat-metrics.v3`; they reach the loop as admitted entries carrying a cull
region, a mesh spec, an ignition hour and a pad, and the loop cannot tell them
apart. `tests/test_cycle_cascade.py` asserts that as a property of the
executable source: identifiers, argument names and live strings, docstrings
excluded.
