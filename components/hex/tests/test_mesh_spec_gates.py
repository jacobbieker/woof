"""A spec the BUILD refuses must be refused by SIZING first.

THE DEFECT THESE PIN, MEASURED 2026-08-28 on the current engine.
``rw_mpas_mesh --dry-run`` sizes a resolution spec, prints a receipt and
exits 0 without applying the gates its own build applies.  Two designs were
reported lost to that, and both reproduce here:

* a 0.75/6/75 km design sized clean and the build refused it in 87 ms on the
  transition-band gate -- pure arithmetic on the same gradient the dry-run
  receipt had just printed;
* a 0.75/3/15/75 km design sized clean, cleared that gate, spent 1,251 s
  relaxing and deriving 217,621 cells, and was refused on the 200 m
  shortest-dual-edge floor at edge 562175 (36.8 m over an 886 m dcEdge) with
  no grid written.  The report that opened this lane read 711 s and 39.2 m
  for the same shape on another box.

The first is decidable from the spec and is now refused by sizing.  The
second is not decidable from a spec, and the fix for it is that sizing SAYS
so, with the quantities that decide it, instead of being silent.
