"""Timestep admission: the opened pin stays a gate, and the clocks agree.

Two things are under test here and they are different defects.

**The freeze.**  ``V841MpasColumnPhysicsConfig.validate`` refused any
``config_dt`` but 120.0 with a literal, alongside ``config_bldt_seconds``
and ``config_cudt_seconds``.  Its premise was "unproven at other dt", not
"wrong at other dt", so it is now the earned-anchor registry
:mod:`woof.hex.dt_admission` -- one anchored timestep today, every other
value refused BY NAME with the evidence an anchor needs and the procedure
that mints it.  The admitted set is unchanged; what changed is that a ruling
now has a table to edit instead of a literal.

**The rebinding gap, which was its own defect.**  MEASURED (2026-08-26,
the proving RTX 5090): ``bind_mesh`` rebound ``DT_SECONDS`` in the proof and
forecast modules and the GWDO guards, and the sealed Arwen constructor read
that rebound value -- but the DYCORE takes its outer step from
``config.config_dt``, which the config built from its dataclass default.  A
mesh row declaring 100 s bound clean, allocated 18,820 MiB, spent 285 s and
died inside composite step 0 with ``post-RK candidate time must equal the
exact step endpoint: 120.0 != 100.0``.  The two clocks now come from one
source.

Everything here runs on a CPU-only box.
