"""Cell-coordination admission, tested in BOTH directions on measured readings.

An admission gate that only ever passes is not an instrument.  Each test here
either proves a mesh that forecasts is admitted, or proves the mesh that is
known to die is refused BY NAME with the numbers a reader can act on.

The readings are measured, read from the registered grid files themselves on
the proving RTX 5090 (RTX 5090, 2026-08-26, ``evidence/graded-blowup-20260826/``):

    v20.80.151649  {5: 1029, 6: 149603, 7: 1017}          completed 6 h
    v16.66.195630  {4: 1, 5: 1028, 6: 193584, 7: 1016, 8: 1}
                                                          died at step 23/36

Both meshes come from the same generator, the same campaign and the same init
pipeline.  ``v20.80.151649`` ran at 94.9% of its own Courant limit with the
WORSE dual-edge amplification of the two (24.34x against 24.03x), so neither
the timestep margin nor the TRiSK amplification separates them; the
coordination histogram does.
