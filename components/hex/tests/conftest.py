"""Tier gates for the woof hex test battery.

Three things in this tree cannot run everywhere, and each one used to fail in
a way that told the reader nothing:

* **CUDA tests** compiled and ran kernels on whatever card was present, even
  on a box whose owner had asked that no GPU work happen there.
* **The x4.163842 full-physics tier** needs the re-derived free-memory
  floor (about 20.5 GiB: the measured x4 peak plus headroom).  On a
  smaller card it does not print "this card is too small"; it dies inside a
  CuPy allocation with an out-of-memory traceback several frames below
  anything a reader recognises.
* **The byte-pinned authority tier** (mesh, static, init, native history)
  needs about 6.9 GiB of files that ship with no fetch path and live on
  the reference node.  Without them four tests raise ``FileNotFoundError`` naming
  a path inside this checkout that has never existed on this machine, which
  reads as a broken checkout rather than a missing asset.

So each tier gets a gate that names the concrete breakage, and each gate
fails closed.  The marker discipline is woof's, deliberately: a convention
that depends on every author remembering a decorator fails open, and woof
measured what that costs -- 34 CUDA gates once compiled and ran on a machine
that had been declared off limits, because an unmarked test is not excluded
by ``-m "not gpu"``.  Detection here is by AST, and an explicit marker is
additive rather than the only route in.

# it -- the ledger a footprint row was fitted from, the contract run an
# admission anchor was earned by.  Those receipts live under `evidence/`, and
# `evidence/` is deliberately HELD OUT of every published surface: it carries
# home-directory paths and node labels.  The assembled public tree drops it,
# and the sdist packs exactly one member of it.
#
# THE BREAKAGE THIS GATE PREVENTS, measured 2026-08-27 on two independent
# surfaces: 30 of these tests failed on an assembled public tree
# (evidence/assembly-rehearsal-20260827/) and about 28 in a fresh-venv run of
# the sdist a user unpacks (evidence/xmachine-20260827/).  `ci.yml` runs on
# push, so the first public act would have gone red on the release commit --
# every one of them raising FileNotFoundError on a path inside the checkout
# that never existed on the reader's machine, which reads as a broken
# distribution rather than a record that does not travel.
#
# THE DISCRIMINATOR IS THE DISTRIBUTION, NOT THE FILE, and that is the whole
# design.  "This tree does not carry its receipts" is a skip.  "This tree
# carries its receipts and the one this row names is not among them" is a
# FAILURE, and it is exactly the defect the anchor gates were written to
# catch: a row citing a measurement nobody can check.  A per-file existence
# test would collapse the two into one answer and retire a real gate while
# looking like it fixed a packaging problem.
