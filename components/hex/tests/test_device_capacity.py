"""The preflight for the big-card tier.

The x4.163842 full-physics proof is a forty-minute run whose measured peak
at the converged pin is 20,542 MiB; its admission floor is that requirement
plus headroom, read from the one admission surface.  On a smaller card it
does not refuse: it dies part-way through, inside a CuPy allocation, several
frames below anything the reader recognises, after burning whatever time it
took to get there.  This test is the cheap version of that discovery -- it
asks the question first, and on a card that cannot answer it skips with the
number rather than pretending the tier passed.
