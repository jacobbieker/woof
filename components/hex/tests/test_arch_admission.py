"""Architecture admission: open by default, with the anchors kept as record.

Every architecture NVRTC can compile the kernels for runs, with no flag, the
way any other model runs on the card it is given.  The per-architecture
anchors (the numerical contract measured again on real hardware of that
architecture) stay as the evidence record: a receipt says whether its card's
architecture holds one and names the pin, and never claims one it does not
hold.  The architecture refusals left each name a concrete breakage: a card
NVRTC cannot compile for, on which no kernel could be built, and, measured
by the forecast door on an unanchored card, ordinary arithmetic that is not
IEEE, on which every number the run produced would be wrong.  The sm_120
pin a few FTZ instruments still pass is held below with the recorded byte
pins that keep it there.  The sm_120 path is unchanged.

The evidence tests further down hold every registered anchor to the record
it rests on.

# THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS.  The only evidence test used to check that the
# receipt file and the authority directory EXIST.  A mutation run against the
# sm_89 receipts (2026-09-24 review) found 9 of 11 edits passing it: the
# authority digest file deleted or one of its digests changed, VERDICT.json
# flipped to refuse, the calibration file or the whole contract/ directory
# deleted, the calibration maximum raised above the ceiling, RECEIPT.md
# emptied, the card changed to another GPU, the determinism record set to
# not identical.  An entry resting on edited evidence would still admit its
# architecture.  These tests open the evidence: each registered row is pinned
# to one exact record (``evidence_sha256``), and in a tree that carries the
# receipts the record has to say what the row says: the card and compute
# capability, the FTZ route grid and the contraction pin, the contract decks,
# the authority digests and their twice-reproduced status, and the readings
# the guard-cost ceiling is set from.
#
# A second mutation run (2026-09-24, content tests only, the pin re-set to
# each mutated directory) found 16 of 18 further edits passing: a frame digest
# changed consistently in the three summary files while both runs still record
# the real hash; one run's own snapshot hash changed; one run's receipt
# replaced by a copy of the other's; one run recording 180 of 360 steps or
# another host; the P3 companion pair not identical; and, in the review-fix
# addendum, a regional contract, a transport deck, an engine FTZ receipt or a
# door preflight saying it failed, the addendum's 45-entrypoint audit losing
# the Smagorinsky record it exists to supply, a leg's rc disagreeing with the
# addendum's table, a raw calibration process file raised or deleted.  So the
# twice-reproduced claim is now read from each door run's own records (its
# driver receipt, its DOOR line, the chain's leg window), and every receipt
# outside attempts/ is held to its own verdict.
#
# A third mutation run (2026-09-24, same method) found 15 of 22 further edits
# passing, because a receipt's summary flags were read and the records under
# them were not.  A regional contract kept "8/8 decks bitwise" with one
# payload's device hash no longer its host hash, a pass-2 payload not
# bitwise, or a declared kernel dropped from every deck.  A guard-cost
# reading could record an enabled/disabled identity break.  The engine FTZ
# receipt's route grid and its filed artifacts were never read.  The record
# session's chain.log rcs, VERDICT.json's states and its record count were
# never reconciled.  An instrument could differ from its SHA256SUMS and from
# the runner hash its identity records, a forecast receipt's driver seal was
# never recomputed, and the nvidia-smi census was never parsed.  So every
# payload a regional contract carries is held to its hash, every identity
# claim in a timing receipt is held true, the engine receipt is held to its
# route grid and its artifacts, the verdict is reconciled with the chain and
# its own receipt, and the instruments, the driver seals and the census are
# checked against what recorded them.
