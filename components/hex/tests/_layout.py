"""Where this tree's package lives, in whichever layout the tests run in.

The tests run in this repository, where the package is ``src/hexcore``, and
in a tree that folds the package in under another import name, where the
package sits at that tree's root under its import name, two levels above
the component folder that holds these tests.  A test that opened
``src/hexcore/...`` by a fixed path failed or errored in the folded layout,
so every test that reads one of the package's own files finds the package
by its import name here instead.

Imported by name (``from _layout import PACKAGE_DIR``), not through
``conftest``: a folded tree has more than one ``conftest.py``.
