"""Every test file on disk is named by a tier list, and every tier row is real.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS
--------------------------
``tools/battery/cpu_files.txt`` opens by saying why it is a list of files and
not a bare ``tests/``::

    The list is files, not a bare "tests/", so that adding a test file is a
    deliberate act of deciding which tier it belongs to.  A new file that
    nobody added here is not silently absorbed into the tier that runs
    everywhere.

Nothing enforced that, and the opposite happened.  Measured in this tree at
``dd6183d``, with ``WOOF_HEX_NO_LOCAL_GPU=1`` and the tier-1 selector
``-m "not gpu and not bigcard and not assets"``::

    56 test files on disk
    16 named by a tier list          -> 238 tests, run by CI on every push
    40 named by no tier list at all  -> 629 tests (73%), run by NOTHING
    the 40, run together:  618 passed, 11 skipped, 5 deselected in 73.91 s

Not one of the forty was device-only, asset-only or slow.  They were simply
never added.  The evidence that this is a repeating fault rather than a single
oversight is already inside ``cpu_files.txt``: the comment above
``tests/test_obs_referee.py`` records that the obs referee "was in no tier list
at all until the referee's first real run, which meant the machinery that
decides whether the physics is right was not gated on any push".  That was one
file, found by hand, when somebody happened to run it.  There were forty more.

A test file on no tier list does not fail, does not skip and does not report.
It is not slow, not flaky and not deferred -- it simply never runs, and the
green check on the pull request is telling the truth about a smaller estate
than the reader thinks they are looking at.

WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS
----------------------
1. Every ``tests/test_*.py`` on disk is named by at least one tier list, so
   the forty-first cannot arrive quietly.
2. A file named by more than one tier is DECLARED, with the reason each tier
   takes it.  Two files earn that at dd6183d and are pinned; a third arriving
   silently doubles a leg's cost and is argued for by neither list.
3. Every path a tier list names exists, so a rename cannot leave a list
   pointing at nothing -- the same fault ``tests/test_source_manifests.py``
   already guards for the port's own source manifests, applied to the lists
   that decide what runs.
4. The tier lists are non-empty and parse, because a census over an empty
   list passes and protects nothing.

Cost: three file reads and one directory listing.  It imports nothing from
the port, needs no device, no assets and no network.
