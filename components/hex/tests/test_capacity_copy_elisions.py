"""Static gates for the bit-preserving capacity copy-elision patch.

These tests do not make a hardware or output-equivalence claim. They ensure the
specific read-only bindings, named refusal, and exact source-pin migration do
not silently disappear before the required CUDA A/B runs are performed.

    # Moved again 2026-08-26 by the convection ruling: the per-component
    # physics cadence table reports convection: None when no cumulus scheme
    # is selected.  The reciprocal-rewrite migration this table guards is
    # untouched -- the flux3/flux4 denominator is still the translation-unit
    # constant, checked by name in the tests below.
    # Moved again 2026-08-26 by the limited-area physics lane: the bdyMask
    # digest has one definition again and cuda_driver delegates to it, and
    # the full-physics commit's recovered-state gate is routed through the
    # regional runtime like every other recovered-state gate already was.
    # Moved again 2026-08-27 by the provenance scrub: three comment
    # and docstring lines naming a person and a machine were rewritten so the
    # public assembly no longer has to move bytes that sit under a pin.  The
    # elisions this table guards are untouched, which is checked by name in
    # the tests below rather than asserted.
    # Moved again 2026-08-28 by the 0.2.0 package rename: all three files are
    # byte-identical to their pre-rename selves once the token mpas_port is
    # substituted with hexcore, so no elision this table guards moved at all --
    # which the tests below check by name rather than assert.  Re-derived by
    # tools/repin_source_tables.py, never by hand.
