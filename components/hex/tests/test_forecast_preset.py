"""Forecast presets are rows, and a row resolves into knobs the door has.

``woof hex forecast --preset NAME`` selects a row of
:mod:`woof.hex.forecast_preset`.  The door turns the row into the surface/PBL
cadence at the bound mesh's timestep and hands that to the same admission
and the same driver argument an explicit ``--pbl-cadence`` takes, so a
preset is never a second code path.  THE BREAKAGES THESE TESTS HOLD SHUT:

* a preset holding the stack for a number of seconds that is not a whole
  number of the mesh's steps would be refused on every mesh whose dt does
  not divide it -- the row names a longest hold instead, and resolves to the
  largest whole number of steps inside it;
* a row declaring a radiation, land-surface, surface-layer or PBL scheme the
  pinned engine seam does not take as an argument would run the engine's
  suite under the row's name -- it is refused by name;
* an explicit ``--pbl-cadence`` is the user's own selection and must win.

Everything here runs on a CPU-only box.
