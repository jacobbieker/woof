"""No CUDA translation unit may divide by a float literal.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS, measured 2026-08-26 on the desktop RTX 3080
(sm_86, NVRTC 13.0.48 ``CL-36260728``, driver 13030) and recorded in
``tree/evidence/nvrtc-reciprocal-20260826/``:

NVRTC compiles ``x / <float literal>`` to a real ``div.rn.f32`` for every
target up to and including ``compute_90``, and to ``mul.rn.f32`` by the
literal's float32 reciprocal for every target from ``compute_100`` up --
which covers every card this port runs production work on.  The reciprocal of
12 is not exactly representable, so the multiply is not the correctly-rounded
quotient the CPU authority computes.  On the reference regional bytes that
moved:

===========================  =========  ==========================
kernel                       values     values the rewrite changes
===========================  =========  ==========================
``transport_vertical_flux``    166,376    51,258  (30.81 %)
``vertical_u_flux_f32``        474,032   157,710  (33.27 %)
``theta_vertical_flux_f32``    154,492    51,639  (33.43 %)
``w_vertical_flux_f32``        154,492    51,318  (33.22 %)
===========================  =========  ==========================

The 51,258 figure is the whole of a divergence that stood on the books
unexplained: ``transport_vertical_flux`` against the CPU authority's
``_atmosphere_vertical_flux`` on the reference cull.

The remedy is a divisor the compiler is not allowed to fold -- a
``__constant__`` translation-unit symbol or a runtime kernel argument, both of
which the host can write.  ``mpas_div`` must keep carrying the division so
its FTZ subnormal guard stays on the path; ``__fdiv_rn`` at a call site would
resist the rewrite but drop that guard.
