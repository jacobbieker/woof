#: Directory names this repository has retired, newest spelling last.
#:
#: AN ARCHIVED RECEIPT IS NEVER REWRITTEN, so a receipt names its sources in
#: the spelling the tree used on the day it ran, and a rename strands every one
#: of those names.  THE BREAKAGE THIS MAP PREVENTS, and it is not theoretical:
#: the four L5b regional receipts each name fourteen sources under
#: ``src/mpas_port/``, the 0.2.0 package rename retired that directory, and the
#: gate below stopped being a gate -- it died inside ``read_bytes`` with a
#: FileNotFoundError before it could compare a single digest, which reads as an
#: infrastructure fault rather than as "this anchor is resting on bytes nobody
#: can account for".
#:
#: This is a TRANSLATION of a retired name, never a relaxation.  A translated
#: name still has to resolve to a real file, and still has to match the
#: recorded digest or carry a declared drift entry; a name that lands nowhere
#: fails BY NAME, saying which spellings it tried, instead of raising an OS
#: error from three frames down.
