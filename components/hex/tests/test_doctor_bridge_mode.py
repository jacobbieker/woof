"""``doctor`` and the doors agree about a bridge that is present and not
executable.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS, measured on a pip install of 0.3.1: the engine
wheel's bridge binaries arrived mode 664, ``woof hex doctor`` reported
every one of them found, and the door refused the same file as not
executable.  ``engines.locate`` (what doctor reports through) now answers
the way ``engines.resolve`` (what the doors run through) does.
