"""The 2-GPU scheduler answers from the ONE admission surface.

The partition scheduler carried a second admission surface: a 22 GiB
whole-mesh constant scaled linearly through the origin with no fixed term
(the exact shape the 2026-08-25 L6 re-derivation retired), plus a separate
20 GiB ``min_free_bytes`` default.  The linear shape is UNDER-protective
for a partition: the fixed term of the measured row (4,339.1 MiB on the
170 SM card, CUDA context, local-memory backing store, module images) is
paid in full by every rank's process regardless of how few cells its
partition owns, so a floor with no fixed term admits a small partition on
a device that cannot even hold the process.  These tests pin the floors to
``woof.hex.device_admission`` so the scheduler cannot drift from the gate
every other free-memory decision applies.
