"""What the placement layer does when it meets THIS PROJECT'S forecast.

The swath layer was proven against a fixture whose fields are analytic and
whose file is one self-describing history with every frame on one ``Time``
axis.  A forecast from ``woof hex forecast`` is not that file.  It is one
file per frame, each with ``Time`` of 1, carrying ``latCell`` and
``lonCell`` but no ``areaCell``, no ``cellsOnCell``, no ``nEdgesOnCell``
and no ``xtime`` -- and the shipped reader refused it by name.

Two defects are pinned here, both found by pointing the door at real
output and neither reachable from the fixture:

1. THE REACH DEFECT.  A capability that cannot read its own project's
   forecast has no front door.  The fix is not to add variables to the
   history stream -- those frames' digests are pinned by the execution
   anchors -- but to read the run receipt written beside them, which
   already names the sequence, the times and the grid.

2. THE FIELD DEFECT.  ``low_pressure_centre`` searched RAW surface
   pressure for a minimum.  On a real 96 km global forecast that returns
   the Tibetan Plateau, not a cyclone: elevation beats every weather
   feature on Earth by about 45 kPa.  No threshold VALUE repairs that,
   because the ordering itself is wrong.  The field had to become a
   sea-level reduction.

The shapes below are a test double of the real artifact, and the real
artifact is what they were built from: see
``evidence/swath-first-real-20260826/`` for the same door driven against a
24 h u96.64002 global run on the proving RTX 5070 Ti.

    Measured on a real 151,649-cell global forecast: taking areas off the
    GRID file gave every cell about 8.3e-11 km^2, so the convection row's
    20,000 km^2 floor rejected all 266 connected 35 dBZ regions at every
    frame -- and reported nothing wrong.  A wrong answer with no error is
    worse than a refusal, so this is now a refusal.
