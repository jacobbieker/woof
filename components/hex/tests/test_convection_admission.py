"""Convection admission: the scheme is OFF below 3 km, by default.

It was ruled on 2026-08-26 that convection is switched off below 3 km,
answering directly whether a fine swath runs the cumulus scheme at all.
This is that ruling, made executable.

**Why it is a gate and not a preference.**  THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS,
MEASURED (2026-08-26, `evidence/dt-anchors-20260826/RECEIPT.md`): WRF pins
``cudt = 0`` for ``cu_physics = 3``, so Grell-Freitas recomputes every
model step and no configuration relaxes it.  A 5 s timestep therefore calls
the closure 720 times an hour against the 30 the lane was proven at, and the
5 s anchor measured a |w| mean climbing 12.0 / 49.6 / 73.5 / 87.5 m/s over
four half-hour windows against a 120 s control's 1.15 / 1.17 / 1.20 / 1.48,
with |w| max 102.67 against 1.680.  A 3 km swath declares 20 s and a 750 m
swath declares 5 s, so every mesh the ruling covers runs the closure at
between six and twenty-four times its proven call rate.

**Fixed means default.**  A bare run on a sub-3-km mesh must stop calling
the scheme with nobody passing a flag; the explicit ``--convection`` switch
exists to run A/B arms (that is how the attribution above was measured),
never as the remedy.

**Convection-off is a NEW admitted configuration, not a mutation of the
proven one.**  The frozen v8.4.1 column-physics lane's proven configuration
stays exactly reachable and exactly refusing: how often a scheme is called
is part of what an anchor certifies, so a convection-off run earns its own
anchors and cannot borrow the GF rows'.

Everything here runs on a CPU-only box.
