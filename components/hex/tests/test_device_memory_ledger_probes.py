"""The per-allocation ledger instruments' self-validation controls are pinned to live premises.

Stale-guard audit, finding 6: reservation_probe's positive control was
pinned to ``gf_gfdrv_stage`` at 7,034.0 MiB -- the pre-cut in-run sum.  The
Grell-Freitas frame cut shrank that frame to 88/72 B, so the instrument
declared its own technique invalid (``CONTROLS FAIL``, exit 1) against a
retired premise, and the sibling image probe never resolved the module that
now holds the widest launched frame.  These tests pin both instruments to
the post-cut premise (``wsm6_column``, 7,216 B -- STATE.md section 5) so the
next frame move fails HERE, by name, instead of inside a GPU session.
