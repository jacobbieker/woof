"""The forecast door: argument grammar, refusals, admission, receipt shape.

Everything here runs on a CPU-only box.  The door's device contact is
confined to three functions -- :func:`measure_device_memory`,
:func:`read_device_compute` and :func:`read_card_profile` -- so that the
DECISION they feed can be tested at every interesting free-memory value
without owning a card at that value, which is the only way to test the
refusal that fires on a card too small for the request.  All three are
substituted for every test in this file by the autouse fixtures below.

THE BREAKAGE THE THIRD ONE PREVENTS, measured on both CI matrix legs and
reproduced on the Windows desktop (``evidence/xmachine-20260827/`` §4):
``read_card_profile`` is a SECOND point of device contact that arrived after
this file was written, and it refuses outright when ``WOOF_HEX_NO_LOCAL_GPU``
is set.  ``ci.yml``'s tier-1 step sets exactly that variable, so this
distribution's own CI environment made this distribution's own door refuse,
and ``test_the_door_leaves_destination_creation_to_the_driver`` -- a test
about directory creation, with no interest in any card -- went red on the
release commit.  The refusal itself is correct and stays: a box that has
declared no GPU work cannot run a forecast.  What was wrong is a test file
claiming its device contact was confined to one function when it was not.
