"""Writers that land on a TRACKED file write LF, whatever the platform.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS, and why the blobs cannot show it.
``.gitattributes`` here declares ``* text=auto eol=lf``, so git NORMALIZES
every text file on the way into the object database.  That is the right
setting -- ``tests/test_checkout_reproducibility.py`` records what it cost
to learn it -- but it has one consequence that is easy to miss: a CRLF
write to a tracked file leaves the blob perfectly clean while the WORKING
TREE keeps the carriage returns.  Nothing that reads the object database
can see it, and ``git status`` stays clean because git normalizes before
it compares.

Measured in this checkout on 2026-08-29: twelve tracked non-binary files
carry 1,261 CR bytes on disk and ZERO in their blobs -- six ``.txt``
transcripts under ``evidence/assembly-rehearsal-20260828/``, four under
``evidence/repin-258-20260828/``, and ``PLAIN-LANGUAGE.md`` and
``RECEIPT.md`` under ``evidence/cpr-bias-20260828/``.  Those came from
shell redirection on Windows rather than from Python, and they are
harmless as transcripts; they are recorded here because they show the
class is real and that no blob-reading check can find it.

Where it stops being harmless is any digest taken FROM DISK.  This port
pins ``.nc``, ``.npy`` and ``.npz`` payloads by SHA-256 through its proof
guards, and a receipt that hashes its own inputs on a Windows machine
disagrees with the same commit on a Linux one, with both blobs identical.

``Path.write_text`` is the Python half of that: it opens in TEXT mode, so
on Windows it translates every "\\n" to "\\r\\n" on the way out.  That is
the right default for scratch and run directories, which is where nearly
all of this repository's writes go.  Four call sites, in three files, had
a receiver that resolved to a path this repository TRACKS, and those four
now pass ``newline="\\n"``.  This module pins them red-on-revert.
