"""The boundary-zone shell check, and the test it replaced.

A limited-area mesh's relaxation zone is seven rings, and ring ``k`` is staged
against ring ``k-1`` every step.  ``Mesh.validate`` has to refuse a zone whose
rings do not actually sit on one another, because such a zone blends from a
ring that does not reach it and nothing announces the hole.

It used to check that instead by requiring ring POPULATIONS to grow outward.
That is true on a uniform mesh and false on a variable-resolution one -- and
variable resolution is the only kind this program culls.  Measured on the proving RTX 5090
on 2026-08-27: three culls of one parent, one binary, one run, one of them
byte-identical to the registered ``r4.75.11020``, and the old check refused
two of them.  The refused ones are legitimate: their rings grow outward into
the parent's coarsening ramp, so each ring wraps a LONGER perimeter with
FEWER, WIDER cells.

Both directions are asserted here, because both failure modes are silent:

* a zone whose populations shrink outward but whose rings all sit on the ring
  inside them is ADMITTED -- otherwise the culler's own output is refused and
  a lane loses meshes it correctly built;
* a zone with a genuinely detached ring cell is REFUSED by name -- otherwise
  the check is a formality that passes everything.
