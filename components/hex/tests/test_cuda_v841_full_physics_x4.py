    THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS, and it is not hypothetical: this test used to
    assert three of those rows against a second copy of the same literals, so
    it compared the table to itself and passed while every row in it was
    wrong.  All four contract digests are computed at import over a document
    that frames a MODULE NAME into itself, the 0.2.0 rename moved all four,
    and nothing here noticed.  What did notice was a card: the first composite
    step of every full-physics forecast refused with

        ValueError: external GWDO provenance gwdo_contract_sha256 changed:
        <what the module computed> != <what config_v841 restated>

    raised by ``CudaPhaseOneExecutionProvenanceV841.validate`` against
    ``config_v841.V841_GWDO_CONTRACT_SHA256``.  A pin that only a card-tier
    gate reads is a pin that goes stale silently and fails on the node at the
    start of a booked run, so this one now has a CPU-tier gate.

    Two of the six rows the sweep moved had been stale since BEFORE the
    rename and are recorded here so nobody re-derives them a second time
    wondering what happened.  ``coupling_kernel_sha256`` spelled a value
    that appears in no source and in no receipt in this tree, while all 564
    archived receipts carrying that field report the computed one; and
    ``adapter_contract_sha256`` spelled the value that was live until the
    2.5.8 engine re-pin moved the adapter authority document under it.

    The re-derivation lives in ``tools/repin_source_tables.py``
