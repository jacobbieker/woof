"""The surface/PBL cadence: welded by default, selectable by the second.

``config_bldt_seconds`` is welded to ``config_dt`` by default -- the native
x4 v8.4.1 reference ran ``bldt = dt`` -- and at the 5 s a sub-kilometre
mesh declares that is 720 surface/PBL calls an hour against the proven
configuration's 30.  ``--pbl-cadence SECONDS`` calls the stack once every
``SECONDS / dt`` steps and holds its tendency on the steps between (the
engine's own positive-``bldt`` path).  It changes the forecast, so it is
SELECTABLE and never silently the default -- the project's rule for modes
that change results -- and the welded default moves only on a measured
recommendation.

**The refusal.**  A cadence that is not a whole number of steps is refused
on the host, naming both numbers, the multiples of ``dt`` on either side and
the way out, before a mesh is bound or a card is reserved.

**The admission.**  A held cadence at an anchored ``(dt, cumulus)`` is
admitted through a row DERIVED from the welded anchor: the dycore half is
the welded row's own (the outer step, its schedule and its byte-identical
dual run are properties of the timestep), the host half is re-minted for the
held cadence, and the physics band is stamped NOT MEASURED rather than
borrowed.  The derived row has its own registry key, so the breakage the key
fragment prevents -- a held run quoting a band measured at 24x its own call
rate -- cannot recur; a registered held row still wins the exact lookup; and
a held cadence at an unanchored timestep is refused as the welded run would
be.

Everything here runs on a CPU-only box.
