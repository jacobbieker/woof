"""The wheel-reach defect: an installed wheel must reach its own shipped modules.

Two gates in this program digest the port's modules by name, and both used
to resolve those names by assuming a source checkout under the file doing
the asking.  From a wheel that assumption lands on ``<venv>/lib/python3.13``,
which holds no ``src/``, so the regional digest refused and took 0.2.0's
headline limited-area lane with it on every machine.  Measured before the
fix on Linux (``evidence/xmachine-20260827`` section 6b) and on Windows
(``evidence/wheel-reach-20260827`` section 2).

EVERY TEST HERE IS WRITTEN BOTH WAYS.  A resolution fix is exactly the kind
of change that can be "proven" by a test that would pass with the gate
removed, so each admission below has a refusal beside it that exercises the
same code path with one byte moved.
