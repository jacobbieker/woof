"""Refusal and marker text computes from the admission surface.

Stale-guard audit, finding 9: the bigcard tier's refusal strings in
``tests/conftest.py`` and the marker/comment text in ``pyproject.toml``
restated the retired 26.4 GiB figure (and the superseded 08-24 footprint
row) after the constant itself moved to the computed ~20.6 GiB floor.  A
string that restates a number the code no longer uses is a second copy of
the constant with no test on it; these tests make the strings either
compute from ``X4_FULL_PHYSICS_BYTES`` / the admission surface or name the
surface instead of a number.
