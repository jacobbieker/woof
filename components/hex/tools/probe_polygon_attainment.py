"""Does the generator's own polygon attainment tell the truth? Measured.

the ruling is that a receipt quotes ATTAINED spacing and never
requested.  The swath layer emits ``polygon`` regions, so the number it
would naturally quote is the ``attained_spacing_km`` in the polygon's row
of ``rw_mpas_mesh --dry-run``'s ``region_attainment`` block.  This probe
asks whether that number can be trusted, by putting the SAME request
through the SAME binary as a polygon and as a cap covering comparable
ground, and comparing.

The verifier has teeth in both directions: the cap arm is the control, and
if it also reported its request exactly met at every size the probe would
prove nothing about polygons.

Committed so the claim is re-checkable rather than remembered.
