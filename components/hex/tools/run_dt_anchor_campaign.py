"""Earn one model-timestep anchor's INTEGRATION half on one card.

``tools/mint_dt_anchor.py`` mints the host-derivable half of an anchor and
prints the procedure for the half that needs a card.  This is that procedure,
run rather than printed, as one self-contained job per timestep per card:

1. a **control arm** at the anchored timestep, through the ordinary forecast
   door, on this card, this mesh, this init.  Its per-step health band is what
   the candidate's band is read against -- a band compared across cards or
   across cases would be measuring the card or the case;
2. **two candidate arms** at the timestep being earned, each a separate
   process, each through ``mint_dt_anchor.py --candidate-forecast`` so the
   run is stamped ``CANDIDATE-UNANCHORED`` in its own receipt;
3. the **digest comparison** of every history frame the two candidate arms
   wrote, which is what "byte-identical" means here.  Each digest is labelled
   with the convention that produced it: the house ``file_id``-masked SHA-256
   on a classic-CDF file, and the plain whole-file SHA-256 on the port's own
   ``NETCDF4_CLASSIC``-on-HDF5 frames, which carry no ``file_id`` nonce to
   mask.  See :func:`frame_digest`, which refuses to fall back onto a
   non-classic file that does carry one; and
4. the **health band** of all three arms, side by side, so a closure that
   misbehaves at a higher call rate is visible as a number rather than
   inferred from the run not crashing.

Point 4 is the reason this tool exists instead of a shell loop.  Two
byte-identical forecasts prove the run is deterministic and finite.  They do
not prove the physics is well behaved: WRF pins ``cudt = 0`` for
Grell-Freitas, so the cumulus closure is called every step and a smaller
timestep calls it proportionally more often -- 30 times an hour at 120 s, 720
at 5 s.  Whether that closure still behaves at 24x its proven call rate is a
question only measurement answers, and only obs-skill settles.  This tool
records the measurement; it does not settle the question, and it says so in
its own output.

The result is written as one JSON per timestep plus an rc-gated marker, so a
long leg can run detached and be adjudicated by its marker rather than by
watching it.

Nothing here registers anything.  Registering an anchor moves the frozen lane
off its proven timestep, which is a ruling.

    The house masked digest NULs the netCDF ``file_id`` attribute, because a

    two identical runs would otherwise differ.  It is defined only against the
    classic CDF-1/2/5 header layout and refuses anything else by name.

    The port's own writer does not produce that layout: measured on a real
    frame (2026-08-26, the proving RTX 5090), ``cuda-history.*.nc`` is ``NETCDF4_CLASSIC``
    on HDF5 and its global attributes are ``schema``, ``source``,
    ``arwen_commit``, the four GF/q2 provenance strings and
    ``refl10cm_provenance`` -- there is **no** ``file_id``.  The nonce is a
    native artefact, not a port one, so on these files there is nothing to
    mask and the whole-file SHA-256 IS the content digest.  That is also the
    digest the driver itself records per frame in ``snapshot_files`` and the
    one every previous determinism claim in this tree was made with.

    Falling back silently would be the defect, so this refuses to fall back
    onto a file that DOES carry a nonce, and it labels every digest with the
