"""Write a history file for the swath placement layer to be tested against.

WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT.  The MESH is real when ``--grid`` names a
real MPAS grid file, and the WRITER is always the port's own shipped
``woof.hex.output.write_history`` -- so the detector is read against the
real writer's on-disk conventions (one-based ``cellsOnCell`` with zero
padding, radians, MPAS time strings), never against a file this tool
wrote to its own taste.  That is deliberate: a reader tested only against
its own fixture agrees with itself and with nothing else.

The FIELDS are analytic.  A moving Gaussian pressure well with a
tangential circulation around it is not a tropical cyclone, and this tool
does not claim it is.  What it exercises is the mechanism: does a
mesh-native extremum search find a moving minimum, does the association
join it into one track, does the flared ring land on the projected path,
does the ranking put the deeper one first, does the delayed start fire on
the hour the field first exceeds.  The meteorology is proven by running
the same layer on a real coarse forecast, which needs a card; the receipt
in ``evidence/swath-following-20260826/`` states which legs are which.

Storms are ROWS.  Adding one to a scenario is a dict in a list, never a
branch -- the same discipline the layer under test is held to.
