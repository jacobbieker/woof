"""Moved into the package: ``woof.hex.drivers.mpas_mesh_binding``.

The forecast drivers ship inside the wheel since 0.3.2, so ``woof hex
forecast`` runs from an install.  This path stays so a script that loads this
file, or imports ``mpas_mesh_binding`` with ``tools/`` on ``sys.path``, keeps
working: both reach the one packaged module, never a second copy of it.
