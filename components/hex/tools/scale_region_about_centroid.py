"""Shrink or grow a Shape row about its own centroid, on the sphere.

WHAT THIS IS FOR, AND IT IS ONE QUESTION.  A limited-area forecast takes its
lateral boundary from a parent whose cells are about fifteen times wider than
its own.  Nobody nests that hard in WRF.  The suspicion is that such a boundary
cannot hand the child the scales it needs and so starves the interior; the
competing explanation is that the child is correctly resolving structure the
parent cannot represent at all, which would make a low correlation the RIGHT
answer rather than a defect.  Comparing child against parent cannot separate
those two, in either direction, because both predict exactly the same
disagreement.

What separates them is running the SAME resolution over the SAME ground at two
domain sizes and comparing the two children over the smaller one's interior.
If the boundary is starving the interior, the smaller domain -- whose interior
sits closer to its own boundary -- disagrees with the larger one, and the
disagreement grows toward its edge.  If the interiors agree, the boundary is
not the mechanism and an intermediate resolution level buys nothing.

This emits the second and third domains.  A cull moves no cell centre, so
three nested culls of ONE parent share their cells' coordinate bits exactly and
the comparison needs no interpolation anywhere.

THE SCALING IS GEODESIC, NOT IN DEGREES.  Scaling latitude and longitude by a
factor is a different shape at every latitude and at 60 S -- where the measured
case sits -- it would squash the polygon by half in one axis.  Each vertex is
carried to a 3-D unit vector, the centroid is the normalised mean of those
vectors, and the vertex is moved along the great circle toward the centroid by
``1 - factor`` of its own angular distance.  That is a similarity transform on
the sphere: it preserves the shape's angular proportions about its centre and
scales every centroid-to-vertex arc by exactly ``factor``.

The output is a Shape row exactly as ``rw_mpas_mesh --region`` and
``woof hex cull --region`` read one, so nothing downstream learns that a
region was scaled.
