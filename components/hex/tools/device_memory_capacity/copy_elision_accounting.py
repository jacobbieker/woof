WHY THERE IS NO DEFAULT. These once defaulted to the 2026-08-20 model. The
Grell-Freitas local-memory frame cut superseded it on 2026-08-24, and both
terms moved in OPPOSITE directions: the fixed term FELL by 3501.3 MiB and the
slope ROSE by 6844 B/cell. The two errors partly cancel, so a bare run did not
fail loudly -- it produced a plausible fit verdict that was wrong, and exited
0. Naming the model is what makes the answer readable. (And the same drift
then bit this very text: until 2026-08-25 the "of record" arm below still
named the 08-24 row after the converged row superseded it -- stale-guard
audit, finding 7. A test now pins the of-record arm to
device_admission.FLOOR_DERIVATION so the two cannot disagree again.)

THERE IS NO AFFINE ROW OF RECORD ANY MORE, AND THIS TOOL CANNOT ASK THE
CURRENT QUESTION. As of 2026-08-27 the admission surface is not
`fixed + slope * cells`: it is a card core, plus physics workspaces sized to
`min(cells, tile(card))` -- which stop growing once the mesh is bigger than
the card -- plus a per-cell term. Every arm below is HISTORICAL. For any NEW
question about what fits a card today, ask the surface instead:

    from woof.hex.device_admission import KNOWN_CARDS, model_for_card
    model_for_card(KNOWN_CARDS["10gib-68sm"]).required_bytes(40_962)

Passing an affine pair to this tool now answers a question about a retired
row, and the answer is only meaningful against the arm it was computed
against. evidence/memory-shape-20260827/ is why.

THE HISTORICAL MODELS. Pick by the arm you are reproducing:

              session; evidence/memory-row-refit-20260826/.
              RETIRED FOR SHAPE, not for provenance: it did not cover six of
              seventeen recorded runs and was 1,104 MiB short on a
              limited-area cull.  Computable at

              cautionary case: it was a good measurement of a tree that had
              already moved on, and the tip moved BOTH terms in opposite
              directions, so the errors partly cancel between about 100k and
              200k cells and a bare comparison looks plausible.
