"""Give a culled child file the lineage its parent already had.

WHY THIS EXISTS, and the concrete breakage it removes.

``rw_mpas_mesh --cull-parent`` reproduces MPAS-Limited-Area v2.2 byte for
byte, and that tool writes exactly two global attributes into the regional
file -- ``on_a_sphere`` and ``sphere_radius``.  Everything else in the
parent's header is dropped.  That is correct and it is an anchor: the cull is
byte-identical to the native tool on all three reference culls and nothing
here may move it.

``rw_mpas_lbc`` reads its child's header for twelve lineage attributes
(``model_name``, ``core_name``, ``version``, ``source``, ``Conventions``,
``git_version``, the five mesh-geometry attributes, and ``mesh_spec``) plus
``file_id``, and refuses by name rather than invent one -- *"inventing a value
here would stamp the stream with an identity its mesh never had"*.  A culled
child therefore cannot be handed to the boundary producer at all.

TWO THINGS ARE MISSING AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME MISSING.

1. The attributes the parent HAD and the cull dropped.  Those are copied
   verbatim.  The child's lineage IS the parent's lineage: a cull moves no
   cell centre, invents no field and changes no configuration.
2. ~~Four attributes THE PARENT NEVER HAD.~~  **RETIRED 2026-08-26.**  This
   tool used to MINT ``model_name``, ``core_name``, ``version`` and
   ``git_version`` because no init this program produced carried them, which
   made every woof hex init unusable as a boundary producer's ``--grid``.
   The engine writes them now: ``rw_mpas_init`` takes the four as optional
   switches, defaults them to its own identity, and the init door passes this
   port's (``woof hex``, never ``mpas``).  A parent minted at or after that
   change carries all four and they are CARRIED like everything else.
   Minting survives only as a fallback for a parent minted BEFORE it, and
   the receipt still records which were carried and which were minted so a
   reader can tell an old parent from a new one at a glance.

Usage::

    python tools/carry_lineage_to_cull.py --parent PARENT.nc --child CULL.nc \
        --receipt lineage.json
