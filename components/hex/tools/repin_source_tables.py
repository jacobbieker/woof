"""Re-derive every table in this repository that pins THIS repository's own
sources by path and SHA-256.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.  Eight tables in three directories carry the digest of a
file that also lives in this tree.  Any change that moves those bytes -- a
provenance scrub, an import rewrite, the 0.2.0 package rename from
``mpas_port`` to ``woof.hex`` -- lapses every one of them at once, and the
failure mode is not a clean red.  Several of these tables are read only by
gates that need a CUDA card, so a stale row there is SILENT on a developer box
and surfaces hours later, on the node, as a refusal to launch the proof the
run was booked for.  That happened three times in this tree before this file
existed:

* ``8aeb582`` edited a docstring in ``cuda_arwen_physics_v841.py`` and left
  ``EXECUTION_SOURCE_PINS`` naming the pre-edit digest, so
  ``require_frozen_execution_sources`` refused with *"frozen execution source
  changed d10eaeef... != ..."* and the x4 full-physics proof could not start.
* ``AUTHORITY_PINS_SHA256`` (``8fb3d656...``) and ``EXPECTED_RUNNER_SHA256``
  (``4d38c89a...``) arrived with the base import at ``8a34759`` and were
  killed by ``36802f8`` and ``0911c88``.  Both sat dead for weeks, because
  nothing that runs without a card reads either one.

HAND-PATCHING IS THE BUG, NOT THE FIX.  A person re-deriving forty-odd rows
with a shell loop gets forty of them.  So the derivation is a program, it
lives beside the tables it writes, and the next rename is a re-run of

    python tools/repin_source_tables.py --write

THE FIXED POINT IS REAL.  ``cuda_ftz_v841_authority_pins.json`` carries the
digest of ``run_cuda_ftz_contract.py`` INSIDE it, and ``AUTHORITY_PINS_SHA256``
is the digest of that json, so writing the first value moves the second's
input.  ``--write`` therefore iterates until a whole pass changes nothing, and
refuses to claim success if it does not converge.

WHAT THIS PROGRAM MUST NEVER TOUCH, and does not:

* ``MPAS_SEAM_CONTRACT_SURFACE_SHA256`` in ``woof.hex.cuda_arwen_physics_v841``
  -- the digest of the ENGINE's seam contract, held by
  ``tests/test_engine_seam_contract.py``.  It moves only after the contract
  decks and the x4 anchor are re-run on a new contract, never by re-deriving.
* a provider row's cross-pin of engine files -- engine files too.
* ``_GPUWM_STARTUP_CLOSURE_PINS`` and the ``gpuwm_sources`` / ``gpuwm_receipt``
  blocks of the ftz authority pins -- engine again.
* the ``recorded`` half of ``SOURCE_DRIFT_SINCE_CAMPAIGN`` -- the bytes an
  ARCHIVED receipt was produced by.  Only ``current`` moves; the pair is the
  gate.
* every digest of a MESH, a snapshot, a namelist or a compile manifest.  Those
  are measurements of data or of a card, not of this repository's source, and
  re-deriving one from the tree would be a fabrication.

Usage:  ``--check`` (the default) exits 1 on any drift and prints it;
        ``--write`` rewrites in place and re-checks until it converges.
