"""A differently-rungged ladder is one number in one row, and nothing else.

the ruling on the cascade was "build the ladder if it earns it, and the
ratios are ours to choose", with the standing condition that the number of
levels must be DATA -- tunable later without a lane.

In MPAS an intermediate resolution level is not another forecast.  The parent
is a variable-resolution mesh that ramps from the swath's own spacing out to
the background, so the atmosphere between the fine core and the cut is already
resolved at intermediate resolutions.  Cutting the limited-area domain at the
swath ring throws all of that away and hands a 71 km parent state to cells the
fine core's own size; cutting wider keeps it.  How much to keep is
``cull_pad_scale``, one number on one swath row.

So "the number of levels" is not even a discrete rung list -- it is a
continuous choice of how much of the parent's ramp to hold, and a
differently-rungged ladder is a different number in a JSON row.

THIS ASSERTS THE ABSENCE OF THE EDIT, which is the half a unit test cannot
see.  ``tests/test_swath_plan.py`` proves a row declaring 1.35 gets a cut
1.35x wider while its mesh spec is untouched; this proves the tree did not
move while that happened.
