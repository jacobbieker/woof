"""The carried physics, as the runtime reaches it.

`tests/test_resync_core_carve.py` holds the CUT: that the files here are the
source tree's, byte for byte where it matters, and that the tool can re-cut
them.  This file holds the RUNTIME: that the package imports them, that the
loader binds this directory rather than the engine's, that the physics runtime
asks for the carried names, and that a receipt says whose physics integrated.

WHY THE LOADER BINDING IS ITS OWN TEST.  `woof/globe/core/kernels/__init__.py`
is byte-identical to the engine's.  The only thing that makes it read this
package's kernels is `_KDIR = Path(__file__).parent`, and the failure mode is
silent in the worst way: if a carried module resolved the ENGINE's loader, it
would compile the engine's `.cu` while every Python file in this package said
otherwise, and the run would produce numbers from a scheme nobody selected.

WHAT NEEDS A CARD AND WHAT DOES NOT.  `module_source` reads and assembles the
kernel string with no CUDA at all, so the binding is provable on any host.
Compiling it is not; that is the `gpu` mark, and the card it needs is named in
the skip.
