"""Score one arm of a reflectivity A/B on more than the headline number.

:mod:`tools.da_sweep_score` is the axis of record: it reproduces
``NowcastRender.verify_numbers`` step for step and its numbers land on
the same scale as everything already published.  This module does not
replace it and does not re-derive it.  It **calls** it -- every leg goes
through :func:`tools.da_sweep_score.score_leg` and the result is copied
into the payload verbatim under ``published_axis`` -- and then adds the
diagnostics an A/B needs and a single skill score cannot carry.

Four additions, and each one exists because a specific way of being
wrong is invisible without it.

**A per-member statistic beside the mean-field score.**  The published
number scores the ENSEMBLE MEAN: member composites are averaged into one
deterministic dBZ map and that map is scored.  Averaging is a smoother,
so the mean-field score is a function of how the ensemble is *shaped*
and not only of how skilful its members are -- an arm that spreads its
members further can move the mean-field number with no member getting
better, and an arm that collapses them can move it with no member
getting worse.  Assimilating reflectivity changes ensemble structure by
construction, so on this comparison the mean-field number cannot be read
alone.  Every member is therefore scored on its own and the
distribution is reported next to the mean field.

**Counts outside the observed echo.**  ``score_leg`` reports
``fcst_cols_gt35_in_echo`` -- forecast cores counted only where the
observation found echo somewhere in the column.  That is the right
denominator for "did the run make enough storm where storm was", which
is the failure the velocity-only arm has.  It is also structurally blind
to a core invented where nothing was observed, because such a core is
outside the mask and is never counted.  A run that fixes its
under-production by growing spurious convection would look like a pure
win.  So the whole-domain count and the outside-the-echo count are both
reported.

**A false-alarm side.**  Bias (forecast count over observed count) says
nothing about placement: a run can have exactly the right number of
cores and put every one in the wrong place.  A 2x2 contingency table at
the same 35 dBZ column threshold gives POD, FAR, CSI and frequency bias
over the whole domain, so a rise in skill that was bought with false
alarms is visible as CSI falling while bias rises.  This is also the
only view in which suppression -- the thing clear-air observations are
for -- can show up at all: suppression's whole effect is on
``false_alarms`` and on cores standing in observed-clear columns, and
neither term appears in a bias-only or in-echo-only view.

**A curve, not a point.**  FSS at one neighborhood is a scalar with a
free parameter baked into it.  A displacement error smaller than the box
is invisible; a gain that appears only at the widest box is a statement
about displacement tolerance, not about placement.  The score is
therefore evaluated across a ladder of half-widths with the published
one (4 cells at 3 km) among them, so the shape of the gain can be read.

The neighborhood convention is ``da_sweep_score``'s and is restated
because it is the number a comparison against published skill turns on:
the half-width is a count of cells, the scored box is
``2 * half_width + 1`` cells ACROSS, and it is a square SIDE LENGTH, not
a radius.  ``fss_distance`` smooths BOTH fields -- forecast and truth --
to that box before comparing them.

No case names belong here.  Directories, legs and labels are arguments.
