"""Checkout entry point for the prepared single-domain forecast runner.

The runner's substance now lives in
:mod:`woof.prepared_single_domain_forecast`, inside the installed
package, and this file is a thin delegation to it.

**Why it moved.**  A ``pip install recast-woof`` gives a reader the CLI, the
front doors and the model -- and, until this change, no way to run a
GFS forecast, because the last two stages of the documented chain were
a script path under ``tools/`` that only a git checkout has.  "Install
the product, then clone the repository to use it" is not an install.
The implementation is therefore part of the package, reachable as
``python -m woof.prepared_single_domain_forecast`` (and as the
``woof-prepared-forecast`` console script) from any environment that
has the wheel.

**Why this file stays.**  ``docs/public/FIRST-LIGHT.md``, retained
campaign receipts and years of pasted transcripts name
``python tools/prepared_single_domain_forecast.py``.  That command still
works, unchanged, from a checkout.

**One implementation, two entries.**  There is no copy here: the module
object this file exposes IS the package module, aliased into
``sys.modules`` so that ``import tools.prepared_single_domain_forecast``
and ``import woof.prepared_single_domain_forecast`` are the same object
with the same private helpers.  A twin runner that could drift is
exactly what a receipt must never have to disambiguate.

The registry route id ``tools.prepared_single_domain_forecast`` is
unchanged: it names a route in the physics registry, not an import path.
