"""Stage the built Rust artifacts INTO the package, for a platform wheel.

``pip install recast-woof`` used to land a Python half with no compiled Rust at
all: every decoder, the fetch backbone, the renderer and the radar front
door were downloaded afterwards by ``woof setup`` / ``woof
fetch-bridges``.  That made the post-install step a failure surface on
the one command every user runs first, and it made "the decode runs in
Rust" unreachable on a bare install -- which is the whole point of doing
the decode in Rust.

This tool closes that by copying the artifacts
:data:`woof.bridge_assets.BUNDLED_ARTIFACTS` declares out of the two
Cargo workspaces and into :func:`woof.bridges.packaged_bridge_dir`
(``woof/libexec/bridges``), which
``[tool.setuptools.package-data]`` sweeps into the wheel.  Run it
between ``cargo build --release`` and ``python -m build``; the resulting
wheel is platform-tagged by ``setup.py`` because it now carries native
code.

It is deliberately NOT a build step: it copies bytes that already exist
and refuses when they do not, so a wheel can never be built with a
silently missing artifact and ship a door that dies at first use.

    python tools/stage_wheel_bridges.py --platform win-x86_64
    python tools/stage_wheel_bridges.py --clean

``--dest DIR`` points the same table-driven copy at a directory other
than the package, which is what completes a HOME from a build tree::

    python tools/stage_wheel_bridges.py --dest ~/.woof/bridges

That rung -- ``woof.bridges.default_bridge_dir`` -- is the last one
every resolver searches, and it is the rung a wheel-less checkout user
fills.  Filling it by hand is how a home came to carry sixteen of the
declared artifacts, missing the NetCDF decoder and the NetCDF writer
behind the default wrfout engine; a hand copy has no declaration to
check itself against and this tool does.  Only the in-package
destination is emptied first (a wheel carrying two platforms is both
wrong and over PyPI's cap); any other destination keeps everything this
tool did not stage.

What is NOT staged, and why: the renderer's basemap shapefiles.  They
are 21.1 MB compressed, and there is no room for them.  They are also
DATA (Natural Earth coastlines and county polygons), not a processing
path.  Since 2.8.0 they ship in the ``recast-woof-data`` companion, which
every install pulls, and :func:`woof.rustwx.renderer_env` hands that
copy to this wheel's renderer; before that they reached a wheel install
only through ``woof fetch-bridges``, which no install text ran, and
every picture came out with no coastlines, borders or state lines.

Sizes, measured 2026-08-17 at the 2.5.0 integration tip, against
PyPI's 100 MB per-file cap read strictly as 100,000,000 B::

    pure wheel      gpuwm-2.5.0-py3-none-any.whl          91,926,618 B
    pure sdist      gpuwm-2.5.0.tar.gz                    95,245,042 B
    win-x86_64      gpuwm-2.5.0-py3-none-win_amd64.whl   108,695,109 B
    linux-x86_64    ...-manylinux_2_28_x86_64.whl        111,697,820 B

The pure pair is what ``.github/workflows/publish.yml`` ships (it runs
``--clean`` first) and it fits, with 8.07 MB of headroom on the wheel
and 4.75 MB on the sdist -- the sdist, not the wheel, is the binding
constraint of the published pair.  The win and linux numbers are this
Windows host and a development machine respectively; the linux one is from the
2.5.0 Linux shakeout, everything else was measured together on one box.

BOTH PLATFORM WHEELS ARE OVER THE CAP AT THIS TIP -- by 8.70 MB and
11.70 MB.  The bridge payload has roughly doubled since these numbers
were last written (compressed, it is now 16.77 MB on Windows and 19.77
MB on Linux over the pure base), which is ``rw_netcdf``,
``netcdf_writer`` and ``region_global_dealias`` joining
:data:`woof.bridge_assets.BUNDLED_ARTIFACTS`.  Whatever this docstring
claimed before, do not read a headroom number off it again without
re-measuring: the figures it carried into this tip (96.66 MB win, 98.35
MB linux, "1.65 MB of headroom on Linux") were 12-13 MB low and had the
sign inverted -- the wheels were over the cap while the doc said they
were under it, and the whole documented rationale for excluding the
basemaps rested on that dead number.

Nothing published is broken by this: the per-platform wheel is not a
shape PyPI receives today.  The remedy for making it one is the
companion split -- the payload moves into a companion distribution
rather than a decoder being dropped -- and until that lands, a platform
wheel built here is a local artifact, not an uploadable one.
``tools/verify_release_artifacts.py`` measures every distribution file
in the dist directory against the cap and refuses the ones a cut is
about to publish, so this cannot be discovered at upload time with the
tag already public.

67 MB of the pure base is physics tables (Thompson and RRTMGP).  If the
PURE pair ever runs out of room, the remedy is externalising another
table through ``woof fetch-tables`` -- the route ``freezeH2O.dat`` and
``qr_acr_qg_V4.dat`` already take -- rather than dropping a decoder.
