"""Draw a box on a map, see what it costs, start the nowcast.

``python -m tools.da_nowcast_launcher serve --work-root DIR`` opens a
local page on 127.0.0.1.  Drag a box over the map, pick a grid spacing
and an ensemble size, and the page answers -- BEFORE anything is
launched -- with the grid the box fits, the memory verdict, the radar
sites that cover it, and an estimate of what one assimilation cycle will
cost in wall-clock seconds.  Press the button and
:mod:`tools.da_nowcast_auto` starts on that box.

**A thin driver, not a second implementation.**  Every answer the page
gives comes from the shipped thing that owns it:

    grid + memory   ``woof domain`` (the wizard fits the box, sizes the
                    ladder and runs the memory preflight; if it refuses,
                    the page shows its refusal and offers no override)
    radar sites     ``rw_nexrad sites`` -- the vendored site table, one
                    subprocess, never a list typed into this file
    the run itself  ``tools.da_nowcast_auto start``, exactly the command
                    line a person could type, printed on the page
    progress        the daemon's own ``gpuwm-da.nowcast-auto.v1`` status
                    file, polled and passed through unchanged

The only thing this module computes for itself is the wall-clock
estimate, and it is one measurement scaled by cell-steps with its basis
printed beside it.

**Offline.**  The page is one self-contained document: the basemap is
inlined from the same vendored Natural Earth assets the gallery draws
from, and there is no CDN, no external font, no external script.  It
loads with the network unplugged.

**Refusals are polite and specific.**  A box too small to hold a storm
and the ground it will cover, a box whose grid the card cannot hold, a
box whose cycle would take longer than the radar takes to produce the
next volume: each is refused with the number that made it so.

No radar-site names in this file, its defaults or its identifiers: the
site table is data read at runtime, and the site is an argument the
caller chooses from what covers their box (standing owner rule).

    The ADVANCE half is linear in the ensemble size, because the
