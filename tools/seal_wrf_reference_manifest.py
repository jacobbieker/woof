"""Seal a WRF reference manifest from a measurement taken on the compute node.

    python tools/seal_wrf_reference_manifest.py \
        --capture evidence/<lane>/wrf-reference-measurement-<date>.txt \
        --config configs/<the configuration>.toml

A manifest is a receipt, so nothing here invents a digest.  Every hash the
manifest carries either comes out of the capture -- a file written by hashing
bytes on the machine that holds them -- or is taken from a document committed
beside the manifest.  Re-running this command on an unchanged tree rewrites the
manifest byte for byte, which is what makes a hand-edited manifest detectable
by the tool that made it.

The tool refuses rather than guesses:

* if the committed namelists do not hash to what the node measured, the
  committed text is not the text that ran, and that is a corruption of the
  receipt, not a formatting difference;
* if any of the four required hash groups would come out absent, it refuses --
  the same condition ``woof certify`` refuses on, caught before the manifest
  is written rather than after it is committed.

## The capture format

A capture is plain text so that the person who ran it can read what they
signed.  Lines outside a section, and lines beginning with ``#``, are prose.
A ``[section]`` header opens a section; inside one, ``key=value`` lines carry
the measurements.  Sections read here:

``[wrf_exe]``
    ``wrf.exe=<digest>`` -- the executable that produced the reference stream.

``[namelists]``
    ``<file name>=<digest>`` for every namelist the reference run consumed.
    A key carrying a dot-suffixed qualifier (``namelist.input.config_copy``)
    is a corroborating second reading of another entry, not a namelist of its
    own, and is checked against its base entry rather than published.

``[reference_wrfout_frames]``
    ``<frame name>=<digest>  bytes=<size>`` for every reference frame the
    comparison scored.  The size is recorded for the reader; the manifest
    publishes the digest.

Top-level ``key=value`` lines carry ``wrf_version`` and ``wrf_commit``.
