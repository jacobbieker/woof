"""Fail when a case or data-source token leaks into a generic position.

A token naming one specific case or forcing source (a campaign date, a city,
an upstream model acronym) is legitimate in case data, in a source-specific
adapter, and in test fixtures.  It is never legitimate in a *generic*
position, because a model quietly specialized to one data source cannot be
re-pointed at another without a rewrite, and the specialization stays
invisible until someone tries.

This gate therefore does not scan everything.  It scans the zones where the
rule says a case token must never appear:

  * the numerical core,
  * configuration defaults and schema,
  * physics identifiers and the physics registry,
  * generically-selected runner names.

Within those zones only *code* positions are checked -- identifiers and
identifier-shaped string literals.  Comments and docstrings are ignored on
purpose: a provenance note recording which run pinned a constant is
documentation, not specialization, and rewriting those in bulk would bury the
signal this gate exists to surface.

Suppression is position-aware
-----------------------------
Every occurrence carries a *position* as well as a file and a spelling, and
the baseline is keyed on all three::

    <relative path>::<position>::<kind>::<text>

where the position is

  * a RFC 6901 JSON Pointer for ``.json`` documents,
  * ``<scope qualname>#<ordinal>`` for Python, where the ordinal counts
    occurrences of that same (kind, text) inside that same scope in source
    order, and
  * ``#<ordinal>`` for Rust, counted over the whole file.

Positions are deliberately line-independent: a baseline keyed on line numbers
would fire on every unrelated edit above it, and a gate that cries wolf gets
switched off.  Counting occurrences instead makes the key stable under moves
and still sensitive to *addition* -- a second ``hrrr`` in a scope that had one
is ordinal ``#2``, which no baseline entry covers, so it is reported.

An earlier version of this gate keyed suppression on ``<path>::<text>`` alone.
That is position-blind: one baseline entry for ``hrrr`` in the physics
registry suppressed ``hrrr`` *anywhere* in that document, including as a
physics-template id or a component option key -- the two positions this
module's own rules call illegitimate.  It happened: commit ``af04478`` added a
source id to a route and the gate printed a clean bill of health.  Do not
reintroduce a key that drops the position.

There is also no shape-based auto-suppression any more.  A rule of the form
"anything under ``source_ids`` is data, therefore fine" re-opens exactly that
hole one level up: the next source id appended to that list is absorbed
without anyone reading it.  Declaring that a route serves a given source
really is legitimate, but it is legitimate *one entry at a time*, so each such
entry earns a baseline line with a written reason instead.

Imports are checked, including through the name
---------------------------------------------
A per-file scanner that only reads identifiers and literals cannot see a
specialization that arrives by import.  Two shapes get through:

  * ``import woof.ingest.hrrr`` / ``from woof.ingest.hrrr import Snapshot``
    in a protected module -- the token is in the ``Import`` node, which is
    neither a ``Name`` nor a string constant, so nothing recorded it; and

  * ``from woof.verify.nest_gates import CHILD_REFERENCE_FRAMES``, where the
    *name* is perfectly generic and the *value* it is bound to is one case's
    frame table.  The importing file reads clean to any scanner that never
    opens the file it imports from.

Both are now recorded, the second by resolving the import to a file inside
the scanned root, finding the module-scope binding of the imported name, and
scanning the expression it is bound to (following re-exports, with a visited
set).  Only in-tree modules are resolved -- third-party packages are not this
gate's business -- and a name bound to a function or a class is not followed,
because the rule is about specialized *data* reaching generic code.

Usage
-----
    python tools/check_case_token_leakage.py <path> [<path> ...]
    python tools/check_case_token_leakage.py <path> --emit-baseline

An argument is a path to scan, NOT a root the zones are spelled against.
Every zone above is relative to a REPOSITORY root, so each argument is
resolved by walking up to the nearest directory that actually holds one of
them; the argument then narrows the scan to the zones inside it.  ``.`` and
``woof`` and ``woof/core/dyn`` are all lawful, and all report paths -- and
therefore baseline keys -- relative to the repository.

THE BREAKAGE THAT NAMES THIS, measured at ``b858ad824``: the arguments used
to be handed to :func:`scan_root` as roots.  With ``root=woof`` the zone
``woof/core/`` resolved to ``woof/woof/core``, which does not exist, so
``python tools/check_case_token_leakage.py woof tools tests docs`` -- the
line every lane and every close/verify wave ran by hand -- scanned ZERO
files and printed the same clean bill of health a clean tree prints.  Months
of hand-runs and reports quoted a scan of nothing as a green gate.  So the
count of files scanned is now printed on every run, and a target that
selects no zone is a refusal rather than a pass.

Exits non-zero when an occurrence appears that the baseline does not name.
Known pre-existing occurrences live in the sidecar baseline, each with a
one-line reason.  A reason that is empty, or that still starts with ``TODO``
or ``UNREVIEWED``, does not suppress anything -- baselining is a decision
somebody has to write down.
