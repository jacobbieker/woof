"""Delayed-window multi-storm scorecard: many cases, one accurate table.

Every skill number WaH has published so far comes from one storm.  The
caveat "N=1" sits on every claim, and wall clock is why: a live case
cannot be graded until reality arrives, so cases accumulate at one per
night of storms somebody watched.

This harness removes the wall clock.  A front-door run whose
``--window-end`` sits ~90+ minutes in the past is *scientifically
identical* to a live run -- the live chunk feed assembles to the very
bytes the archive stores (``evidence/da-demo/live-feed/paired-run-1.json``:
volume sha256 equal across the live-chunk and archive feeds) -- but every
verification frame already exists, so the full grade is available the
moment the free forecast finishes.  Skill measurement becomes
compute-bound: one card-night is a ten-case scorecard.

Four subcommands, receipts at every stage:

    discover   survey the archive over a date range for qualifying
               convective events -- (site, window) pairs found by the
               front door's own echo census, ranked, and deduplicated so
               one long-lived system does not count five times.
               Selection is BLIND TO SKILL by construction: nothing in
               it looks at a forecast.  Every coverage cap it applies
               -- the census limit, ``--max-cases`` -- is recorded WITH
               the cases it removed, because a cap that keeps the
               largest storms and does not say so is a selection nobody
               can audit.
    plan       freeze a campaign: the discovery's cases, one frozen
               front-door configuration, its hash, and cost estimates.
    run        drive the EXISTING front door end to end per case
               (prepare, obs ladder, cycles, free forecast, one-shot
               verification, scorer of record), sequentially, behind
               the same GPU admission gate every queue on this card
               polls.  Failures are recorded and skipped, never
               silently retried.  Every PLANNED case gets an outcome,
               so a campaign the card never freed for says what it did
               not cover instead of shrinking its own denominator, and
               the delayed-window floor is re-checked HERE, where the
               card is actually taken.  Designed to live inside a
               detached scheduled task (harness tasks die at 60 min).
    scorecard  aggregate across cases: per-lead FSS distributions
               (median/IQR, not just the mean), column-count bias,
               control-relative skill, structure metrics where the
               scorer of record provides them, and a per-case table so
               outliers stay visible.  One receipt JSON plus one summary
               figure, written into the campaign directory.

Discovery is two passes so the archive is not bulk-downloaded:

    pass 1  payload-free: ``rw_nexrad list`` per site per day.  A run of
            volumes at precipitation-VCP cadence and precipitation-sized
            volumes marks a *candidate* window.  This is a PREFILTER and
            the receipt says so; volume size never qualifies a case.
    pass 2  the qualifying test: sample volumes from each candidate are
            fetched and decoded through the same seam the front door
            surveys with, and the case qualifies on the front door's own
            echo census (``tools.da_nowcast.echo_stats``) -- gates at or
            above the reflectivity threshold on the low sweeps.

The site roster comes from ``rw_nexrad sites`` (the vendored table) or
from ``--sites``.  No radar-site name belongs in this file, its
defaults, or its identifiers (standing owner rule).

ACCURACY: the campaign receipt and the summary figure both carry the
configuration hash, the case count, and the full selection criteria, so
nobody can be accused of cherry-picking after the fact -- and both are
labeled demo-grade, because every tool this drives is.
