"""A nowcast that keeps going: one site, one gallery, no further command.

``python -m tools.da_nowcast_auto start --site XXXX --out DIR`` launches
a detached daemon that, from then on, does by itself what
:mod:`tools.da_nowcast` does once:

    bootstrap   the front door up to its georeference forecast
                (``da_nowcast run --stop-after forecast``): survey,
                domain, fetch, prepare, forecast.  ONE prepared case per
                epoch, and that case's boundary data is what bounds the
                epoch.
    catch up    assimilate every volume between the model's init hour
                and now, oldest first -- a real spin-up on real data
                rather than an hour of free integration
    cycle       once current, take each new volume as it lands, on the
                radar's own rhythm (4-6 minutes in a precipitation VCP,
                not a 15-minute clock)
    forecast    refresh the free legs from the newest analysis
    render      redraw the gallery IN PLACE at one stable path

and then waits.  Refreshing that one page is the whole user experience.

**The ensemble is alive across cycles.**  Each cycle resumes the
generation the last one wrote (:mod:`tools.da_ensemble_state`) and
writes its own, so the covariance is the one the cycling built, not a
fresh perturbation every few minutes.  Free legs branch off that state
and never become it.

**The free forecast refreshes when the analysis is current.**  While the
daemon is still catching up, a 90-minute forecast off a state that is
about to be superseded by the next volume is work nobody will look at;
those cycles run observations only, and the gallery says which mode it
is in.

**Accurate degradation, out loud.**  A late volume, a skipped cycle, a
failed stage: each is written into the status file AND stamped on the
gallery page through ``auto-notice.json``.  Nothing is padded, no volume
is re-used as a new one, and the model is never advanced past data it
does not have.

**Epochs end.**  A prepared case carries a finite window of lateral
boundary data.  Approaching it, the daemon says so, boots a new epoch on
a newer background and re-initialises the ensemble -- a generation
written against one prepared case cannot be restored into another, and
the identity check exists to stop anyone pretending otherwise.

**Backgrounds age (EXPERIMENTAL: overlap handover, default OFF).**  A
daemon left running holds one prepared case until its boundary data is
spent, so its background gets older by the hour while the analysis stays
current.  Currency is the whole point of this nowcast, so
``--background-max-age`` opts into the conservative fix: past that age
the daemon prepares a SECOND case from the newest available cycle, spins
a second ensemble up on it by assimilating the same volumes the first one
is assimilating, and once that ensemble has ``--spinup-cycles`` cycles
behind it the gallery and the free forecast switch to it and the old
ensemble is retired -- its state left on disk, nothing deleted.

No state crosses cases and no identity semantics move: the fresh
ensemble is initialised on the fresh case and cycled up from scratch,
exactly as a bootstrap is.  What it costs is transient double compute
during the overlap, and the spin-up lane pays the cheaper half of it --
it runs observations only, never a free forecast, because nobody is
looking at its forecast until it becomes the primary.  Both lanes'
cycles are ordinary child processes run one at a time from this one
loop, so the card sees the same one-run-at-a-time admission it always
has; the spin-up mostly fills the primary's idle time between volumes.

If the fresh case fails to prepare, or its spin-up fails, the daemon
retires the attempt, says so on the gallery, waits out a cooldown and
goes on cycling the old ensemble.  A fresher background is never worth
killing a working nowcast for.

**Runs and commits belong in different worktrees.**  This daemon
fingerprints the run root's git HEAD at start and stops -- loudly, case
and gallery intact -- if it moves.  Point ``--run-root`` at a worktree
nobody commits into.

Site ids are arguments here as everywhere: no station name belongs in
this file, its defaults or its identifiers (standing owner rule).

ACCURACY: demo-grade nowcast.  UNSCORED, outside any registered campaign,
EXPERIMENTAL like every tool it drives.  No skill claim is made or
implied; the gallery says so on every figure.
