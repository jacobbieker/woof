"""The cycling ensemble, written down between processes.

:mod:`tools.da_cycle_prepared` joins one leg to the next through the
restart owner, :mod:`woof.io.restart`: at the end of a leg every
trajectory writes a complete tree checkpoint set (every domain it
carries: the atmosphere, the physics driver's surface and soil state,
the precipitation accumulators, the held tendencies and the clocks),
and the next leg restores that set into a freshly wired model before
it applies the analysis.  That state lives for exactly as long as the
process does, which is why a run has always had to declare every cycle
up front.

A continuous nowcast cannot: the next observation does not exist yet
when this one is assimilated.  This module is the leg boundary written
to disk, so the SAME state that survives a leg inside one process
survives the gap between two.  Nothing here is a second ensemble
representation -- a generation holds the driver's own restart sets,
copied member for member, plus the driver's own ``pending`` mapping in
the driver's own ``np.savez`` form.

**What a generation holds.**  For every trajectory (the never-analysed
control and each member): its post-leg restart set, and the increments
the analysis at that leg produced and the NEXT leg has still to apply.
Both are required.  A generation with the restart set alone would
silently drop one cycle's analysis -- the model would advance from a
background nobody corrected, and no error would be raised anywhere.

**Identity is checked, not assumed.**  A generation is only meaningful
against the same prepared case, physics profile, grid, timestep and
ensemble size that produced it.  :func:`validate_resume` compares every
one of those and refuses with the full list of what differs, because
restoring a 49-level checkpoint into a 51-level state is the kind of
mistake that produces plausible-looking output.  The restart owner
then checks the rest -- configuration, base state, physics setup --
member by member when the set is restored.

**Slots, not an ever-growing pile.**  Generations are written into a
small ring of slot directories (see :func:`slot_dir`) so a daemon
cycling for hours overwrites its own working state instead of
accumulating one full ensemble copy every few minutes.  Two slots is the
minimum that is crash-safe: the generation being written is never the
generation being resumed from.

Writes are atomic per file: a reader that catches a half-written
generation would restore a torn state, and the manifest is written LAST,
so a generation without a readable manifest is a generation that was
never finished.
