"""Recapture an advection oracle GPU receipt on this card, compare it word

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS
--------------------------
Every receipt pins the assembled kernel source it was measured at
(``kernels.advection``, ``kernels.pd_advection``, ``kernels.openbc``), so a
kernel edit leaves each receipt red until a capture on its card reproduces
its words.  The vertical-order lane (286-vadv5) left the H100 receipt of the
WRF 4.7.1 fixture behind that way (b70a94a48): no lane can reach an sm_90
card.  Byte identity is certified on Blackwell and newer only (ruling
2026-10-04), so an older card's receipt that trails the tree is reported,
not failed, and the index's ``uncertified_stale`` record names the commit
that staled it; installing that receipt again drops the record.  The
HRRR-fork fixture has no sm_100 receipt at all, so its device tests assert a
coverage gap there.  Moving a receipt by hand on a rented box is
exactly where a receipt gets words that were never measured, or a
production change on that architecture gets recorded as the new truth.
This tool is the one procedure for that move:

1. it copies the fixture's inputs and references into ``--scratch`` (the
   validator writes word archives inside the directory it measures, and the
   checkout must not change before the comparison);
2. it runs ``validate_advect_oracle.py --gpu --controls --mutation`` there,
   with the WRF-exact switches removed so the default compile is measured;
3. it compares the capture with the receipt this card selects through the
   fixture's ``gpu-receipts.json``: every case's measurement rows and level
   rows (each carries the SHA-256 of the words it measured) and, where the
   committed folder stores the archive, every float32 word;
4. it writes a record of all of that, and with ``--install`` moves the
   receipt, the stored archives, the fixture's checksum lines and the index
   ONLY if every production word reproduced (or the card has no receipt).

A production word that moved is a finding, not a recapture: the tool exits
1, installs nothing, and the record names every differing case and count.

Modes, by what ``gpu-receipts.json`` says about this card:

``card``          the card has its own receipt: production must reproduce;
                  controls may move (they are text-patched compiles whose
                  multiply-add fusion follows unrelated source edits) and
                  are re-recorded from the capture.
``architecture``  another card's receipt of the same compute capability:
                  installing moves that receipt's pins only if production
                  AND every control reproduced (the RTX 5070 Ti precedent in
                  README.md); otherwise ``--as-card`` records this card's own.
``first``         nothing recorded for the card or its architecture: the
                  capture becomes ``gpu-receipt-sm<MM>.json`` with every
                  variant's archives in ``gpu-words-sm<MM>``, and the index
                  maps the card and, if unmapped, its architecture.

Exit status: 0 reproduced (or a first capture), 1 production differs,
2 install refused, 3 capture failed.
