"""Measure the physics composition space by walking it through the loader.

The question this answers is "is woof's physics hardcoded" -- can a user
compose microphysics, PBL, surface layer, land surface, radiation, cumulus
and turbulence freely, or does some engine lock pin them to the shipped
named suites?  It is answered by MEASUREMENT, not by reading code: every
combination below is written into a real experiment TOML and pushed
through :func:`woof.experiment.build_experiment` -- the one front door
``woof run``, ``woof go``, ``woof check``, both prepared runners and the
DA drivers reach the per-domain ``RunConfig`` through -- and the verdict
recorded is whatever that call did.

ACCEPTED means the loader returned an experiment AND the resolved
per-domain RunConfig carries every selector the file asked for, value for
value (an "accepted" that quietly rewrote a switch would be an engine lock
wearing a disguise, so preservation is checked on every accepted row and
any mismatch is a hard error here).  REFUSED records the refusal's own
message, verbatim.

The receipt asserts nothing.  ``tests/test_physics_composition_walk.py``
regenerates it, compares byte for byte, and pins the properties.
