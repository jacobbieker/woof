"""A/B one LETKF analysis between solve devices, on identical inputs.

WHY THIS EXISTS.  ``tools/da_cycle_prepared.py`` defaults ``--solve-device``
to ``host``, so a bare cycling run analyses with numpy while a purpose-built
device eigensolver (:mod:`woof.core.jacobi_eigh`) sits behind an opt-in
flag.  Committed cycle reports put the analysis at 1317 to 1477 seconds a
leg against an 8434-second cycle -- 65% of the wall clock -- so the choice of
default is the single largest scheduling decision in the DA path.  Changing
a default on that evidence alone would be changing it on an *inference*: no
receipt on disk holds the same leg solved both ways, and the reports that
measure the host arm were produced by driver scripts that hard-coded
``solve_device="host"`` and never ran the other one.  This tool produces the
missing measurement.

WHAT IT MEASURES, and why each part is here.

* **Wall per stage, both arms.**  ``woof.da.letkf.analyze`` now splits its
  own clock three ways (setup, chunk loop, finish) and
  ``assimilate_radar_grid`` records the device arm's staging and unstaging
  separately.  The split matters because the two arms can differ for
  opposite reasons: the localisation weighting of phase 1 runs at EVERY
  gridpoint while the eigensolve runs only at the active ones, so on a
  radar-sparse domain a device arm can win the solve and still lose the
  leg to a transfer.  A single wall number cannot tell those apart.

* **Analysis-field deltas.**  Per field, max-abs and max-rel between the
  two arms' increments, plus the same statistics against the ensemble-mean
  increment magnitude, so "agrees to rounding" is a measured claim and not
  a hope.  The two arms are NOT expected to agree bitwise -- different
  eigensolvers, different summation orders -- and this is where that is
  quantified rather than assumed.

* **GPU contention, both interleavings.**  During a real DA cycle the card
  is integrating the ensemble.  A device analysis therefore does not get an
  idle GPU, and the accurate question is not "which arm is faster alone" but
  "which arrangement finishes the leg sooner".  ``--interleave`` measures
  both: ``serial`` runs the ensemble-shaped load to completion and then the
  analysis (what a cycle does today), ``concurrent`` runs them together
  (what a host analysis makes possible, and what a device analysis has to
  share a card for).  The load is work-conserving across interleavings --
  the same iteration count either way -- so the two totals are comparable.

WHAT IT REFUSES TO PRETEND.  A bundle records whether it is ``real`` (the
analysis inputs of an actual DA leg, dumped by
``tools/da_cycle_prepared.py --dump-analysis-bundle``) or ``synthetic``
(built here from a twin-experiment construction).  That word is copied into
every receipt and into the verdict line.  A synthetic bundle proves the
instrument works and gives a shape-comparable ratio; it does not settle a
default, and the receipt says so in words.

USAGE

    # 1. get a bundle.  From a real leg, in the DA driver:
    #      tools/da_cycle_prepared.py ... --dump-analysis-bundle DIR
    #    or build one here, for instrument checks and shape studies:
    python -m tools.da_solve_ab make-bundle --out BUNDLE \\
        --nz 6 --ny 40 --nx 40 --members 10 --radars 2

    # 2. run the A/B
    python -m tools.da_solve_ab run --bundle BUNDLE --out receipt.json \\
        --device host --device cuda --repeat 3 \\
        --interleave alone --interleave serial --interleave concurrent

Every arm runs in a FRESH SUBPROCESS.  That is not tidiness: a device
context created by one arm changes what the next arm's allocator and the
chunk sizer see, and the sizer reads the card's free memory.  Two arms in
one process do not measure two arms.
