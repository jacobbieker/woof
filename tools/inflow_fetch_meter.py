"""Measure how far downstream of a laminar nest inflow boundary a child
domain's resolved turbulence takes to reach its interior value.

THE QUESTION.  A one-way LES child receives smoothed parent fields through
its specified/relaxation boundary.  Nothing perturbs that inflow, so the
air entering the child carries the parent's resolved scales and none of the
child's own.  It has to grow them, and it grows them while being advected,
so the spin-up is a DISTANCE, not only a time.  This module measures that
distance on an already-integrated tree.  It creates no turbulence, changes
no model code, and is deliberately usable on any one-way child whose parent
diagnoses a boundary-layer depth.

THE METRIC, stated before any data was read.

1.  *Where.*  One mass level per frame: the level whose column-mean height
    AGL is nearest ``0.5 * PBLH``, with PBLH taken from the PARENT over the
    child's own footprint.  A PBL-off child writes ``PBLH`` identically
    zero, so reading depth from the child is a silent factor-of-two error
    on exactly this kind of score; the parent-PBLH rule is the correction
    that receipt recorded.

2.  *Which faces are inflow.*  WRF's ``flow_dep_bdy`` convention, read off
    ``woof/ingest/lateral_bc.py`` (``_apply_flow_dependent_boundary_generic``):
    a face is OUTflow where the boundary-normal flux leaves the domain, so
    inflow is ``u > 0`` on west, ``u < 0`` on east, ``v > 0`` on south and
    ``v < 0`` on north.  The wind is the PARENT's, on the child's footprint,
    at the same mid-CBL level, averaged along the face.  Faces are ranked by
    inward normal wind speed; the strongest is the dominant inflow face.

3.  *The fetch coordinate.*  Distance measured perpendicular to an inflow
    face, in child cells, converted to km.  A column is assigned to a face
    only where that face is its NEAREST inflow face, so two inflow faces
    never both claim the same corner.  The profile at distance ``d`` is the
    statistic over every claimed column at that distance.

4.  *The two statistics per strip.*  Both are computed on the child's
    vertical velocity at the mid-CBL level.
      A. ``var(w)`` over the strip's claimed columns.
      B. Child-band spectral energy: the strip's 1-D power spectrum along
         the face-parallel direction, Parseval-normalised so the bins sum
         to the strip variance, integrated over wavelengths between the
         CHILD's 7dx and the PARENT's 7dx.  That band is the one the
         refinement is supposed to add and the parent cannot carry, so it
         isolates newly generated scales from inherited ones.

5.  ``D90``.  The plateau ``P`` is the median of the profile over the
    interior window ``[0.75, 0.95] * D_max``, where ``D_max`` is the
    face-normal extent less the boundary zone at the far side.  The profile
    is smoothed by an 11-strip running median (2.75 km at 250 m, roughly one
    energy-containing eddy) and ``D90`` is the SMALLEST distance at which
    the smoothed profile reaches ``0.9 * P`` and then HOLDS above it for at
    least 5 km.  A first touch is not enough -- a strip variance built from
    a few hundred samples has several per cent of noise and would let one
    blip declare spin-up complete -- and "above for the whole remaining
    domain" is too strict for the same reason in the other direction.  If no
    such distance exists inside the domain the result is recorded as NOT
    REACHED with the domain extent as a lower bound; that outcome is a
    finding, not a failure of the meter.  These three constants were fixed
    against synthetic fields with known ramps (``tests/test_inflow_fetch_meter.py``)
    before the meter was pointed at any model output.

6.  *Normalisation.*  ``D90`` is reported in km, in units of the parent
    ``PBLH`` (z_i) for comparison with the boundary-layer literature, and
    with the along-flow correction ``D90 / cos(theta)`` where ``theta`` is
    the angle between the mean mid-CBL wind and the face normal -- the
    normal distance understates the distance actually travelled whenever
    the flow is oblique to the face.

7.  *The consequence for a whole-domain score.*  A score that averages over
    the entire child averages the fetch zone in with the interior.  So the
    meter also reports, per frame: the fraction of the child's area lying
    inside the fetch zone (nearer than ``D90`` to its nearest inflow face,
    with ``D90`` from the var(w) metric on that column's own face), the
    child's mid-CBL ``var(w)`` over the whole domain and over the interior
    alone, the parent's ``var(w)`` over the matching ground in both cases,
    and the two child/parent ratios.  The difference between those ratios
    is the size of the contamination, measured rather than argued.
