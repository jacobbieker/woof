"""Generate WRF v4.6.1 em_les namelists for the WP-L7 oracle.

Three families:
  stock  - the shipped test/em_les configuration, unmodified (native oracle)
  match  - matched to the WOOF idealized CBL case
           (woof/verify/cases/convective_boundary_layer.py)
  moist  - P1: the same two families with microphysics ON.  ``mp_physics`` is
           a per-run parameter here rather than the hard-coded 0 it used to
           be, and the sounding and iofields file travel with the run so a
           moist arm is a fully enumerated delta rather than an edit.

Every deviation from the stock em_les namelist is enumerated in the
matched-config receipt written alongside the runs.

**Dry byte-compatibility is a property of this file, not a hope.** The five
original run ids emit namelists byte-identical to the committed
``namelist.stock_em_les`` / ``namelist.match_*``; `--check-dry` proves it
against this directory before anything else is generated.
