# Toolchain-robustness arm for the em_les oracle.
#
# Framing matters here. gfortran seeds random_number from OS entropy when
# RANDOM_SEED is never called, and WRF's ideal case never calls it, so two
# em_les runs of one configuration on one node with one binary are already
# different realisations. That is proven, not assumed: on a development machine two
# identical-config runs differ by 4.27 percent in the entrainment minimum.
# It is therefore IMPOSSIBLE to isolate a compiler-flag effect from
# realisation noise with a single pair of runs.
#
# The answerable question is whether the -fno-tree-vectorize build lands
# inside the realisation spread already measured for the vectorised build.
# If it does, the flag effect on the reported statistics is smaller than the
# noise those statistics already carry, which is the accurate and sufficient
# result for a chaotic LES.
