"""Write ``docs/public/CLI-OPTIONS.md`` from the parsers themselves.

The complete option surface of every documented door, in one page, built
by reading the argparse parsers rather than by remembering to write a
line.  ``tests/test_docs_extras_agree_with_code.py`` holds the committed
page against those same parsers in both directions, so the page cannot
silently fall behind the code and cannot name a flag the code dropped.

Run it after changing any CLI option::

    python -m tools.build_cli_options_doc

It rewrites the generated half of the page and leaves the hand-written
notes above each table alone -- those are keyed by door name in
:data:`NOTES` here, which is version-controlled prose, not scraped text.
