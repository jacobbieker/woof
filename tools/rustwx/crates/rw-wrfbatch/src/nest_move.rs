//! A moving nest's earlier frames, re-indexed onto the nest's latest place.
//!
//! A following nest moves by whole parent cells, and every history frame
//! records where it sat: WRF's `I_PARENT_START`, `J_PARENT_START` and
//! `PARENT_GRID_RATIO` global attributes, which gpuwm's history writer
//! refreshes after every move (`gpuwm/runtime.py`, the post-move seam).  Two
//! frames of one nest at different places therefore share every cell of
//! their overlap exactly, a whole number of nest cells apart, with no
//! interpolation between them.
//!
//! A store holds one grid, so a series that spans a move used to be split
//! into one store per place (`gpuwm/render.py`'s series grouping keys on the
//! placement and the coordinates), and a window whose earlier frame sat at
//! the old place had nothing to difference: the 1 h rain of a 3 km storm-
//! following nest was drawn only at the hours in which the nest did not move
//! (4 of 12 on a live tropical storm), and the render step ended failed.
//!
//! Here an earlier frame is moved onto the grid of the series' LAST frame
//! (the frame the pictures are drawn for) by the move the two frames record:
//! the cell that sits on the same ground takes its value, and a cell the
//! earlier place did not cover holds NaN, the store's missing value.  A
//! window folded from it is missing there for that window, never zero and
//! never borrowed from a neighbour.  The move is checked against the frames'
//! own coordinates on the whole overlap before any value is taken.
