//! Native reader for `gpuwm-obs.radar-grid` v1 and v2 -- gridded radar
//! observations on a model mass grid.
//!
//! **Why this is a reader and not a writer.**  Every other input gap this
//! workspace had was closed by writing a wrfout, because the producer held
//! a full model state and a wrfout is the accurate container for one.  This
//! file is the exception in both directions: it is ALREADY classic NetCDF
//! carrying `XLAT`/`XLONG` on the model mass grid, so there is nothing to
//! convert; and wrapping observations in a wrfout would make the renderer's
//! `TitleProvenance::LocalImport` declare that a model produced them.  A
//! plot that attributes radar returns to a forecast is worse than no plot.
//!
//! What is read (schema: `gpuwm/obs/radar_grid.py`):
//!
//! | variable | dims | meaning |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `XLAT`, `XLONG` | `(south_north, west_east)` | model mass grid |
//! | `z_obs`, `z_mask` | `(level, south_north, west_east)` | reflectivity and its validity |
//! | `vr_obs`, `vr_mask` | v1 `(radar, level, south_north, west_east)`, v2 `(radar, level, window_j, window_i)` | radial velocity per radar |
//! | `radar_j0`, `radar_i0`, `radar_nj`, `radar_ni` | `(radar,)`, v2 only | each radar's window in domain cells |
//! | `radar_lat`, `radar_lon` | `(radar,)` | site positions |
//! | `radar_id` | `(radar, nchar)` | site identifiers |
//!
//! A mask is `int8`, nonzero where the cell carries an observation.  The
//! masks are essential: `z_obs` is dense and its unobserved cells hold a
//! fill value, so a reduction that ignores `z_mask` maps the fill onto the
//! colour table and paints observations where the radars saw nothing.
//!
//! **The two layouts, and why the window is not expanded on read.**  v1
//! stores every radar's velocity over the whole domain; v2 stores it over
//! that radar's own reach window and carries the window origin and extent
//! beside it.  Reflectivity is NOT windowed in either -- it merges across
//! radars into one field -- so only the velocity axis differs.
//!
//! Expanding a v2 window back to the whole domain at load time would read
//! identically here and would defeat the entire point of the layout: an
//! all-radar CONUS file holds ~150 sites, and the whole-domain form of its
//! velocity volumes is terabytes where the windowed form is gigabytes.
//! So the stored layout is kept and the consumers below index THROUGH the
//! window, with v1 read as the degenerate case in which every radar's
//! window is the whole domain.  That is the same reduction the Python
//! reader makes (`gpuwm/obs/radar_grid.py`, which synthesises
//! `radar_windows = [[0, ny-1, 0, nx-1], ...]` for a v1 file), so neither
//! side branches on the schema below the point where it is read.
