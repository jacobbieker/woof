//! `xsec:` products: vertical cross-sections through NATIVE-LEVEL wrfout
//! fields along a great-circle line, drawn by `rustwx-cross-section`.
//!
//! The store keeps 2-D planes and five isobaric sounding volumes; it has no
//! hydrometeors, no vertical velocity and no scalar the model carries only
//! on its own eta levels.  So this family does not go through the store at
//! all: it opens the wrfout files a second time with `wrf-core`, samples
//! the requested 3-D fields at the section's columns (bilinear in grid
//! space), puts every column onto one height ladder (linear in z) and
//! hands the crate a `ScalarSection` with a terrain profile.
//!
//! ## Product grammar
//!
//! ```text
//! xsec:[<alias>:]<fill>[/<overlay>[/<overlay>...]]
//! <term> := <name>['+'<name>...]['@cold']['~log']['='<l1>,<l2>,...['@'<highlight>]]
//! ```
//!
//! * `<name>` is any `wrf-core` `getvar` name (`tk`, `wa`, `height`, `rh`,
//!   ...) or a raw 3-D wrfout variable (`QCLOUD`, `QICE`, `TR17_1`, ...);
//!   `+` sums the named fields, which is how a family of tracers becomes
//!   one fill without a per-case code path.
//! * `@cold` keeps the term only where the temperature is below 0 C
//!   (supercooled liquid is `QCLOUD@cold`); `~log` draws the fill as
//!   `log10` with zeros transparent, for quantities that span decades.
//! * `=l1,l2,...` fixes an overlay's contour levels, `@h` after them
//!   highlights one of them; absent, the levels are chosen from the
//!   field's own range (and by name for the common ones).  On the fill
//!   term the list names the colour bar's range, lowest level to highest
//!   (`QCLOUD=0.01,0.1` draws every frame on 0.01 to 0.1 g kg-1), which
//!   is how a series of cuts is put on one bar.
//! * `<alias>` names the output slug (`xsec_<alias>`), so a long tracer
//!   sum still files under a readable product folder.
//!
//! Mixing ratios (`Q*`, not `QN*`) are shown in g kg-1; everything else in
//! the units `getvar` reports.  Isotherms come from `tk` and are drawn on
//! every section (`--isotherms`), with the highlighted one in the theme's
//! attention ink.
//!
//! The section line comes from `--section lat,lon,lat,lon` or
//! `--section FILE.json` (`{"start": [lat, lon], "end": [lat, lon]}` or a
//! polyline `{"points": [[lat, lon], ...], "extend_km": 20}` whose first
//! and last points are the line, extended by `extend_km` past each end).
//! Every PNG is named the way the batch lane names its panels, so the
//! Python placement files it under `<domain>/xsec_<slug>/<valid-day>/`.
