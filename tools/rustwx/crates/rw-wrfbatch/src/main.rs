//! Headless raw-WRF import plus production Rusty Weather batch rendering.
//!
//! This intentionally reuses the UI crate's hardened WRF processing modules;
//! it only replaces the egui orchestration with a bounded command-line job.
//!
//! gpuwm adaptations over the source workspace's rw_wrf_batch bin:
//! every stored frame renders by default (`--frames all`), a single frame
//! is selectable by stored slot (`--frames N`), and the work limits are
//! sized to the request instead of the GUI's one-hour click ceilings --
//! which is what lets exact-time (sub-hourly) imports render every frame.
//!
//! It also stamps the run's own identity onto every output.  The upstream
//! filename carried model, init cycle, forecast hour, and the generic
//! `native_grid` slug -- which is identical for every nest of one run, so
//! rendering two domains at one lead into one directory silently
//! overwrote one forecast with the other.  The inputs' `GRID_ID` and `DX`
//! become a `d02-3km` domain token in the slug position, and the same
//! spacing appears as `Δx 3 km` in the plot subtitle.  Provenance is the
//! local model (`--source-label`, default `ArWen`) rather than the GDEX
//! source inherited from the `wrf` store-model identity.
