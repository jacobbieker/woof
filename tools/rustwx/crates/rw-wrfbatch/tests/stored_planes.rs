//! The generic `var:<name>` product has to be able to name a 2-D plane a
//! USER added to their wrfout.
//!
//! The concrete breakage these tests prevent: `rw_wrfbatch` imports every
//! wrfout through the full science route (`wrf_process`), and that route
//! only ever wrote the fields its two fixed catalogs name: the wrf-core
//! diagnostic registry and `RAW_EXTRA_CATALOG`. A plane the file carries
//! but no catalog knows about was silently dropped at import, so
//! `--products var:wrf_<name>` refused with
//! `stored 2-D variable "wrf_<name>" does not exist` and the user's own
//! Registry output was unreachable through the renderer. Adding a product
//! per user variable is exactly the per-model-adapter shape the arbitrary
//! acceptance test forbids; ingesting every stored `(Time, south_north,
//! west_east)` plane is metadata-level and costs no new product code.
