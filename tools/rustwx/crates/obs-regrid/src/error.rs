//! The error taxonomy, seeded from `rustwx-regrid::error` in the project's
//! consolidated Rust (`crates/rustwx-regrid/src/error.rs`): the same
//! four failure classes, because they are the same four things that can
//! be wrong with a remap request.  `UnsupportedGeometry` is dropped --
//! this engine takes lat/lon arrays directly rather than a geometry
//! trait object, so there is no geometry that can decline to expose a
//! centre.
