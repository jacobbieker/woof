//! A 3-D k-d tree whose nearest-neighbour answer is DEFINED, not
//! whatever a traversal order happened to reach first.
//!
//! This replaces `scipy.spatial.cKDTree.query(k=1,
//! distance_upper_bound=...)` on the observation battery's remap plan.
//! Two halves of scipy's behaviour are reproduced exactly because they
//! are specified by the arithmetic, and one is deliberately NOT
//! reproduced because scipy leaves it unspecified:
//!
//! **Reproduced: the metric.**  scipy accumulates the squared distance
//! as `dx*dx + dy*dy + dz*dz` in that dimension order and returns
//! `sqrt` of it.  Measured bit-identical over 200 000 random unit-sphere
//! pairs (`golden/gen_regrid_goldens.py`, probe `distance_formula`).
//!
//! **Reproduced: the bound.**  scipy squares `distance_upper_bound` and
//! accepts a candidate on the STRICT predicate `d2 < bound*bound`.  Both
//! halves matter: comparing `d < bound` instead disagrees with scipy on
//! points within one ULP of the bound (measured: 2060 disagreements in
//! 12 000 boundary trials, scipy agreeing with the squared form every
//! time), and using `<=` disagrees on the exact-equality case (measured:
//! 300 of 300 exact-equality trials rejected by scipy).
//!
//! **NOT reproduced: the tie.**  When two source points are exactly
//! equidistant, scipy returns whichever the tree traversal reached
//! first.  Measured over 400 duplicate-source trials it returned the
//! lowest flat index 232 times and some other tied index 168 times, and
//! over 400 mirror-symmetric trials 268 / 132.  There is no rule there
//! to be bit-exact to.  This tree defines the answer instead: **among
//! exactly tied candidates the lowest flat source index wins.**  The
//! concrete breakage that rule prevents is a plan whose integer mapping
//! is not a function of the two grids -- the battery's whole reason for
//! computing the plan once and reusing it across arms is that no score
//! may differ because a neighbour search broke a tie differently, and a
//! tie broken by traversal order is exactly that, one rebuild away.
//!
//! Pruning descends into a box whose lower-bound distance EQUALS the
//! best so far, rather than cutting on `>=`, because a tied candidate in
//! that box may carry a lower index.  Ties are rare enough that the cost
//! is not measurable and the rule is worth more than the cycles.

/// The best candidate found so far: `None` until something inside the
/// bound is seen.
