//! `rw_goes`: gpuwm's GOES ABI L2 cloud-product front door.
//!
//! The satellite twin of `rw_nexrad`, built to
//! `docs/obs-goes-cwp-bridge-design.md`.  A fail-closed CLI with three
//! jobs and no opinions beyond them (plus the Level 1b radiance family,
//! `bt` / `colocate` / `quicklook`, and the clear-sky forward operator
//! `forward`, documented in `radiance.rs` and `forward.rs`):
//!
//! * **acquire**: list and download ABI L2 cloud granules for a
//!   `(satellite, sector, product set, time window)` from the anonymous
//!   `noaa-goes{NN}` buckets, through the rw-sat content-addressed cache;
//! * **derive**: decode one scan's COD + CPS + ACTP trio through the
//!   patched `rw-sat` (DQF-gated, counts kept), refuse unless their fixed
//!   grids are bit-identical, and derive WoFS-style cloud water path;
//! * **pack**: write flat `GPWMGOES` packs that the Python obs layer
//!   reads with `json` + `numpy.frombuffer` and nothing else.
//!
//! It moves bytes, gates them by the numbers the algorithm published, and
//! reports facts.  It does **not** superob, regrid, or assign obs error:
//! those are the Python stage's.
//!
//! Two rules run through the whole thing, and both are refusals rather
//! than repairs.  A granule set that cannot be completed is a hard error
//! naming what is missing, never a partial pack.  Planes are only ever
//! combined across granules whose navigation is identical: combining
//! planes across two fixed grids would be fabrication, so it is refused
//! with the grids' own numbers in the message.
//!
//! That second rule has a measured consequence: at CONUS the CWP trio is
//! the 2 km grid (2500 x 1500) and ACHA/CTP are the 10 km grid (500 x 300),
//! so the vertical-placement fields get their OWN pack: `cloud-top`,
//! schema `gpuwm-obs.goes-cloudtop.v1`: paired to the CWP pack by
//! `(satellite, sector, scan_start)`.  Two packs per scan, deliberately;
//! see `cloudtop` for the ruling and the reason.
//!
//! In the payload, `NaN` means *no observation* and `0.0` means
//! *clear-sky zero*; nothing in this crate ever writes one for the other.

  verify     re-read any pack family and re-prove its header, schema and

two packs per scan, deliberately
  Measured on real GOES-19 CONUS granules: COD/CPS/ACTP are the 2 km fixed
  grid (2500 x 1500) and ACHA/CTP are the 10 km fixed grid (500 x 300) --
  same satellite, same sector, same scan start, same projection, different
  grid.  A pack's whole promise is that every plane in it is bit-identically
  on the grid it states, so `cwp` REFUSES a mixed-grid pack (naming both
  shapes) and the vertical-placement fields get their own pack instead.
  Upsampling cloud-top height to 2 km here would break the guarantee the
  format exists to make and would bury an interpolation choice in an ingest
  tool where no science reviewed it.  The join happens at the consumer,
  where the interpolation is explicit and recorded in that stage's receipt.
  Both packs carry the same (satellite, sector, scan_start) triple, which is
  the pairing key; `cloud-top --pairs-with` additionally pins the CWP pack's
  payload digest so the pairing can be proved rather than assumed.

acquisition options (list, fetch)
  --satellite ID        G16 / G17 / G18 / G19 (data, not a gate).  Selects the
                        anonymous open-data bucket noaa-goes{NN} unless
                        --bucket overrides it
  --sector TOKEN        C (CONUS), F (full disk), M1, M2.  NOAA publishes no
                        mesoscale COD or CTP, so a meso request naming either
                        is refused rather than silently listing nothing
  --products LIST       comma-separated family tokens: COD,CPS,ACTP and
                        optionally ACHA,CTP (also ACM).  Required: the product
                        set defines what makes a scan complete, so it is never
                        guessed
  --start TIME          window start, 2026-08-04T18:00:00Z or 20260804T180000
  --end TIME            window end (inclusive)
  --bucket NAME         override the satellite's open-data bucket
  --mode N              ABI scan mode token in the key prefix (default 6; 3 is
                        the contingency mode)

fetch options
  --cache DIR           object cache root (default: <out>/.cache, else
                        ./.rw-goes-cache).  Layout is rw-sat's:
                        <cache>/satellite/<bucket>/<key>
  --no-cache            always re-download, never read the cache
  --out DIR             also publish each granule here under its plain object
                        file name
  --limit-scans N       keep at most the first N complete scans in the window
  --complete-only       refuse the whole run if ANY scan in the window is
                        missing a requested product, naming the scan times and
                        the missing products.  Without it an incomplete scan is
                        reported and skipped, and only complete scans are ever
                        downloaded -- a half-fetched scan can never become a
                        pack, so it is not fetched

reading the DQF plane: index it over the WHOLE pack
  The `_dqf` planes are full-grid planes and must be indexed over every
  pixel of the pack, NEVER over the surviving-CWP mask.  The obs-error
  inflation factor is needed per pixel BEFORE superobbing decides which
  cells survive, so the two populations are different and are not
  interchangeable: on the measured CONUS scan 47,162 pixels have a NaN
  DQF (the flag itself was fill), and reading those as a bitfield gives
  garbage, silently -- `astype(np.uint16)` on a NaN does not raise.  Mask
  on `np.isfinite(dqf)` first, then read bits from the finite pixels.
  `dqf_missing` in the metadata is the count of exactly those pixels, so
  it is the number to check your mask against.

pairing a WINDOWED pack (nested campaigns)
  ORDER MATTERS, and it is the one thing worth not rediscovering:
    1.  rw_goes cwp       ... --window XS,XC,YS,YC --out nest.goespack
    2.  rw_goes cloud-top ... --pairs-with nest.goespack --out nest.cloudtop.goespack
  The sibling block can only pin a pack that already exists, so the
  windowed CWP pack is built first and the cloud-top points at it.  The
  cloud-top's sibling block then pins that window's digest and records
  its 2 km window, so the pairing is provable rather than asserted: a
  consumer hashes the CWP pack it holds and compares.  Pass the window
  you actually built -- a cloud-top whose sibling pins the full-sector
  pack will (correctly) not match a windowed one, because they are
  different packs with different digests.  A worked example with real
  digests is in docs/obs-goes-cwp-bridge-design.md.
  The cloud-top stays full-sector on purpose.  A 2 km window has no exact
  10 km counterpart in general -- 512 two-km columns is 102.4 ten-km
  columns -- so this tool will not round one into existence; that is the
  same silent resampling the two-pack split exists to prevent.  Window
  the cloud-top yourself with --window if you want a smaller one, and
  choose a box that covers your 2 km window; the pack records whichever
  window it was given, on its own grid.

per-pixel DQF planes (schema v2, 2026-08-06)
  Both packs carry one `<product>_dqf` plane per source granule -- cod_dqf,
  cps_dqf, actp_dqf (and acha_dqf / ctp_dqf in the cloud-top pack) -- holding
  the DQF exactly as published and UNGATED, appended after every v1 plane so
  no existing plane index moves.  `<f4` like every other plane, which is
  lossless for a u16 flag word (every integer below 2^24 is exact in f32);
  NaN means that DQF pixel was itself fill or out of range, never a stand-in
  for the real value 0.  Each `sources` row names its plane in `dqf_plane`,
  so a consumer looks the plane up rather than guessing the name.
  v1 carried only the DQF counts and the condemn mask.  Those are a summary:
  they say how many pixels each cause condemned, not which -- so the thin
  (256) and thick (512) DCOMP bits, which the condemn mask deliberately does
  NOT gate and which the CWP observation operator inflates obs error on,
  could not be recovered from a v1 pack at all.  The counts and the mask are
  unchanged and still there; the plane is what they could not answer.

cwp options (planes: cwp, phase, cod, cps, lat, lon, then the _dqf planes)
  --cod FILE            ABI-L2-COD granule (required)
  --cps FILE            ABI-L2-CPS granule (required)
  --actp FILE           ABI-L2-ACTP granule (required)
  --acha FILE           ABI-L2-ACHA granule.  Accepted, and refused with both
                        grid shapes wherever ACHA is not on the trio's grid --
                        which at CONUS it never is.  Use `cloud-top` instead
  --ctp FILE            ABI-L2-CTP granule; same rule as --acha
  --out FILE            pack destination (required)
  --window XS,XC,YS,YC  decode only this fixed-grid window (x start, x count,
                        y start, y count), the same window for every product.
                        Recorded in the pack so a consumer can place it back
                        on the full sector

cloud-top options (planes: cloud_top_height_m, cloud_top_pressure_hpa, lat,
                   lon, then the _dqf planes)
  --acha FILE           ABI-L2-ACHA granule; adds the cloud_top_height_m plane
  --ctp FILE            ABI-L2-CTP granule; adds the cloud_top_pressure_hpa
                        plane.  At least one of --acha / --ctp is required,
                        and given both they must share one scan and one grid
  --out FILE            pack destination (required)
  --pairs-with FILE     the `gpuwm-obs.goes-cwp.v1` pack of the same scan.
                        Its scan identity is checked against this one and
                        refused on any difference, and its payload digest is
                        recorded, so a consumer can prove the pairing
  --window XS,XC,YS,YC  window into THIS pack's grid.  Not comparable to a
                        --window index in the CWP sibling: the grids differ

DQF gating (both pack subcommands)
  Every granule is gated by its product's default DQF rule: enumerated
  (good is exactly DQF == 0) for ACHA/ACM/ACTP/CTP, and the measured DCOMP
  bitfield mask 88 (snow/sea-ice 8, twilight 16, sun glint 64, plus any
  fill DQF) for COD/CPS.  The rule name and the condemn mask are recorded
  per product in the pack, so how a pixel was gated is a value and not an
  inference.  The ice and mixed-phase CWP coefficients are PROVISIONAL and
  the pack says so.  Neither subcommand resamples anything.

bt options (planes: bt, rad, lat, lon, then bcm and cmip_bt when given, then
            the _dqf planes of every source)
  --rad FILE            ABI-L1b-Rad{C,F,M1,M2} granule (required); the band is
                        read from its name and every Planck constant from its
                        own planck_fk1/fk2/bc1/bc2 variables.  Brightness
                        temperature is the L1b product definition
                        T = (fk2 / ln(fk1 / Rad + 1) - bc1) / bc2; a pixel whose
                        DQF is not 0 (conditionally usable, out of range, no
                        value, focal-plane temperature) or whose radiance is not
                        positive is NaN plus a count, never a value
  --acm FILE            ABI-L2-ACM clear-sky mask of the SAME scan (BCM: 0 clear,
                        1 cloudy, DQF == 0), carried as the bcm plane
  --cmip FILE           ABI-L2-CMIP product of the same band and scan: NOAA's
                        own inversion of the same radiance, carried as cmip_bt
                        and compared pixel for pixel in the pack's cross_check
                        row (bias, rmse, max abs), a check on the arithmetic
                        above and never the scored quantity
  --received-utc ISO    when this system first held the radiance granule (the
                        fetch manifest's wall), recorded in the pack's provenance
                        row beside the granule's own date_created and id
  --band N              refuse unless the granule is this band
  --out FILE            pack destination (required)
  --window XS,XC,YS,YC  decode only this fixed-grid window, every file alike

forward options
  --columns FILE        the gpuwm-da.abi-columns.v2 stream of model columns
  --table FILE          the gpuwm-da.abi-fast-model.v1 coefficient table
  --out FILE            the gpuwm-da.abi-crtm.v1 output stream
  --emis-mode N         0: the table's surface emissivity by class (default);
                        1: the per-column emissivity the columns carry
  --bands LIST          ABI bands to evaluate, comma-separated (default: every
                        band in the table)
  --threads N           worker threads (default: the machine's parallelism)

colocate options
  --pack FILE           the gpuwm-obs.goes-bt.v1 pack (required)
  --sim PLANE           a simulated brightness-temperature plane: north-first
                        float32 little-endian, with a PLANE.json sidecar of
                        schema gpuwm-da.simsat-plane.v1 naming its shape, band,
                        exact ABI 2 km global-lattice crop (the SimSat
                        abi_fixed_grid_crop dictionary) and an optional u8
                        condensate mask plane; repeatable, tiles compose on the
                        lattice and an overlap keeps the first tile's pixel
  --block N             block side in lattice pixels for the block table
                        (default 24 = about 48 km at the sub-satellite point)
  --zenith-max DEG      drop pairs beyond this satellite zenith angle
  --out FILE            the block table CSV (required)
  --stats FILE          the pixel statistics JSON: per scene class (all,
                        obs_clear, obs_cloudy, sim_clear, sim_cloudy, both_clear,
                        both_cloudy, obs_clear_sim_cloudy, obs_cloudy_sim_clear)
                        per zenith band (all, le40, le60, le70): n, means, bias
                        (sim minus obs), rmse, the least-squares obs = a + b sim
                        fit and the rmse after it, the raw moments and a 1 K
                        difference histogram (required)
  Colocation is BY INDEX: the pack's scan angles are proven to sit on the
  (index + 1/2) * 56 urad lattice and pixel (I, J) of a tile is pixel (I, J) of
  the pack.  Nothing is interpolated, filled or resampled.

superobs options
  --pack FILE           the gpuwm-obs.goes-bt.v1 pack, built with --acm (required)
  --block N             block side in lattice pixels (default 24)
  --zenith-max DEG      drop pixels beyond this satellite zenith angle
  --out FILE            the observation-only block table CSV (required): per
                        block the clear pixels' mean and spread with the

                        the colocation table names them so one quality control
                        reads both; no simulated plane is involved
  --stats FILE          the record JSON (gpuwm-da.abi-superobs.v1), also printed

quicklook options
  --pack FILE --plane-name NAME   paint one plane of a pack (default bt)
  --sim PLANE ...       or compose simulated tiles on the lattice
  --band N              palette band (default: the pack's or the tile's)
  --bbox-index X0,X1,Y0,Y1  crop to these inclusive global lattice indices
  --downsample N        block-mean N x N finite pixels per output pixel
  --out FILE            PNG destination (required)

verify options
  --pack FILE           the pack to re-prove (--out is accepted too).  The
                        family is read from the pack's own schema, not from
                        its file name.  Reads every version this tool has
                        ever written -- v1 as well as v2 -- because a
                        receipt that names a pack's digest is worth nothing
                        once that pack can no longer be re-verified.  The
                        receipt reports `per_pixel_dqf`, false for a v1
                        pack: a fact about the version, not a fault
