//! Errors this decoder raises.
//!
//! The house convention (see `rw-glm`'s `RwlError` and `rustwx-io`'s
//! `IoError`) is that `Io` is reserved for genuine I/O and every structural
//! or semantic problem becomes a variant carrying the ODIM path and the
//! failing attribute name, so a refusal names the thing that failed rather
//! than merely the file.
//!
//! Every variant here is a *refusal*. This decoder has no "best effort" mode:
//! a polar volume whose geometry or sentinels cannot be read is not decoded
//! into plausible numbers, because a plausible-looking radial velocity field
//! is exactly the input that would be assimilated without anyone noticing.
