//! Why a gate in [`Moment::values`](crate::Moment::values) is not a number.
//!
//! ODIM_H5 reserves two raw storage values per moment, declared in
//! `/datasetN/dataM/what`, and they are **opposites**:
//!
//! * `undetect` -- the radar illuminated this gate and the return did not
//!   clear the detection threshold. That is a detection of *nothing*, which
//!   is a real observation of clear air and the thing every correct negative
//!   in a skill score is built from.
//! * `nodata` -- the radar did not measure this gate at all. It is evidence
//!   of nothing, and may well be hiding a storm.
//!
//! [`Moment::values`](crate::Moment::values) maps both to `f64::NAN`, because
//! a caller that only wants numbers should not have to know the vocabulary.
//! The *reason* is carried beside it in
//! [`Moment::censor`](crate::Moment::censor) instead -- one code per gate,
//! parallel to `values` and always the same length. That is the whole point
//! of this module: a consumer that needs the distinction can have it, and one
//! that does not is untouched, but the distinction is never *lost*.
//!
//! This mirrors `wx_radar::level2::censor`, which does the same job for
//! NEXRAD Message-31, and it deliberately shares that module's code space.
//!
//! # Why these particular numbers
//!
//! The two vocabularies are not the same, so the codes are chosen so that the
//! values which *mean* the same thing *are* the same, and the values which
//! mean different things are never confused:
//!
//! | code | this module | `wx_radar::level2::censor` | same meaning? |
//! |-----:|-------------|----------------------------|---------------|
//! | 0 | [`MEASURED`] | `MEASURED` | yes |
//! | 1 | [`UNDETECT`] | `BELOW_THRESHOLD` | yes -- both are "looked, found nothing" |
//! | 2 | *never minted* | `RANGE_FOLDED` | n/a -- ODIM has no such state |
//! | 3 | [`NOT_COLLECTED`] | `NOT_COLLECTED` | yes |
//! | 4 | [`NODATA`] | -- | ODIM-only |
//! | 5 | [`SENTINEL_AMBIGUOUS`] | -- | ODIM-only |
//!
//! Code 2 is the essential gap. NEXRAD's range-folded gate has no ODIM
//! counterpart, and ODIM's `nodata` is *not* range folding -- so `nodata`
//! takes a fresh code rather than borrowing 2. A consumer that reads both
//! planes with one table therefore cannot mistake a European unmeasured gate
//! for an American second-trip ambiguity. See [`RESERVED_RANGE_FOLDED`].
//!
//! The codes are `u8` and deliberately not a Rust `enum`: they are meant to
//! be transcribed verbatim into a `|u1` plane that crosses a file boundary
//! into an observation pack, and a numeric contract that crosses a file
//! boundary should be stated as numbers.
