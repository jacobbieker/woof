//! Assemble one polar volume out of the many single-sweep files that some
//! national feeds serve.
//!
//! The Netherlands and Romania publish one `PVOL` file per volume, and
//! [`read_volume`](crate::read_volume) is the whole story for them. Germany
//! does not: one Boostedt volume arrives as a **file per (elevation,
//! quantity) pair**: a `SCAN` object holding a single `/dataset1`. Measured
//! on the live feed 2026-08-14, that is **30 files** for one ten-elevation
//! volume, because it serves `TH` beside `DBZH` and `VRADH`, and they mean
//! nothing apart. Assembling them is not a convenience; without it the German
//! half of Europe is unreachable no matter how good the decoder is.
//!
//! # What could go wrong here, and what is done about it
//!
//! The failure this module exists to prevent is **a volume made of two
//! volumes**. Consecutive scans of the same radar produce files whose names
//! differ only in a timestamp; gluing a 0.5-degree cut from 12:00 to a
//! 1.5-degree cut from 12:05 yields a plausible object with a wrong wind
//! field five minutes out of date in half its columns, and nothing downstream
//! can see it. So the nominal time is the grouping key, it is read from
//! `/what/date` + `/what/time` **inside** each file rather than from its
//! name, and a group whose members disagree is refused rather than repaired.
//!
//! The second failure is **merging two antenna passes into one sweep**.
//! It is tempting to key a cut on its elevation, and it is wrong: a Dutch
//! volume carries three sweeps at 0.30 degrees with two different Nyquist
//! intervals, and split-cut strategies (a long-PRT reflectivity pass and a
//! short-PRT Doppler pass at the same angle) are ordinary radar practice.
//! Two files therefore merge into one [`Sweep`] only when they agree on the
//! **whole** cut identity: elevation, ray and bin counts, range scale, range
//! start, and the sweep's own start and end times, *and* their per-ray
//! azimuths match ray for ray. Anything less becomes two sweeps, which is the
//! accurate reading: they are two passes.
//!
//! That rule makes the merge ratio a measurement rather than an assumption.
//! Thirty files becoming ten sweeps says the feed records all three moments on
//! one antenna pass; thirty becoming thirty says it does not. Neither is
//! assumed here and [`AssembleReport`] reports which happened. Measured on the
//! real feed it is the first: 30 files, 10 sweeps, 20 merged.
