//! The ODIM quantity vocabulary.
//!
//! ODIM names its moments in `/datasetN/dataM/what/quantity` with a
//! vocabulary of its own -- `DBZH`, `VRADH`, `RHOHV` -- which does *not*
//! overlap NEXRAD's (`REF`, `VEL`, `RHO`). `wx_radar::products::RadarProduct`
//! only knows the NEXRAD spelling and answers `Unknown` for all of these, so
//! this crate carries its own table rather than mistranslating through that
//! one.
//!
//! The table exists mainly to answer two questions the assimilating side
//! actually asks: what unit is this in, and is it a velocity (and therefore
//! folded, and therefore in need of a Nyquist interval before it can be
//! used)?
//!
//! An unrecognised quantity is **not** an error. National writers ship vendor
//! quantities, and refusing a whole volume because one extra moment was not in
//! a hardcoded list would throw away the moments that were. Unknown quantities
//! decode normally and report [`QuantityKind::Other`] with an empty unit.
