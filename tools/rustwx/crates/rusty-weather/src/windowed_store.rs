//! Windowed products (multi-hour accumulations and extrema) computed FROM
//! THE STORE across per-hour `.rws` files, mirroring the GRIB windowed
//! lane's semantics (`rustwx_products::windowed` + `windowed_decoder`)
//! product for product:
//!
//! * QPF: `qpf_1h` and `qpf_total` read the trailing 1 h / run-total APCP
//!   accumulations the ingest stored from the anchor hour's sfc file
//!   (`apcp_1h`, `apcp_run_total`): the GRIB lane's "direct" strategy. The
//!   fixed trailing windows (`qpf_6h`/`12h`/`24h`) sum stored hourly
//!   `apcp_1h` increments, exactly the GRIB lane's HRRR path (HRRR never
//!   carries 6/12/24 h APCP messages, so that lane always summed hourly
//!   increments too). Millimeters fold first, inches out: the GRIB lane's
//!   conversion order. A store written by the wrfout import lane carries
//!   no hourly increment at all, only the run accumulation since
//!   simulation start, so the hourly windows fall back to differencing
//!   two stored run totals, naming both hours in the strategy note.
//! * 2-5 km UH: pointwise maxima of the stored sub-hourly 1 h max planes
//!   (`uh_2to5km_max_1h`, the native MXUPHL message selected at its window
//!   start hour), the exact field the GRIB windowed lane reduced. Hours
//!   ingested before the max field existed fall back to the stored hourly
//!   `uh_2to5km` plane, with the fallback hours named in the strategy
//!   note. (In current HRRR sfc files that plane is itself the MXUPHL
//!   message: the file carries no instantaneous UPHL, so plain selection
//!   matched MXUPHL by its end-hour score, but the note stays
//!   conservative: a store written from a file that DOES carry
//!   instantaneous UPHL holds top-of-hour snapshots, a lower bound on the
//!   sub-hourly max.)
//! * 10 m wind: pointwise maxima of `wind_speed_10m_max_1h` (the native
//!   sub-hourly `WIND:10 m above ground` max field the GRIB lane
//!   consumed); m/s folds first, knots out. Hours without it read WRF
//!   WSPD10MAX as the wrfout import stores it (`wrf_wspd10max`), the
//!   exact max over the history interval ending at its frame, like
//!   UP_HELI_MAX ([`HISTORY_INTERVAL_MAX_ROWS`]). Hours with neither fall
//!   back to top-of-hour hypot(`u_10m`, `v_10m`) speeds: a genuine lower
//!   bound on the sub-hourly max (the sfc file carries no instantaneous
//!   wind-speed message), named in the strategy note.
//! * 2 m temp/RH/dewpoint/VPD: pointwise max/min/range over the fixed
//!   F001-F024 / F025-F048 / F001-F048 snapshot windows. Temperature and
//!   dewpoint convert K -> degC per hour before the fold and RH clamps to
//!   0..100, mirroring `surface_snapshot_values_for_hour`; VPD reads the
//!   ingest-computed `vpd_2m` derived grid (hPa) instead of recomputing
//!   from temp + RH.
//!
//! Gap handling mirrors the GRIB lane's blocker pattern exactly: a window
//! realizes only when EVERY contributing hour is present, in the store
//! AND carrying the source variable(s) in the expected units. A missing
//! middle hour blocks the product with a reason naming the gap; it is
//! never silently skipped. Window minimums (e.g. 24 h products need F024)
//! reuse the lane's planning blockers verbatim, with the anchor hour = the
//! run's max stored hour.
//!
//! Exact-time stores.  A history written more often than hourly puts the
//! run on the exact-time axis: slots are ordinals and each frame carries
//! its own lead in seconds ([`rw_store::RwsExactTime`]).  Windows are still
//! the whole-hour windows above, served from those leads:
//!
//! * a window (t-W, t] ends only on a frame whose lead is a whole hour,
//!   and needs the stored frames at BOTH of its bounding whole-hour
//!   leads; a frame between hours closes no window and says so;
//! * accumulations and snapshot windows read the frames at their whole-
//!   hour leads, exactly as on the whole-hour axis (the run totals are
//!   cumulative, so the frames between add nothing);
//! * the maxima (UH, 10 m wind) fold EVERY stored frame inside the
//!   window.  WRF's UP_HELI_MAX and WSPD10MAX are reset at each history
//!   write (`gpuwm/core/uh_diag.py`), so on a 15-minute history the
//!   whole-hour frame alone holds only the last quarter hour; a plane read
//!   from an instant (the wrfout 10 m wind, from U10 and V10) is one of the
//!   window's instants and stays a labelled lower bound.  Either way the
//!   frames inside a window must be evenly spaced from its start and the
//!   frame at its start must be stored (unless the window starts with
//!   the run), since a frame that was never stored cannot be folded and
//!   the fold without it reads low ([`WindowGaps`]).  An instant fold
//!   also needs a stored frame at every whole hour of the window, as the
//!   whole-hour axis does.
//!
//! Memory: accumulations stream hour by hour, each hour file is opened
//! once, each needed source plane is read once (`read_full_2d`, ~3.6 ms)
//! and folded into every per-product accumulator that wants it; no
//! per-hour plane outlives its hour iteration.
