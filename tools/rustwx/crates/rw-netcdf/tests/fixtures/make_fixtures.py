"""Regenerate the NetCDF-4/HDF5 fixtures the rw-netcdf suite reads.

The classic-format fixtures are built at test runtime by the in-workspace
`netcdf-writer` crate, so they need no files here.  NetCDF-4 is different:
nothing in the Rust stack WRITES HDF5 (deliberately -- see
crates/netcdf-writer/src/lib.rs), and the code under test exists exactly
because real NetCDF-4 producers store coordinate variables as HDF5
dimension scales that the vendored reader's `variables()` omits.  So the
fixtures are produced by the reference implementations themselves --
netCDF4-python (the C library) and h5py -- and checked in as bytes.

axes.nc4 -- a well-formed NetCDF-4 file, the `recover_dimension_scales`
    subject:
    * dims time(4), lon(3), lat(3), bnds(2); lon and lat share a length
      on purpose, so only the coordinate-variable NAME rule can tell
      their scales apart;
    * coordinate variables time/lon/lat (HDF5 dimension scales, absent
      from the reader's variable table) with CF string attributes;
    * `bnds` has NO coordinate variable: the C library writes the
      "This is a netCDF dimension but not a netCDF variable." NAME
      sentinel, and recovering it would invent a variable netCDF4-python
      does not report;
    * a data variable t2(time, lat, lon) that carries a real
      DIMENSION_LIST, so strict metadata reconstruction succeeds;
    * an extra 1-D dimension scale `zvals` (length 6, added with h5py);
      the reader registers a 1-D scale as a dimension named after
      itself, so it resolves by the coordinate-variable NAME rule;
    * a 2-D dimension scale `corners` (5 x 6, added with h5py).  A 2-D
      dataset can never take the name rule, so each of its axes is
      resolvable only by the unique-length rule: 5 -> the scale's own
      registered dimension, 6 -> zvals.

sizes.nc4 -- a bare h5py file with no netCDF metadata at all: no
    DIMENSION_LIST anywhere.  Strict reconstruction must fail and the
    size-inferred fallback must open it, which is the `open()`
    provenance contract.

mixed.nc4 -- a netCDF4-python file whose dimensions row(3) and col(3)
    share a length, plus an h5py dataset `orphan` with no DIMENSION_LIST
    (the ERA5 `number`/`expver` shape).  Strict reconstruction fails on
    `orphan`, the fallback opens it, and the file's real dimension table
    survives into the fallback -- so `dimension_lengths_ambiguous` must
    come back true.
