//! Ingest-time derived + heavy precompute: decode the surface + pressure
//! thermodynamic pair from the already-fetched family GRIB bytes through
//! the SAME products decode lane the derived/heavy render paths use
//! (`rustwx_products::gridded::decode_store_thermo_pair_owned`: same
//! message matching, same moisture preference with specific humidity
//! first, same f64 precision), then run all 29 non-heavy derived recipes
//! and all 16 heavy ECAPE-class recipes through the products store lanes
//! (`compute_store_derived_grids_f32` / `compute_store_heavy_grids_f32`:
//! the exact prep + kernel dispatch the render lanes run, emitting the
//! same `as f32` cast grid per recipe), handing back f32 grids ready to
//! store as ordinary 2D variables named by recipe slug.
//!
//! No science lives here, and no input lives here either: an earlier
//! version assembled the compute inputs from the f32 extraction planes,
//! which rounded every input through f32 and (worse) sourced 2 m
//! moisture from dewpoint while the render lane's decode prefers the 2 m
//! specific-humidity message the HRRR sfc file actually carries. Stored
//! grids were therefore NOT the grids the render lane computes. Decoding
//! the pair through the render lane's own decoder makes the stored grids
//! bit-identical to a render-lane compute over the same files (the only
//! rounding is the single f64 -> f32 cast in the store lanes, which is
//! exactly the cast the render lane applies when it builds its `Field2D`).
//! Native CAPE planes (the heavy native-ratio denominators) ride on the
//! decoded `SurfaceFields` the same way they do in the render lane.
//!
//! Memory shape: [`decode_products_inputs`] also builds the ONE height-AGL
//! volume both compute stages consume (an in-place transform of the gh
//! volume: see `prepare_store_compute_inputs`), and the heavy stage takes
//! the inputs BY VALUE so the f64 thermo volumes are freed inside the
//! products lane as soon as the kernels are done with them.
