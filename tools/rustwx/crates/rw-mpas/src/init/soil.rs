//! Soil layers and the surface companions, from `mpas_atmphys_initialize_real.F`.
//!
//! Everything here is counts, not flags: the first-guess sanity check, the
//! dry-land floor, the water fill and the unbracketed-layer divergence all
//! reach the receipt as numbers a reader can weigh.
//!
//! ## Two things this module does on purpose that the Fortran does not
//!
//! 1. **Unbracketed layers refuse.**  When no first-guess pair brackets a NOAH
//!    layer's mid-depth, the Fortran's inner loop simply runs out and the
//!    layer keeps whatever was in the array: uninitialised memory on the
//!    first cell, the previous cell's value afterwards.  That is undefined
//!    behaviour, not intended behaviour, and this port refuses on a non-zero
//!    count naming cells and depths.  The rule is the standing one: where the
//!    reference is undefined, implement the defined behaviour and document the
//!    divergence rather than reproduce a bug bit for bit.
//!
//! 2. **The deep-moisture off-by-one is switchable.**  The Fortran seeds the
//!    3.0 m bottom of the augmented column with `sm_input(nFGSoilLevels)`.
//!    `sm_input` is offset one from `sm_fg`, so that index is the
//!    *second-deepest* first-guess level, not the deepest.  [`DeepMoisture`]
//!    reproduces it for the comparison arm and offers the corrected choice
//!    beside it, and the run counts the cells where the two differ so the size
//!    of the artefact is known rather than assumed.
