//! Sampling an unstructured spherical source onto arbitrary target points.
//!
//! The horizontal half of a parent-native boundary transfer.  Nothing in this
//! module knows what model produced the source or what the target is for: it
//! is given cell centres, the dual triangulation that connects them, edge
//! locations with their normal angles, and it answers two questions.
//!
//! * **Cell fields**: [`SphereSampler::cell_weights`] returns the three
//!   source cells and barycentric weights whose combination is the target
//!   point.  Linear-exact: a field that is linear in the embedding coordinates
//!   is reproduced exactly, and a target sitting on a source cell centre
//!   reproduces that cell's value.
//! * **Edge-normal fields**: [`SphereSampler::edge_operator`] returns a fixed
//!   row of coefficients over nearby source edges such that
//!   `u_target = sum(coef_j * u_source_j)`.  The two-component earth-relative
//!   wind is recovered from the source's normal components by a locally
//!   weighted least-squares fit and then projected onto the target's own
//!   normal.
//!
//! Both operators are geometry-only: they are computed once per target point
//! and reused for every vertical level and every valid time, which is what
//! makes a long boundary series cheap.
//!
//! ## The coincidence snap
//! A target point that lands on a source point is a *degenerate* transfer, and
//! a transfer operator that cannot reproduce identity on a degenerate transfer
//! is wrong.  Solving the 3x3 barycentric system at a coincident point already
//! returns weights within a few units in the last place of `(1, 0, 0)`, which
//! survives the cast to `f32` in almost every case, but "almost every" is not
//! a property worth resting a proof on.  When the target is within
//! [`SNAP_RADIANS`] of a source point the operator collapses to that point,
//! exactly.  This is a property of the operator, not of any particular source:
//! coincident nodes snap whether the source is a forecast of our own or
//! anyone else's.
//!
//! [`SphereSampler::without_snap`] turns it off, so the operator's accuracy
//! without the snap can be measured rather than assumed.
//!
//! ## The skirt, and why containment is not the convex hull
//! A source's *domain* is the union of its cells.  Its dual triangulation
//! covers less than that: the triangulation stops at the outermost cell
//! centres, while the cells themselves reach half a spacing further out.  On a
//! culled regional mesh that gap is not academic: the mesh's own outermost
//! edge midpoints sit in it, so a mesh is not even contained in its own
//! triangulation.  Refusing there would refuse the degenerate transfer, which
//! is the one case that must work.
//!
//! So a target is placed in one of three ways, and the caller is told which:
//!
//! * inside a dual triangle: barycentric weights, linear-exact;
//! * outside the triangulation but within its nearest source cell's own reach:
//!   that cell's value, unweighted, which is what the source itself holds
//!   over that area.  [`CellOperator::skirt`] marks it and the receipt counts
//!   it, because a skirt point is first-order where the interior is second;
//! * further out than that: genuinely outside the source, and refused.
//!
//! A cell's reach is the circumradius of a regular hexagon with that cell's
//! largest neighbour spacing.  For the hexagons that make up almost all of a
//! spherical centroidal Voronoi mesh that is the distance to its own corners,
//! exactly; for the twelve pentagons and for a distorted cell it is generous
//! by a fraction of one cell, which is the right direction to err when the
//! alternative is refusing a boundary that is really there.
