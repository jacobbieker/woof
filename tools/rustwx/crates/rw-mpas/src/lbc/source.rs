//! The driving-source registry: what a boundary producer is allowed to be
//! told about where its numbers come from.
//!
//! A driving source is **described, never coded**.  A row names the reader
//! that opens the source's files, the geometry that samples them, the kind of
//! state they carry, and (the part that does the real work) the map from the
//! canonical roles this producer needs to whatever that source calls them.
//! Adding a model is adding a row.
//!
//! That is not a claim made in a comment.  Three rows ship, and two of them
//! differ **only** in the map and one column:
//!
//! * `wps-intermediate`: the source-agnostic intermediate every registered
//!   external model already arrives as, on a regular latitude/longitude grid,
//!   carrying a first-guess state.  This is the incumbent row and the
//!   producer's default.
//! * `unstructured-native-stream`: an unstructured spherical mesh carrying a
//!   prognostic state, spelled the way MPAS v8.4.1's own history, init and
//!   restart streams spell it (`u`, `theta`, `rho`, ..., with `xtime`).
//! * `unstructured-port-stream`: the same source kind, spelled the way this
//!   program's own forecast history spells it: the edge wind is `normal_u`,
//!   and there is no `xtime` variable, so the valid time is the caller's.
//!
//! The distance between the last two is two map entries and one column.  A
//! fourth unstructured model (anyone's, ours or not) is the same distance
//! away, and [`crate::lbc::parent`]'s tests pin that by driving the whole
//! producer from a row that exists only in a test fixture.
//!
//! ## Why geometry and not model
//! The row does not name a model.  It names a *grid family*, because that is
//! the only thing a sampler can actually be written against: a regular
//! latitude/longitude array, a projected array, an unstructured sphere.  Every
//! model is a row over one of those; a model that shares a family with an
//! existing row costs no code at all.
