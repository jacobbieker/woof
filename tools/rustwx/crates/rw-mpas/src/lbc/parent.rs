//! The parent-native boundary route: a lateral-boundary stream produced from
//! another run's own output, on its own mesh, on its own levels.
//!
//! ## What this route is for
//! A cascade: a coarse graded global driving a limited-area run driving a
//! small high-resolution swath: needs each level to hand the next one a
//! boundary.  Every part of that chain already existed except this: the
//! boundary producer consumed external-model first guesses and nothing else.
//!
//! ## The route, and what it costs
//! Two routes were open.  The first converts a parent's output into WPS
//! intermediates and reuses [`crate::lbc`]'s existing path unchanged.  The
//! second samples the parent onto the child's own cells and edges directly.
//! This module is the second.
//!
//! The first route's cost is not bookkeeping, it is fidelity, and it is
//! charged three times.  It resamples an unstructured mesh onto a regular
//! latitude/longitude array and then samples that array back onto an
//! unstructured mesh, so every field pays two interpolations where one would
//! do, and the intermediate grid's spacing: a number nobody has a principled
//! way to choose: sets how much of the parent survives.  It flattens the
//! parent's terrain-following column onto whatever level set the intermediate
//! carries, discarding the vertical structure the parent actually ran on.  And
//! it would then rebuild the boundary state through `init_atm_case_lbc`'s
//! first-guess pipeline: a hydrostatic rebalance that overwrites the parent's
//! own density with a re-derived one, and a vertical velocity reconstructed
//! from horizontal mass flux over sloping coordinate surfaces, which is the
//! right answer for a pressure-level first guess that has no vertical motion
//! in it, and the wrong answer for a parent that does.  Self-nesting exists to
//! carry the parent's convection to the child's boundary; a route that
//! discards `w` and re-derives `rho` gives that away at the door.
//!
//! What the second route costs is one new geometry operator: unstructured
//! source onto unstructured target, in [`crate::lbc::sphere`], and the
//! vertical remap below.  That is the whole bill, and it buys a transfer that
//! is exactly the identity when the child mesh is the parent mesh.
//!
//! ## Why no state is rebuilt
//! Measured, not assumed.  Against the 2026-08-25 regional oracle at x1, the
//! native case-7 initial state and the native case-9 boundary file at the same
//! valid time agree to `0.0` on `theta` and `qv` (bit for bit) and to
//! `4.9e-7` relative on `rho`.  The lbc stream's contents *are* the model's own
//! decoupled state: `lbc_theta` is `theta`, `lbc_rho` is `rho`, `lbc_qv` is
//! `qv`, `lbc_u` is `u`, `lbc_w` is `w`.  So the parent-native route carries
//! them across and remaps them; it does not rebuild them.  The only place it
//! departs from the first-guess pipeline's arithmetic is where that pipeline
//! was reconstructing what a parent already has.
//!
//! ## The two divergences from the first-guess route, both deliberate
//! * **Density is remapped in the log.**  `rho` falls off exponentially with
//!   height; interpolating it linearly in `z` biases every level low between
//!   the parent's layers.  `init_atm_case_lbc` treats pressure exactly this
//!   way for exactly this reason.
//! * **A one-cell edge takes its height column from the cell that exists.**
//!   The first-guess route reproduces native's arithmetic at the outer edges
//!   of a culled mesh, where a stored-zero `cellsOnEdge` entry contributes a
//!   column of zeros to the four-point mean that sets the target height.  That
//!   is native's own behaviour and the pin requires it there.  Here it would
//!   halve the target height at exactly the outermost boundary ring and sample
//!   the parent's column at the wrong altitude, so the mean is taken over the
//!   cells that exist.  The count is in the receipt.
