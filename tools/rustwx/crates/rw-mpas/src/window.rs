//! Two kinds, because the renderer treats them differently. A Lambert window
//! emulates a WRF domain and gets the renderer's native regional map
//! furniture; a regular latitude/longitude window is the accurate shape for a
//! global overview. The Lambert setup and the two transforms below are WRF

//!
//! Two windows are FIXED boxes -- `focus` and `global` -- and their geometry
//! is frozen: their `weights_sha256` values are recorded in evidence already
//! written, and moving a corner by a metre changes every one of those digests
//! without changing a filename. The third, [`Window::mesh_focus`], is DERIVED
