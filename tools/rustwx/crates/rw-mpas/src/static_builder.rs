    // 128,019-cell mesh in 435 s and then lost its static outright:
    // `albedo_modis mapped no valid pixels to cell 111276`.  The archive is
    // not broken and the mesh is not broken.  MODIS surface albedo is a
    // LAND-ONLY product, and the Antarctic sea-ice margin is the one band on
    // earth where the land-use archive calls a cell ice -- so the model's own
    // landmask says land -- while every albedo pixel inside it is fill.
    // Measured in the archive: at 55 S through 65 S the albedo planes are
    // 100 % fill over the Southern Ocean at every longitude sampled, and the
    // continent's own pixels resume around 67.5 S.  On a 96 km parent, and on
    // the 4.6 km grid this project placed at 60.1 S, no single cell fell
    // entirely inside that band; at 66.4 S one did, and one cell cost the
    // whole grid.
    //
    // A cell with no sample of its own now takes the mean of the neighbours
    // that have one, spreading outward over the mesh's own cellsOnCell until
    // every cell that needs a value has one.  Excluded cells conduct a value
    // without keeping it, so an ice margin separated from the continent by
    // open water is still reached.  The refusal is not removed -- it is moved
    // to the case it was actually written for, a field with no valid pixel
    // ANYWHERE that a value could come from, and it now says how many cells
    // and where one of them is.

/// Bytes the tile-map cache would like, capped so the ask stays sane.

/// geometry: without a cap the ask on a global mesh is the raw size of every
/// unique map at once, tens of gigabytes, most of which the run-length
/// encoding never needs.  The cap keeps the *predicted peak* -- and therefore
/// the admission gate -- from being dominated by a term the cache will not
/// actually use, while still leaving room for every map a global build needs.
///
/// MEASURED 2026-08-26 (stale-guard audit 2026-08-25, tile-cache
/// adjudication), full-geography global builds, receipts beside the packs:
///
/// * 12,002 cells: cache stored 93.5 MiB encoded (1,962 maps, 0 declined);
///   predicted peak 8.42 GiB, OS peak working set 2.73 GB.
/// * 654,432 cells: cache stored 608 MiB encoded (1,962 maps, 0 declined);
///   predicted peak 8.94 GiB, OS peak working set 4.48 GB.
///
/// So the cap is LIVE as the cache's budget -- encoded use grows roughly
/// with the square root of cell count (~2.4 GiB extrapolated at 10 M
/// cells), and 4 GiB holds headroom for every global build in reach while
/// `declined_for_budget` in the receipt makes an overflow visible.  What
/// the measurements also show, recorded as a named follow-up rather than
/// fixed by guess: charging the FULL cap into `predicted_peak_bytes`
/// over-prices a global build by ~2-3x against the measured peak, because
/// the raw-sum ask saturates the cap while the encoded reality is 2-14% of
/// it.  A measured-scaling prediction term needs a third point in the
