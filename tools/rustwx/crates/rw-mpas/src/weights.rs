//! Nearest-cell resample weights: the one-time, per-mesh half of the bridge.
//!
//! Method: nearest cell centre on the sphere, by 3-D chord distance through a
//! k-d tree over unit vectors. Nearest-cell is a deliberate choice, not a
//! shortcut. A resampled value is exactly the value the model carried in that
//! cell, so extremes survive the transfer unchanged: a 70 dBZ core stays
//! 70 dBZ, a 35 m/s gust stays 35 m/s. Every smoothing scheme, inverse
//! distance included, pulls maxima down and pushes minima up, which is the
//! wrong trade for products whose whole point is the tail of the
//! distribution.
//!
//! Nothing here is conservative and nothing produced through this path
//! supports an accumulation-budget claim.
