    // mesh `v16.66.195630` was emitted through this very function carrying one
    // 4-coordinated cell -- 195615, at 33.74N 117.65W, put there by
    // `surgery`'s S2 insertion -- and every check above passed it, because the
    // same operation makes two heptagons and `sum(6 - nEdgesOnCell)` still
    // reads 12 exactly. That mesh bound, allocated, integrated 22 steps and
    // died at step 23 of 36: the model's theta maximum and its |w| maximum sat
    // on that one cell at the top model level in every arm, ~197 K above its
    // initial value at 1,800 s, and the anomaly was TIMESTEP CONVERGED across
    // a 5x range (197.4 K at dt 100 s, 197.7 K at 75 s, 181.3 K at 20 s) --
    // so a finer timestep bought 2 h 45 m of model time instead of 38 minutes
    // and never bought a forecast. A 224,210-cell sibling from the same
    // generator carries the same defect at cell 224206.

    // The floor is ONE-SIDED by measurement, and deliberately so: the
    // 8-coordinated cell in that same mesh (168727) is nowhere near the top
    // forty by growth in any arm, and `v20.80.151649` completes six forecast
    // hours with 1,017 heptagons. Refusing high coordination would be a gate
    // with no breakage behind it.
    //
    // The producer-side fix is `surgery::MIN_COORDINATION` and the
