//! The device footprint of a full-physics MPAS run, PER CARD.
//!
//! `footprint(cells) = fixed_mib + cells * bytes_per_cell`. It is a MEMORY
//! model, not a skill or a speed claim.
//!
//! # Why the fixed term cannot be one constant
//!
//! Most of it is a single allocation: the CUDA per-context LOCAL-MEMORY
//! BACKING STORE. The driver sizes that store for the widest launched kernel
//! frame at FULL RESIDENCY and never returns it while the context lives:
//!
//! ```text
//! store_bytes = (widest_kernel_frame_bytes - 1024) * SMs * maxThreadsPerSM
//! ```
//!
//! Two of the three factors are properties of the PART. A 70 SM card and a
//! 170 SM card therefore pay different fixed terms for identical code, and a
//! fixed term quoted without naming the card says nothing.
//!
//! MEASURED, null launches, one kernel and one fresh process each, sm_120:
//!
//! | kernel             | frame B | 70 SM measured | 170 SM measured |
//! |--------------------|--------:|---------------:|----------------:|
//! | `gf_gfdrv_stage`   |  29,264 |    2,896.0 MiB |     7,034.0 MiB |
//! | `gf_deep_stage`    |  26,880 |    2,650.0 MiB |     6,438.0 MiB |
//! | `gf_shallow_stage` |  18,944 |    1,836.0 MiB |     4,462.0 MiB |
//! | `rlw_rtrn_march`   |   2,048 |      104.0 MiB |       254.0 MiB |
//! | `rlw_cldprmc`      |      64 |        0.0 MiB |               - |
//! | no local frame     |       0 |        0.0 MiB |         0.0 MiB |
//!
//! [`local_store_mib`] reproduces every one of those rows to better than
//! 0.15 % on BOTH parts, and the zero-frame row is the negative control that
//! says the meter is reading the store and not something else.
//!
//! # What is derived, and what is only measured
//!
//! Subtracting the derived store from each card's measured fixed term leaves
//! a RESIDUE -- the context, the module images, the driver's own scratch, and
//! whatever else is resident before the first cell exists:
//!
//! | card        | SMs | derived store | measured fixed | residue     |
//! |-------------|----:|--------------:|---------------:|------------:|
//! | RTX 5090    | 170 |   7,032.4 MiB |    9,798.0 MiB | 2,765.6 MiB |
//! | RTX 5070 Ti |  70 |   2,895.7 MiB |    5,384.0 MiB | 2,488.3 MiB |
//!
//! The derived store accounts for 4,138.0 MiB of the 4,410.0 MiB that
//! separates the two cards' fixed terms. The residue accounts for the rest --
//! and it is NOT the same number on the two parts and does NOT scale with the
//! SM count, so it cannot be predicted for a part nobody has run.
//!
//! That is why [`Card::measured`] is an `Option` and why an unmeasured card
//! is REFUSED here (see [`Card::unmeasured_refusal`]) instead of being handed
//! the derived store plus a borrowed residue.
//!
//! # Every number here belongs to ONE build
//!
//! The MPAS port runs ArWen's physics from a pinned checkout, and each
//! residue above was taken by subtracting the derived store from a measured
//! fixed term ON THAT BUILD. So the frame, the residues and the pin are a
//! single measurement set: see [`MEASURED_AGAINST_ARWEN_COMMIT`],
//! [`FRAME_CUT_COMMIT`] and the staleness argument on
//! [`WIDEST_KERNEL_FRAME_BYTES`]. The tree this file lives in has ALREADY cut
//! that frame; the pin has not moved, which is the only reason these numbers
//! still stand.
//!
//! # Adding a card is a row
//!
//! [`CARDS`] is a table. A new part is a row with its SM count, its
//! `maxThreadsPerSM`, and -- once somebody runs it -- a measured residue,
//! the checkout that residue was measured against, and its anchors. No new
//! code path, ever.
