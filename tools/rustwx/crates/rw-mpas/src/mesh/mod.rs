//! MPAS mesh generation, in Rust.
//!
//! The pipeline is: a resolution spec (data, never code) -> initial points ->
//! Lloyd/SCVT relaxation -> spherical Delaunay -> the full MPAS field set ->
//! self-validation -> a classic-netCDF grid file.
//!
//! What this module DOES NOT produce is a `static` file. A grid file alone
//! cannot reach the dycore: the mesh registry also demands a matching static
//! carrying terrain, land use and soil on the same cells, `nVertLevels = 55`,
//! `nSoilLevels = 4` and an FP32-bit-exact `nominalMinDc`. That boundary is
//! named here so nobody reads a valid grid file as a runnable mesh.

/// The strip is BY SHAPE, not by a hand-kept list of field names: every key
/// ending in `_seconds` goes, at any depth. A duration added to the receipt
/// later is therefore excluded the day it is added, with no second edit --
/// which is the same reason the mesh registry is a table and not a code path.
/// Generic over the receipt type on purpose: `rw_mpas_mesh` has two routes
/// (generate and rebuild-from-centres) with two receipt types, and a rule that
/// only one route obeyed would be worse than no rule.
