//! The resolution spec: what the user asks for, expressed as DATA.
//!
//! A spec is a background spacing plus a list of refinement regions. Every
//! region names a shape, a spacing and a transition width. Adding a new place
//! to refine -- any box, any cap, any polygon, anywhere, at any spacing, at any
//! ratio -- is a row in this file's `regions` array and touches no code. The
//! only per-shape code in the crate is one `signed_distance` method of about
//! ten lines, and a new shape kind is the only thing that has ever needed one.
//!
//! Example:
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "background_km": 120.0,
//!   "regions": [
//!     { "shape": { "kind": "cap", "center_deg": [39.0, -98.0], "radius_km": 1200 },
//!       "spacing_km": 20.0, "transition_km": 900.0 }
//!   ]
//! }
//! ```

// THE DEVICE FOOTPRINT MODEL DOES NOT LIVE HERE ANY MORE.
//
// It used to: two file-scope constants, `9798 MiB + cells * 86630 B`, applied
// to every caller. Those are ONE CARD's numbers -- an RTX 5090's -- and the
// help text above them called the result "the measured footprint model"
// without ever saying which card was measured. A 16 GiB owner was told
// 79,717 cells and a 10 GiB owner 5,350, when the 70 SM part that owners
// actually have measures 5,384 MiB fixed instead of 9,798 and holds 133,144
// and 58,777 at the same budgets: 1.6x and 11x out, in opposite directions.
//
// The fixed term is a property of the PART, because CUDA sizes the
// per-context local-memory backing store from the card's resident-thread
// capacity. It is therefore derived per card in [`crate::mesh::footprint`],
// and a card nobody has measured is refused by name rather than handed a
// neighbour's number.
