//! Hierarchical Goldberg refinement: graded meshes with no Fibonacci lattice
//! at any level.
//!
//! THE MECHANISM. Level 0 is the proven uniform Goldberg path (12 pentagons,
//! min dv/dc 0.39 class). Each level halves the spacing by density-driven
//! Delaunay edge-midpoint insertion: full midpoint insertion on GP(m, n) IS
//! GP(2m, 2n), so the interior of a refined patch is the same measured-clean
//! crystal, and irregularity is confined BY CONSTRUCTION to the nested
//! transition annuli where the level field varies. Each level is annealed by
//! the existing weighted Lloyd under the level-clamped field, then the
//! residual near-cocircular quads in the annuli are drained by
//! count-changing surgery ([`crate::mesh::surgery`]) -- the degree of
//! freedom relaxation does not have (campaign #304: `--sweeps` 200/600/2000
//! all reproduced the same 75.04 m collapsed edge; the recorded
//! `v15.150.38857` failure is 61 edges under the 0.02 admission floor from a
//! density-biased Fibonacci seed).
//!
//! The target class is the PUBLISHED-VARIABLE band (x4.163842: 44 pentagons
//! + 32 heptagons, min dv/dc 0.03365), not defect-free, which topology
//! forbids on a graded sphere and no gate requires.
//!
//! Determinism: no RNG anywhere -- the seed is the icosahedral lattice,
//! insertion order is canonical edge order, surgery orders by
//! (`f64::total_cmp`, canonical edge id). A grid registry pins files by
//! SHA-256; regeneration must reproduce the bytes.
