//! Spherical Delaunay triangulation, as a three-dimensional convex hull.
//!
//! For points ON a sphere the convex hull IS the Delaunay triangulation: a
//! triangle has an empty spherical circumcircle exactly when every other point
//! lies on one side of its plane, which is the hull's own visibility test.
//!
//! THE DEGENERACY THAT KILLS A NAIVE IMPLEMENTATION, stated here because it is
//! the single most likely way to build a silently-broken generator: all the
//! points are COSPHERICAL, so the classical lifted-paraboloid `insphere(a,b,c,d)`
//! predicate returns exactly 0 for every quadruple. Reaching for a
//! lifted-Delaunay library hands back a zero-information answer on every test.
//! The correct in-circle test here is `orient3d` on a consistently oriented
//! facet -- see [`crate::mesh::geom::orient3d`], which is evaluated in
//! double-double arithmetic because the naive f64 determinant has only four
//! decades of margin at 3 km spacing, and 3 km is inside the range this door
//! will be asked for.
//!
//! The algorithm is randomized-incremental with conflict lists (Clarkson-Shor),
//! expected O(n log n). The insertion order comes from a counter-based PRNG
//! seeded from the point count, so a mesh is reproducible between runs and
//! between machines.

// ======================================================================
// THE MAINTAINED TRIANGULATION -- CLASS B ONLY
// ======================================================================
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR, in one sentence: the relaxation rebuilds the whole
// spherical Delaunay from scratch after every sweep to discover that almost
// nothing moved, and this is the machinery that discovers the same thing by
// repairing what it already has.
//
// THE MEASUREMENT THAT JUSTIFIES IT (profile lane, 2026-08-29, a development machine): a
// rebuild costs 88.1 ms on a 54,247-cell graded mesh and 234.9 ms at 159,898,
// against 0.93 ms and 2.13 ms for one Lawson pass over the previous
// triangulation at the moved positions -- 95x and 110x -- and the pass finds
// 13.0 and 63.2 non-Delaunay edges out of 286,000 and 610,912. On the
// published UNIFORM family it finds exactly ZERO, every sweep, for 195 and 122
// consecutive sweeps, while 196 and 123 full rebuilds were performed.
//
// WHY IT IS CLASS B AND CAN NEVER BE ANYTHING ELSE. A rebuilt triangulation
// returns the same neighbour SET but a DIFFERENT ring rotation for 26.7-26.9%
// of cells on the uniform family and 4-16% on graded meshes, every sweep,
// because the facet array is laid out by the randomized insertion order. The
// centroid quadrature sums its sub-triangles in ring order and floating-point
// addition is not associative, so a rotated ring moves the generator's
// centroid in its last bits; the emitted grid file also records the rotation
// directly. A maintained triangulation KEEPS the rotation it had, which is
// exactly why it is cheap and exactly why it cannot reproduce a registered
// digest. This module states above that MPAS does not fix the starting slot;
// making it canonical would collapse the two classes and is a ruling nobody
// on this lane is entitled to make.
//
// WHAT IT DOES GUARANTEE. On termination every edge of the maintained surface
// is locally Delaunay, the facet count is still 2n-4, and `rings_from_faces`
// has accepted every ring as a closed, repeat-free manifold loop. A closed
// polyhedral surface whose vertices are cospherical and whose every edge is
// locally convex IS the convex hull of those vertices, and on cospherical
// points the convex hull IS the Delaunay triangulation -- so the maintained
// arm returns the SAME TRIANGULATION a rebuild would return, differing only in
// the ring rotation. That is the class-B quality claim, and the distributions
// in the receipt are what test it.

/// WHICH ARM keeps the triangulation between sweeps, stated in the request
/// rather than inferred.
///
/// THE BREAKAGE THIS ENUM PREVENTS, and it is the whole reason it is a request
/// field and not a heuristic: a maintained triangulation produces a DIFFERENT
/// GRID FILE from the same generators (see [`Triangulation`]). If the
/// generator chose the arm for itself, `rw_mpas_mesh --cells 40962` would
