//! Icosahedral (Goldberg) seeding for uniform meshes.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. A Fibonacci-seeded uniform SCVT is polycrystalline: its
//! Delaunay carries pentagon-heptagon dislocation pairs beyond the twelve
//! pentagons topology requires, and a dislocation quad is near-cocircular, so
//! its dual edge can be arbitrarily short AT EQUILIBRIUM. Measured on the
//! shipped pipeline at a 120 km background: shortest dual edge 7,337.6 m at
//! 2,000 cells, 75.0 m at 12,000, 7.2 m at 40,962 -- and `--sweeps` 200, 600
//! and 2000 all reproduce the same short edges, because relaxation re-rolls
//! the tail rather than draining it. The published x1.40962 has no dual edge
//! under 45 km at the same cell count because it IS a subdivided icosahedron:
//! exactly 12 pentagons, no heptagons, nothing for a near-cocircular quad to
//! form around.
//!
//! So uniform meshes seed the same way the published family was built: the
//! vertices of a Goldberg subdivision GP(m, n) of the icosahedron, projected
//! to the sphere. Lloyd then polishes GEOMETRY on a topology that has no
//! dislocations to begin with. The defect class does not exist here, rather
//! than being caught afterwards.
//!
//! THE COUNT IS SNAPPED. GP(m, n) delivers exactly `10*(m^2 + mn + n^2) + 2`
//! cells, so an arbitrary request is moved to the nearest achievable count
//! (127,051 -> 127,032 via GP(102,19), -0.015%) and the move is recorded in
//! the receipt. Variable-resolution meshes keep the density-biased Fibonacci
//! seed: their refinement gradient is incompatible with a global subdivision,
//! and their dislocations are topologically unavoidable.
