//! What is left of the FIRST static writer: the schema it pinned, the grader
//! it shipped, the archive ladder it walked, and the FP32 reading it took.
//!
//! # Why this module is a remnant
//!
//! This crate carried two static writers. `staticfile::emit` wrote the 69
//! variables the mesh registry pins and owned the `rw_mpas_static` name;
//! [`crate::static_builder`] wrote 56 under host-memory admission with a
//! byte-identical parallel tile decode, and was reached only through a second
//! binary. They were built against different consumers and neither knew about
//! the other, so one edit to a `use` line was enough to hand a user the wrong
//! file with the right name -- a static with no `var2d`, no `oa1..oa4`, no
//! `cellsOnVertex` and no `kiteAreasOnVertex`, refused at registration by byte
//! count. [`schema`] is the gate that said so, and it was RED on purpose until
//! the two converged.
//!
//! They have converged. The STREAMING builder is the survivor -- it is the one
//! whose memory is bounded, whose tile decode is parallel and deterministic,
//! and whose refusals name what they prevent -- and the computations this
//! writer owned moved into it rather than being rewritten:
//!
//! * the sub-grid orography statistics are [`crate::static_gwd`], reading the
//!   archive's own georeferencing instead of assuming the Fortran's;
//! * `deriv_two` and the deformation weights are `crate::static_operators`;
//! * the mesh dual and the local frames are read and written by
//!   `crate::static_builder`;
//! * the two measured unit conversions are constants there, still table data.
//!
//! What stayed here is what was never about writing a file: the pinned
//! manifest, the field-by-field grader `--compare` runs, the ladder that
//! agrees with where `gpuwm fetch-geog` stages, and the FP32 metric reading.
