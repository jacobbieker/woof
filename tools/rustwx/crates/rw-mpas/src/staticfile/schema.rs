//! The static schema the mesh registry pins, and the gate that holds the
//! writer to it.
//!
//! THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS. This crate carried two static writers, built
//! against different consumers, neither knowing about the other. One wrote 69
//! variables and owned the `rw_mpas_static` name; the other wrote 56 under
//! host-memory admission. With both compiled in, one edit to a `[[bin]]` path
//! or one `use` line was enough to point `rw_mpas_static` -- and therefore
//! `gpuwm mesh` -- at the wrong one, and nothing would have said so: the build
//! stays green, the binary keeps its name, the run exits 0, and a user gets a
//! static with no `var2d`, no `oa1..oa4`, no `ol1..ol4`, no `cellsOnVertex` and
//! no `kiteAreasOnVertex`. The mesh registry pins grid and static together by
//! byte count and SHA-256, so that file is refused at registration, and a
//! forecast that reached one anyway would run a dycore with no sub-grid
//! orography and no vertex duals.
//!
//! ONE WRITER NOW SERVES THE DOOR. [`crate::static_builder`] is it: the
//! streaming, admission-gated, rayon-parallel builder, carrying the tested
//! computations the 69-variable writer owned. The manifest is pinned here in
//! one place, the writer refuses at write time if what it is about to declare
//! has drifted from it, and [`gate_bounded_writer_matches_pin`] holds its
//! declared manifest to the same list.
//!
//! THE PIN IS THE UNION, 82 NAMES. The first 69 are the published static's own
//! manifest, in the published order. The 13 that follow are what the streaming
//! builder brings and the published file never carried: the four
//! deformation/gradient operator tables, the Noah-MP soil-composition group,
//! and the land-use aliases and category scalars a surface scheme reads by
//! name. Dropping any of them to "match the published file" would put the
//! consumer back where it was -- reading a static and finding the array it
//! needs is not there.

/// Every variable the pinned static carries, in the order it is declared.
///
/// This is the registered schema: the port registry pins a static of exactly
/// these 82 variables, and a file that carries a different set is a different
/// file by byte count before it is a different file by content.
