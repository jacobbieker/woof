//! The judge's arithmetic, written so a reader can check it against the
//! reference implementation line by line.
//!
//! This crate is a verification instrument, so its summary statistics must
//! agree with the reference judge's rather than merely be defensible.  Four
//! choices here exist only for that reason and are called out where they are
//! made:
//!
//! * `tree_sum_by` reproduces the block-of-128, eight-accumulator summation
//!   the reference stack's kernel uses instead of a naive running total, so a
//!   mean over a quarter-million cells lands on the same bits rather than
//!   merely the same first ten digits;
//! * `REDUCTION_BUFFER` reproduces the *buffering around* that kernel.  A
//!   whole-array reduction is a sequence of trees, not one tree, and past
//!   about a million elements the difference is visible in the last bit;
//! * [`percentile_linear`] reproduces the reference `linear` quantile: the
//!   same virtual-index expression, the same out-of-range index clamping, and
//!   the same two-sided interpolation that switches formula at gamma 0.5;
//! * [`accumulation_sum_f32`] reproduces a *single-precision* accumulation,
//!   because the reference judge sums the accumulation fields in the on-disk
//!   dtype rather than promoting first.  It is the one place where the
//!   reference is the less accurate of the two, so the f64 value is carried
//!   beside it rather than instead of it.
