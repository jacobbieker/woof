//! Store-ingest derived lane: compute every supported derived recipe grid

//!
//! This is the same compute path the render/query lanes use. Non-heavy:
//! [`compute_derived_fields_generic`] does the shared input prep (pressure
//! volume, height-AGL assembly, grid spacing) once for all recipes, and
//! [`derived_query_field_from_computed`] maps each recipe to its grid and
//! units. Heavy: [`prepare_heavy_volume`] +
//! [`compute_ecape_map_fields_with_prepared_volume`]: the exact prep +
//! kernel dispatch the ECAPE/heavy render lane runs: produce the panel
//! fields, which are mapped to recipe slugs by their artifact slugs (the
//! two namespaces are identical for heavy recipes). Grids stored at ingest
//! are therefore bit-identical to what the corresponding render lane would
//! compute from the same inputs.
