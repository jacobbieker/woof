//! Atomic file writes ported from rustwx-products/src/publication.rs
//! (`atomic_write_bytes` / `temp_path_for`, rustwx-fastplots-wt): write to a
//! hidden temp file in the same directory, fsync, then rename into place;
//! the temp file is removed on any failure.
//!
//! The port carried one thing that must not survive here. It finalized with
//!
//! ```text
//! if path.exists() { fs::remove_file(path)?; }
//! fs::rename(&tmp_path, path)?;
//! ```
//!
//! which is two operations with a gap between them, and in that gap the
//! destination does not exist. A crash, a power loss, or a killed process
//! landing there loses the previous good artifact and publishes nothing in
//! its place -- the one outcome an atomic write exists to make impossible.
//! Finalization is now the single [`replace_file`] step, which never unlinks
//! the destination at all; see its documentation for why one `fs::rename`
//! is that step on both families this workspace runs on.
