//! Writer-side advisory locks for one rw-store run directory.
//!
//! This is the implementation of the concurrency contract in
//! `docs/FORMAT.md §7`: **at most one process writes a given
//! `<store_root>/<model>/<run>/` directory at a time.** A writer holds an
//! exclusive OS advisory file lock on `<run_dir>/.rw-lock` for the whole
//! critical section (grid validation + hour write + manifest update) and
//! releases it when the [`RunLock`] guard drops.
//!
//! Properties (all promised in FORMAT.md §7):
//!
//! - **Advisory only.** The lock coordinates cooperating *writers*; it does
//!   not stop a process that ignores it. Every shipped writer
//!   (`HourIngestWriter`, the rw-sat frame writer, the rw-sat window prune)
//!   takes it, which is what fixes the real two-process collision that
//!   motivated this work.
//! - **Auto-released on process death.** This is an OS lock (`flock(2)` on
//!   Unix, `LockFileEx` on Windows via `fs4`), *not* a pidfile: if the
//!   holder crashes or is killed, the kernel drops the lock. There is no
//!   stale-lock cleanup to get wrong.
//! - **The lock file persists.** `.rw-lock` is created on demand, stays
//!   zero-length, and is **never deleted**: deleting it would be racy
//!   (another process could be mid-`open`/`lock` on the same path while we
//!   unlink it, and the two would then lock different inodes). Its presence
//!   on disk is normal and is *not itself* the lock; the lock is the kernel
//!   record against the open handle.
//! - **Readers never lock.** Every file mutation in rw-store is an atomic
//!   temp+fsync+rename (`atomic.rs`), so a reader sees either the old file
//!   or the complete new one and needs no lock. Readers, validators, and
//!   listing tools MUST ignore `.rw-lock` (and `.*.tmp-*`).
//!
//! ### fs4 API note
//!
//! `fs4` 1.1 renamed the non-blocking exclusive lock to
//! [`FileExt::try_lock`] (mirroring std's `File::try_lock`, stabilised in
//! 1.89); it returns `Err(TryLockError::WouldBlock)` when the lock is held
//! elsewhere and `Err(TryLockError::Error(io))` on a real I/O failure. The
//! older `try_lock_exclusive() -> io::Result<bool>` surface is gone, so we
//! match on `TryLockError`.
