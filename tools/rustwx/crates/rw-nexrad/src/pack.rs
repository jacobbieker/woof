//! Strict Level-II framing validation and the flat sweep pack.
//!
//! `wx_radar::level2::Level2File::parse` is forgiving by design: it is the
//! renderer's parser, and a renderer that draws 95% of a damaged volume
//! beats one that draws nothing.  An observation front door has the
//! opposite duty, so it reaches for `parse_strict` instead, and every
//! volume is framed-checked *before* it reaches the parser at all: a
//! truncated Archive-II block table, a gzip-wrapped legacy volume, or a
//! file that is not Archive-II at all is refused with the byte offsets that
//! prove it, never silently half-decoded.
//!
//! The two checks catch different things and neither subsumes the other.
//! Framing walks the outer LDM block table, whose lengths can be perfectly
//! valid while an inner Message-31 pointer aims into the next radial;
//! `parse_strict` bounds every block read to the radial that declared it,
//! but only sees bytes the framing already accepted.
//!
//! The pack itself is deliberately dull: a 64-byte little-endian header, a
//! JSON metadata block, and one contiguous payload of `<f4` arrays.  It is
//! the `.rwg` layout from `rw-store` (magic / version / meta_len / payload)
//! carried over so a Python consumer needs `json` and `numpy.frombuffer`
//! and nothing else.
