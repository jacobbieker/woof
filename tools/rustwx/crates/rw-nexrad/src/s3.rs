//! This is the `rw-sat`/`rw-glm` `ListObjectsV2` pattern (paginated with
//! continuation tokens, query-encoded prefixes, XML unescaping, pure-Rust
//! rustls) retold for a bucket whose key space is a day directory per site

///
/// * an **attribute value** ([`xml_attributes`]) may not contain a raw

///   one attribute twice.  A real `<Contents>` moved into the root's
///   `xmlns` value was accepted with a short roster while `scan_xml` called
///   the document well-formed, which it was not (RV6-01);
/// * the **declaration's own body** ([`require_xml_declaration`]) is
///   `version`, then an optional `encoding`, then an optional `standalone`,
///   and nothing else.  Being allowed at byte zero is not being allowed to
///   contain anything (RV6-03).
///
/// Re-verification #8 measured two more places where the reader was reading
/// a language slightly wider than the one it claims, and one where it was
/// not reading at all:
///
/// * `<?>` is three bytes that made this function **panic**.  The terminator
///   was searched for from byte zero, so the `?>` starting at byte 1 was

///   now and the sequence is what it looks like: a `<?...?>` region that
///   never terminates, or a processing instruction with an unreadable
///   target, refused by name either way (RV8-01);
/// * `S` is [`is_xml_space`], the four characters XML 1.0's production
///   names, wherever this function stands at an `S` position: what lies
///   outside the root, what ends a tag name, what ends a PI target, and

///   set of direct children, and a `<KeyCount>` that agrees with the short
///   roster it produced;
/// * the body is not a `<ListBucketResult>` for the bucket and prefix that
///   were asked for;
/// * `<IsTruncated>` is absent or is not exactly `true`/`false`, without
///   it "no continuation token" cannot be distinguished from "the
///   continuation token was lost", which is the whole finding;
/// * the page says it is truncated and carries no usable
///   `<NextContinuationToken>`, or says it is not and carries one anyway;
/// * `<KeyCount>` is absent, unparseable, larger than `<MaxKeys>`, or does
///   not equal the number of `<Contents>` entries actually parsed: this is
///   the bucket's own count of what it put in the page, and it is the check
///   that catches a body cut short by a dropped connection;
/// * any `<Contents>` element is unterminated, or is missing its `<Key>`,
///   `<Size>` or `<LastModified>`.  A missing size used to default to `0`,
///   which silently disarms the byte-count check in
///   [`download_volume`]: a truncated download would then pass;
/// * a key outside the requested prefix, or a key ending in `/`, which is a
///   directory placeholder rather than an object;
/// * a key that cannot be localized -- one carrying a `..` or `.` or empty
