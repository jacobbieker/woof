## sharprs / rusty-weather

- **License:** BSD-3-Clause / MIT
- **Copyright:** © FahrenheitResearch
- **BowEcho crate:** `sharprs` 0.1.0 (vendored)
- **Sources:** <https://github.com/FahrenheitResearch/sharprs>,
  <https://github.com/FahrenheitResearch/rusty-weather>
- **Imported from rusty-weather revision:**
  `cf0ca3693650153ff0f79a0e60c3ec2da7d0af01`

`sharprs` is the pure-Rust SHARPpy calculation engine behind the sounding
analysis (parcels, effective inflow, composite indices); the rusty-weather
crates (`rw-ui`, `rustwx-*`) provide the model-data dock, classic sounding
panel, and satellite/model stack. See each repository for its authoritative
license text.

The complete license notice from BowEcho's vendored `sharprs` crate follows so
the exact release bundles satisfy its MIT and retained SHARPpy BSD-3-Clause
binary-redistribution terms:

## Space Grotesk font

- **License:** SIL Open Font License 1.1
- **Copyright:** © 2020 Florian Karsten (The Space Grotesk Project Authors,
  <https://github.com/floriankarsten/space-grotesk>)

Space Grotesk Regular and Bold are embedded in the `sharppyrs` crate (and thus
in BowEcho binaries) to match the original renderer's face. The full OFL text
ships alongside the fonts at `sharppyrs/assets/fonts/OFL.txt`.

## Source Sans 3 font

- **License:** SIL Open Font License 1.1
- **Copyright:** Copyright 2010-2024 Adobe, with Reserved Font Name "Source"
- **Source:** <https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans>

Source Sans 3 Regular is embedded in the vendored `sharprs` classic sounding
renderer. The copy below is included here because this top-level notice ships
with BowEcho's binary release packages.

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007

PREAMBLE

The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS

"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION

This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

DISCLAIMER

THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT
OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM
OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.

## Natural Earth

- **License:** Public domain
- **Source:** <https://www.naturalearthdata.com/>

The sounding window's locator basemap lines (CONUS state boundaries and
coastline) are simplified from Natural Earth 1:50m vector data, as bundled by
SHARPpy-Reimagined. BowEcho's offline application basemap also contains
generated geometry and labels from Natural Earth 1:50m country boundaries,
1:10m regional administrative boundaries, and 1:10m populated places.

## U.S. Census Bureau cartographic boundary data

- **Source:** U.S. Census Bureau cartographic boundary files
- **Embedded inputs:** `cb_2024_us_state_500k`, `cb_2024_us_county_500k`, and
  `cb_2023_us_place_500k`

BowEcho's offline application basemap contains generated U.S. state/county
geometry and town/place labels derived from these files. The year and dataset
identifiers above are retained from the checked-in
generators and generated-source provenance comments.

## Py-ART region-based velocity dealiasing

- **License:** BSD-3-Clause, with the U.S. DOE / Argonne government-rights
  notice
- **Copyright:** Copyright (c) 2013, UChicago Argonne, LLC. All rights reserved.
- **Sources:** <https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart>,
  <https://github.com/FahrenheitResearch/region-global-dealias>

BowEcho's Region Global velocity solver uses the pinned
`region-global-dealias` Rust port of Py-ART's `dealias_region_based` per-sweep
core. It is modified software, not the Py-ART distribution from Argonne: the
standalone solver works on flat `f32` arrays and replaces the original region
labeling and network-reduction data structures with fold-identical optimized
implementations. The complete upstream notice is reproduced in
[`PYART-LICENSE.txt`](PYART-LICENSE.txt).

The separately selectable RIFT engine uses the same pinned crate's v0.2.0
opt-in gate-resolution refinement. It starts from the unchanged Region Global
result and only accepts bounded local corrections when its independent trigger
and wrapped-vortex fit agree; selecting Region Global does not enable RIFT.

(Py-ART), a Library for Working with Radar Data in the Python Programming
Language. *J. Open Res. Softw.*, **4**(1), e25,

## PyTMatrix-derived property T-matrix research pack

- **License:** MIT
- **Copyright:** Copyright (c) 2013-2023
- **Author:** Jussi Leinonen
- **Source:** <https://github.com/jleinonen/pytmatrix>

BowEcho can optionally download a separately versioned, PyTMatrix 0.3.3-derived
S-band lookup-table pack when the property T-matrix simulated-radar mode is
first used. The exact upstream MIT notice is included inside that downloaded
pack as `PYTMATRIX-LICENSE.txt`. These derived lookup tables are a research
product, have not been independently validated by BowEcho, and must not be
treated as an operational radar calibration.

## weather-contours native engine

- **License:** MIT
- **Copyright:** Copyright (c) 2026 Andrew Snyder / Fahrenheit Research
- **Vendored source:** `vendor/weather-contours`
- **Pristine source archive:**
  `vendor/weather-contours/upstream/autumnplot-weather-contours-sota.zip`
- **Source archive SHA-256:**
  `E9B7F22646BCB2C4938A10B1CE98D33705C41BFB75A134DF28C4E8CE9730E453`

BowEcho includes a modified, native-only copy of the dependency-free OIRT
connected-isoline and COBRM indexed-isoband engine. BowEcho's copy adds stable
degenerate-saddle behavior, exact zero-length path filtering, checked resource
budgets, fallible large allocations, and additional validation and tests.
