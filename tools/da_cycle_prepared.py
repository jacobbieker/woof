"""EXPERIMENTAL: cycling radar DA over a prepared single-domain case.

Forecast legs on the real GPU dycore, a real LETKF analysis between
them, real NEXRAD volumes -- the loop the ensemble engine cannot host
today and that the v1.2 assembly notes call the engine gap: the engine
refuses domain trees and loads only the ``[case_data]`` route, while the
prepared-tree runners are deterministic and hash-bind their own run
bounds.  Until that gap closes this driver is how a prepared case gets
cycled, and it is deliberately written as the reference implementation
the engine work can absorb rather than as a one-off script.

What it does, per leg:

1. wires the model exactly as
   :func:`woof.prepared_single_domain_forecast.run_prepared_forecast`
   does -- same preflight, same prepared-cache restore, same physics
   initialisation, same boundary clock binding, same
   ``execute_experiment`` -- but per trajectory;
2. restores the trajectory's tree checkpoint set from the end of the
   previous leg through the restart owner
   (:func:`woof.io.restart.restore_tree_restart`), which places every
   domain's clock and carries the atmosphere, the physics driver's
   surface and soil state, the precipitation accumulators and the held
   radiation, boundary-layer and cumulus tendencies, exactly as
   ``woof run --restart`` continues a run;
3. applies the pending analysis and integrates one leg on the GPU, with
   the state-health validator on;
4. writes the trajectory's tree checkpoint set at the leg's end
   (:func:`woof.io.restart.write_tree_restart`), which is what joins
   this leg to the next, and mirrors the serialised prognostic state
   (:data:`woof.state_serialization_contract.STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS`)
   to the host for the filter;
5. analyses the members against a ``gpuwm-obs.radar-grid.v1`` file
   through :mod:`woof.da.radar_assimilation`, optionally adding
   :mod:`woof.da.hotstart`'s reflectivity nudge, and applies the result
   through :func:`woof.ensemble.increments.apply_increments` with
   ``refresh_diagnostics`` after it -- the shipped appliers, not a
   private write path.

A control trajectory runs beside the members and is never analysed, so
every number the report carries has a no-DA counterpart taken through
the same code.

**What a leg boundary is.**  A restart.  The join used to carry the
serialised atmosphere alone, so soil, surface, accumulators, held
tendencies and the radiation carriers restarted from the prepared
background at every analysis, for every trajectory, and the driver's
own record said so.  Measured on the card with the tree's own nested
fixture (``tests/test_da_cycle_join_gpu.py``): that join left arrays of
the parent and of the child different from a continuous run at the
same instant, and the restart join leaves none.  A nest that a
trajectory carries rides in the same set and is restored by the same
call; a nest born on a later leg activates at that leg's boundary
(:func:`woof.da.nested_forecast.child_born_at`), so its physics counts
its own first step as step one and its clock is placed on the tree's
tick lattice at birth.

**Deliberate simplifications, stated rather than buried.**

* Members share the deterministic run's lateral boundary conditions --
  the perturbation lane's documented setting, and the reason ensemble
  spread is suppressed near the rim.
* The observation grid is supplied per leg and is bound to the
  observation file by digest inside the adapter; a member's own column
  heights differ from that grid by the member's own perturbation, which
  is representativeness error rather than a binding error.

**Cycling past the end of one process.**  ``--save-ensemble`` writes the
leg boundary -- each trajectory's tree checkpoint set plus the analysis
increments the next leg has still to apply -- through
:mod:`tools.da_ensemble_state`, and ``--resume-ensemble`` starts from
one.  That is what a continuous nowcast needs: the next radar volume
does not exist when this one is assimilated, so the ensemble has to
survive the wait without being re-initialised.  The generation is
written at the end of the last OBSERVED leg, so trailing free legs stay
a branch off the cycle rather than becoming it, and the boundary-data
horizon of the prepared case is a refusal rather than a surprise inside
the integrator.

Nothing here is on a default route.  EXPERIMENTAL.

    An ensemble filter writes every field its OWN additive increment.
    Nothing in that arithmetic knows that a species' mass and its number
    moment are one object, so a cell can leave the solve carrying mass
    above the threshold with a number moment at or below zero.  The
    moment policy then refuses the leg that applies it -- correctly,
    because the scheme's own number initialisation is what would have to
    supply the missing moment and inventing an intercept here would be a
    science decision.  Measured on a four-radar hydrometeor analysis that
    is about two thousand cells of half a million; measured on a
    clear-air analysis over one radar it is a hundred.  Either way the
    cycle stops.

    There is a conditioning that invents nothing and that is the
    background's own:

    * where the background already holds that species ACTIVE -- mass
      above the scheme's own threshold, with a positive number -- the
      number takes the SAME multiplicative factor the mass took.  That
      is the background's drop size distribution carried forward, which
      is exactly what the perturbation half of this driver already does
      to the hydrometeor state, and it leaves Z proportional to mass
      rather than manufacturing a distribution;
    * where the background holds none of it, or holds it below the
      threshold, there is no distribution to carry, so the analysis
      declines the whole pair's increment in that cell rather than
      creating condensate it cannot describe.  Declining is not repair:
      the cell keeps exactly the background.

    "Active" is the scheme's own word, and it is the word that matters.
    Any positive background mass used to qualify, so a cloud the scheme
    had already evaporated to 5e-15 kg/kg with a droplet number of 5e4
    left standing was rescaled by an increment of 1e-3 kg/kg: a factor
    of 2e11, a droplet number of 1e16 per kilogram, above the 1e15 the
    pre-leg health gate admits for a number moment, and the next leg
    refused the state.  Below the threshold the scheme reads no number
    at all, so there is no distribution there to carry.

    The rescaled number is then checked against the health gate's own
    ceiling (:func:`woof.core.health.rule_for_field`) and for
    finiteness, and a cell whose result is not representable declines
    the whole pair to the prior.  Never capped: a number held at the
    ceiling is a distribution nobody measured, and the cap would be the
    silent version of the refusal it avoids.

    "Above the threshold" is the SCHEME's threshold
    (:func:`moment_mass_threshold`), not a single number: Thompson
    demands a moment above 1e-12 and Morrison above 1e-14, and using
    Thompson's for both left a Morrison run's smallest broken cells to be
    refused by the next leg instead of conditioned here.

    Only cells that would otherwise break are touched, so a healthy
    increment comes back unchanged and by identity.  Returns
    ``(increment, report)``; the report counts the cells rescaled, the
    cells declined for an inactive background and, separately, the cells
