# End-to-end 20CRv3 demo: fetch a real window, prepare it, run it, plot it.
#
# 20CRv3 is the reanalysis that reaches back to 1836, so it is the only
# source in this product that can initialise a case from before 1940.
# This runs the whole path on a small historical window:
# two three-hourly analyses over a 25x20 degree box, about 0.7 MB of real
# NOAA data (MEASURED 2026-08-16: 737,620 bytes for the 1974-04-03 18Z
# window below, fourteen files plus the recovered invariant supplement).
#
# Nothing here is 20CRv3-specific except the source name and the window.
# The decode is the declarative mapped route reading a PACKAGED profile:
# `woof prep --source 20crv3-cf` fills in the mapping, composition and
# provenance from the wheel and byte-checks them, so this script never
# names a mapping file and neither does a user.
#
# Two things to know before you read the output as truth:
#   * NOAA PSL's 20CRv3 NetCDF distribution is the ENSEMBLE MEAN
#     analysis, not a member.  For a member state use `--source 20crv3`
#     over the every-member GRIB2 archive.
#   * The source's published invariant height and land fraction are
#     bound to the fetched grid and times through Rust. Soil uses the
#     four published Noah layers; ocean initialization uses source skt.
#
