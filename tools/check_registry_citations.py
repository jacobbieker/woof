"""Re-resolve every ``file:line`` citation the physics registry publishes.

The registry's warnings and unimplemented reasons are its evidence, and they
cite line numbers.  Line numbers rot.  A user-visible MYNN warning cited
``woof/core/mynn_pbl.py:3601`` as the site where the snow mixing ratio is
zero-substituted; :3601 is ``pmz = np.empty(ncol, ...)`` and the substitution is
at :3637.  Its companion ``mynn_pbl_gpu.py:1260`` was wrong when it was written
and became correct only because a later commit happened to delete twelve lines
above it.  Nothing checked either one.

Existence is not enough to catch that: :3601 exists.  So each repo-local
citation carries an ANCHOR -- a substring that must appear inside the cited
line or range -- and the anchor is the thing the surrounding claim is about.
A citation that drifts by one line loses its anchor and fails here.

Four tables, and all four are exhaustive by construction:

``RESOLVED``
    citation text -> (repo-relative path, anchor).  Every citation whose file
    lives in this worktree must appear, and every row must still appear in the
    registry, so a stale row fails as loudly as a missing one.

``EXTERNAL``
    cited path -> the tree it belongs to.  WRF v4.6.1 is not vendored here, so
    those citations are checked for shape and for being DECLARED external --
    which is what stops a typo in a repo path from being silently downgraded to
    "must be somebody else's file".

``AMBIGUOUS``
    cited path -> the repo-relative path meant, for a bare filename that
    matches more than one file.  Which of two same-named oracle harnesses a
    warning meant is a judgement, so it is recorded rather than guessed.
    Currently empty, and an unused row here is a failure like any other.

``NAMED_ROUTINES``
    ``path::routine`` -> (the definition line, the files citing it).  For
    citations that live in source text rather than in the registry and that
    name a routine instead of a line, because a line number rots and a name
    does not.

``DRIFTED``
    citation text -> (repo-relative path, the anchor the claim is about, why
    the citation is wrong, who owns the fix).
    An ENUMERATED, OPEN defect: the citation resolves to a file in this
    worktree and the line it names does not say what the claim says.  A row
    here is not a blessing -- the entry records the measured evidence and the
    correct target, and :func:`check` fails if such a citation ever becomes
    correct, so the exception cannot outlive the defect.  Rows exist only for
    claims whose text is owned by a module this package may not edit.

Bare continuation line numbers (``module_bl_mynn.F:3872-3873 ... and :4618``)
inherit the last filename named in the same string, which is how they are
written and how they read.  A registry string that mixes two files therefore
has to spell the second one out; three mp=28 strings did not, and were
silently attributing WRF line numbers to ``woof/core/physics.py`` and to a
test module.  That is a registry-text defect, not a scanner defect, and it
was fixed in the text.

Usage
-----
    python tools/check_registry_citations.py

Wired to ``tests/test_physics_registry.py::
test_every_repo_local_registry_citation_still_says_what_the_claim_says``, so
it runs on every suite invocation.  Before that it was a script nobody ran
and its tables had rotted past the point of describing anything: 90 failures
against a registry whose citation set had moved on completely.
