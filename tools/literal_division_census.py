"""A146: every float division by a compile-time constant the compiler sees.

NVRTC's NVVM, targeting compute_100 and compute_120 (Blackwell) under
``-ftz=true`` (which CuPy appends to every ``RawModule``), replaces a float
division by a compile-time constant with a multiplication by the rounded
reciprocal: ``x / 3.0f`` becomes ``mul.ftz.f32 x, 0f3EAAAAAB``, which is not
IEEE division (a third of all ``x / 3.0f`` quotients land one ULP off).
Every NVRTC measured (12.9, 13.0, 13.3, 13.4) does it; compute_90 and older
keep ``div.rn``.  A source grep cannot find every such site: a divisor can
reach the division through a macro, a ``const``, an integer literal, a
constant-folded product, or a helper inlined with a literal argument.  The
compiler can.  This census compiles each production translation unit for
compute_89, where the same division survives as ``div.rn[.ftz].f32`` with an
immediate divisor, and lists those instructions with the source line
``-lineinfo`` attaches to them.  A power-of-two, zero or infinite divisor
has an exact reciprocal, so either spelling gives the IEEE quotient, and it
is not listed.

The chosen form, ``__fdiv_rn(x, C)``, reaches PTX as a ``div.rn`` whose
divisor is a register, so it is never listed.

A compute_89 immediate is not the whole set compute_120 rewrites.  A divisor
compute_89 keeps in a register can still be a constant on compute_120: NVRTC
13.4.92 constant-folds ``tgammaf(4.0f)`` there, which compute_89 calls at run
time, and a pair of constant divisions in the two arms of a branch can reach
compute_89 as one ``div.rn`` of a selected register.  :func:`rewrite_sites`
compiles the unit for compute_120 twice, under ``-ftz=false`` (where a float
division by a constant stays a ``div.rn``) and under ``-ftz=true``, and lists
every source line whose IEEE quotients (``div.rn`` and ``rcp.rn``) fall under
``-ftz=true`` while its multiplies (or fused multiply-adds) gain an immediate
with an inexact reciprocal there: the division became a reciprocal multiply.
Constant operands are counted, including one-write ``mov.f32`` registers
within each PTX function. An existing coefficient of the same value must
not hide another occurrence introduced by a reciprocal rewrite.

The reference is the same architecture (A174).  It used to be compute_89,
and NVRTC 12.9.86, the default ``recast-woof[gpu]`` compiler, compiles ``powf`` and
``logf`` differently for the two architectures (as separate functions on
compute_120, inlined on compute_89), so lines of noah, nssl2_nucond, shinhong
and thompson that hold no constant division lost ``div.rn`` and gained
immediates between the two and were listed.  Over every production unit under
both compilers, the flush-mode comparison listed one line that is not a
rewrite, a reciprocal: NVRTC 13.4.92 compiles thompson.cu's
``1.0f / (1004.0f * (1.0f + 0.887f * qv0))`` as a ``div.rn`` under
``-ftz=false`` and as an ``rcp.rn`` under ``-ftz=true``, its sign folded into
a new multiply by -1004.  ``rcp.rn`` is the IEEE reciprocal, so it is counted
as the quotient it is, and that line is not listed.  The flush modes can
still inline differently (13.4.92 compiles two of p3_device's functions out
of line under ``-ftz=true`` only; no line of it is listed), so a new listing
is read from the PTX before it is taken for a rewrite.

Every source is read from one tree, named by ``root`` (A193): the gate tests
pass the repository root they run from, and ``--root`` defaults to the tree
holding this tool.  The loader's own composition functions assemble each
unit from that tree's files, so a woof imported from somewhere else (an
installed wheel beside a source tests tree, the B200 bench shape) supplies
no source.
