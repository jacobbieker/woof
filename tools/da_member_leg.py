"""One member's forecast leg, and the process pool that runs several.

The cycling driver advances every trajectory serially: eleven fresh
models built and torn down per leg for a ten-member run.  This module
holds the body of that loop so it can be called either in the driver's
own process (the default, unchanged) or in a worker process (opt-in via
``--member-workers``).  Both paths call :func:`run_member_leg`, so the
concurrent arm is not a reimplementation that has to be argued equal to
the serial one -- it is the same function.

**Why processes and not streams.**  Measured on the live-fire-3 shape
(132x132x49, dt=15, 60 steps a leg, ``tools/da_probe_*.py``): a leg's
wall time, its CUDA event span and its cProfile total are all 5.02 s.
The leg is host-dispatch bound with an idle device -- Dudhia shortwave
alone is 1.94 s of a 49-level Python loop issuing thousands of tiny
CuPy operations.  Threads on non-blocking streams therefore measured
0.97x at width 2 and 0.83x at width 4: the GIL serializes the dispatch
and contention makes it worse.  Separate processes have no GIL and do
overlap, but saturate early -- 0.287, 0.400, 0.414, 0.419, 0.414 legs/s
at width 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 on a 32-core box, so the limit is WDDM
time-slicing between CUDA contexts rather than the host.  The ceiling is
~1.45x and width 2 already buys 1.40x of it.  None of that is a reason
to fold a member axis into the kernels: the device is not the busy part.

**Why this is bit-identical.**  A member's leg reads only its own state.
Perturbations come from a host Philox keyed by a SHA-256 of the field
and seed (``woof.da.perturb``), so they do not depend on evaluation
order; there is no device RNG and no float atomic anywhere in the step
path; and the analysis reads members back from disk in ``sorted()``
index order, so completion order cannot reach it.  A worker process
wires the model exactly as the serial path does and runs the same
kernels on the same inputs.  What changes between the two arms is
allocator history and process identity, neither of which any computed
value depends on -- every device buffer in the step path is
zero-allocated.  The identity test is held back with the flag
(``docs/da-ensemble-parallel.md``), so that it is asserted where the
concurrent arm exists.

**The leg join here is not the driver's.**  ``--member-workers`` is not
on the driver, so nothing reaches this module but its own tests.  The
driver joins its legs through the restart owner
(``tools.da_cycle_prepared.write_leg_restart`` and
``restore_leg_restart``: every domain, the physics driver's soil and
surface state, the accumulators, the held tendencies and the clock);
this worker still joins them through a host copy of the serialised
atmosphere and :func:`jump_clock`, the join the driver retired, and
takes the owner's join when it is ported to the driver's flags.
