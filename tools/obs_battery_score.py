"""Score one arm of one case against the observations, and write its receipt.

The battery's scoring engine, its registration discipline and its observation
readers all shipped as libraries.  What did not ship is the one command that
puts them together, so a shakedown could be run but not scored.  This is that
command.

Two modes, because the useful thing to do before a forecast exists is
different from the useful thing to do after:

``--read-only``
    open the run directory through the mandated science core and report what
    the scorer would see -- the grid, the frames, the column-max reflectivity
    range at one valid time, the station mapping.  Contacts no observation,
    computes no score, and is how the reading half of this tool is exercised
    against a real ``wrfout`` before the case's own run exists.

full scoring
    build the case's registration, read the arm, read the observations, freeze
    the station set against the arm's own terrain and land mask, score, and
    write the score file.

The tool knows no case: the case id, the init instant, the observation
directories and the run directory are all arguments.

**Which registration a score is bound to is an argument too.**  Pass
``--registration`` and the score is scored under the committed campaign
document, whose digest travels in the score file -- and a case or an arm that
document never registered is refused, because scoring a case the rule did not
register is how a case gets added after somebody saw its numbers.  Without it
the tool builds a single-arm document from
:mod:`woof.verify.obs.registration`'s registered defaults, which carries
``rule_status`` ``proposed-unratified``; that is the one-off path, and the
promotion evaluator declines to promote on it, by design.

**The registration is what the defaults are read from, not this file.**  The
leads reported beside the scored ones and the accumulation windows scored come
from the document the run is bound to -- its ``scored_lead_hours``, its
``spinup_policy``, its ``precipitation.window_hours``.  The first real
off-node scoring attempt is why: hardcoded lead and window defaults asked for
forecast hours past the end of the observation archive and for one window
where the rule registers two, and both refusals were the engine correctly
declining to score what it had not been given.  An explicit flag still
overrides; the default now conforms.  The registered coverage floor for frame
selection (amendment v2.1) is read the same way and handed to the reader, so
an upstream ingest outage at one lead is recorded as missing observations
rather than scored as a mask.

``--obs-archive-root`` is the other half of scoring somewhere other than the
box that fetched the bytes: the front doors record an absolute path in every
observation's provenance, and the promotion rule's integrity clause re-hashes
every one of them.  Given one or more roots, each source looks for its object
by name under them instead.  Given none, nothing changes.
