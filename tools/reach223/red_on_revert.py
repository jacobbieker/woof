"""Red-on-revert: undo each fix in place, run its test, restore.

Every entry is (label, file, old, new, pytest -k selector).  A fix whose
test still passes with the fix reverted is a test that is not testing it.

THE TREE IS THE ONE THIS FILE LIVES IN.  This module used to open with an
absolute path to the lane worktree it was written in.  Two things were
wrong with that, and both are the kind this repository has been bitten by
before.  It pinned a user's scratchpad directory into a committed tool,
so the harness ran nowhere else; and, worse, when the tool was carried
onto another tree it kept grading the ORIGINAL one -- reporting PROVEN
about source the caller was not cutting, which is precisely the
wrong-tree failure the battery's PYTHONPATH discipline exists to stop.
``parents[2]`` is tools/reach223/ -> tools/ -> the worktree root, so the
harness now grades whatever checkout it was copied into, and the binding
is printed below rather than assumed.

BYTES, NOT TEXT.  The revert/restore cycle reads and writes through
``read_bytes``/``write_bytes``.  ``write_text`` applies newline
translation, so on Windows the "restore" leg rewrote every LF file it
touched as CRLF -- the harness left the tree dirtier than it found it,
and `.gitattributes` (`* -text`) would have carried those bytes straight
into the object database, moving the source hashes the runners bind.
Observed here, at the 2.3.0 round-2 assembly, on this very file's own
first run.
