"""Is a 1 m LES actually viable in WOOF?  A measurement, not an estimate.

Four questions, one driver:

``footprint``  bytes/cell of the resident carrier set at an LES rung, and the
               largest box a given VRAM budget holds.  Feeds the extrapolation.
``cost``       ns/cell/step at the LES rung, medians of >=3 reps with the
               warmup discarded and a state digest on every timed
               configuration, so a transport that skipped work is visible.
``maxdt``      the largest dt that actually integrates, found by running, not
               by quoting a CFL formula.
``endurance``  thousands-to-100k steps at the working dt, with health,
               CFL and closure diagnostics sampled throughout.
``closure``    subgrid vs resolved TKE and the w spectrum, at a ladder of dx
               on ONE fixed physical box, so the closure's share is measured
               against resolution rather than asserted.

The case is ``woof.verify.cases.convective_boundary_layer`` -- the engine's
own em_les-shaped dry CBL (doubly periodic, flat, prescribed surface heat
flux, PBL off, km_opt 2 or 3).  That case is the LES oracle's counterpart, so
using anything else here would measure a setup nobody has validated.

The one thing this driver changes about the case is the SIZE of the
boundary layer: the shipped profile mixes to 1000 m, which at dx = 1 m would
need a 4 km box and ~4000 s of spin-up to develop.  ``_scaled_theta`` builds
the same shape at a chosen z_i so a 1 m run reaches statistically developed
turbulence inside a measurable number of steps.  Everything else -- the
forcing, the closure constants, the perturbation seeding, the topology -- is
the case's own.
