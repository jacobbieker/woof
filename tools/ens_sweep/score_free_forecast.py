"""Score a cycled run's free forecast with the rolling verifier's metric.

FSS(30 dBZ, 27 km neighborhood) against the observed composite at each
forecast valid time, plus >=35 dBZ column counts inside the echo mask --
the same two numbers ``evidence/da-demo/live-fire-3/
verification-addendum.json`` carries, computed by the same shipped
function (:func:`woof.verify.field_metrics.fss_distance`) so an
ensemble-size sweep lands directly beside the N=10 baseline.

The scored forecast field is the ENSEMBLE-MEAN leg-end column-max
reflectivity.  That is not an assumption: this script reproduces the
addendum's published frames bit-for-bit from the round-3 composites --
FSS 0.7274 / 1899 columns at +15 min and 0.7557 / 2146 at +30, with the
control at 0.2360 and 0.2719 -- and only the ensemble mean does so
(member 0 alone gives 0.7341 / 2062 and 0.7625 / 2296).  Member 0 and
the per-member distribution are reported beside it, never in place of
it.

The mean is the reason ensemble size can move this score at all: with N
members the scored field is an average of N composites, so N enters the
metric directly rather than only through the analysis.

Missing observations inside the domain are filled at -35 dBZ, as the
addendum records.

This is a *caller* of the scorer of record, not a second scorer.  It
exists for what it reports rather than for how it measures: the
per-member FSS distribution and member 0 beside the published
ensemble-mean number, which is the companion statistic an ensemble-size
axis needs and which ``tools/da_sweep_score.py`` does not emit.  Every
constant and the neighborhood derivation come from that module; nothing
metric-defining is written down twice.
