"""Does 1.5 km beat 3 km, and at which SCALES?

A single 27 km neighborhood cannot answer that.  27 km is nine coarse
cells across; almost everything halving dx buys lives below it, so a
null measured only there would be a statement about the metric as much
as about resolution.  So the comparison is a CURVE over neighborhood
size, not a pair of scalars, with the fixed-physical-distance rule held
at every rung.

Three families, because no single common grid can see every scale:

FAMILY A -- common 3 km grid (the headline).
    The 1.5 km composite is reduced to the 3 km grid by 2x2 block MAX --
    max, not mean, because the field is a column-max reflectivity
    composite and a composite of a composite is a max -- and both runs
    are scored against the same observed 3 km composite at half-widths
    0,1,2,3,4,6,8 = 3,9,15,21,27,39,51 km.  Every rung is exact on this
    grid for both runs.  This family CANNOT see below 3 km: the
    reduction destroys exactly that information, by design.

FAMILY B -- common 1.5 km grid (what family A cannot see).
    The 3 km composite is replicated 2x onto the fine lattice -- nearest
    neighbour, which adds no information, and that is the point: it is
    what the coarse run actually knows, expressed where the fine run
    lives.  Both are scored against the 1.5 km observed composite at
    1.5,4.5,7.5,13.5,25.5 km.  This is the only family that can say
    whether the fine run resolves structure below 3 km at all.

FAMILY C -- sensitivity: family A with block MEAN instead of block MAX.
    Block max can only raise a cell's value, so it hands the fine run
    more threshold exceedances, and these forecasts already UNDER-produce
    echo against truth (about 2000 columns against 2800 observed).  That
    bias runs in the fine run's favour.  The mean-reduced number beside
    it shows whether the reduction operator, rather than the resolution,
    is carrying the result.
