"""Separate the two reasons FSS moves when the ensemble grows.

The published metric scores the ensemble-MEAN composite.  That makes a
raw skill-versus-N curve confounded, because growing N does two
different things at once:

*   **Analysis quality.**  A larger ensemble gives the LETKF a better
    sampled background covariance, so every member is drawn from a
    better-corrected state.  This is the thing the owner is asking
    about.
*   **Averaging depth.**  The scored field is a mean of N composites.
    Averaging more fields smooths the forecast, and a smoothed forecast
    scores better under a neighborhood metric whose truth field is also
    smoothed.  This costs a member each and buys nothing a forecaster
    can use.

The two are separable because they can be varied independently in post-
processing:

*   Hold the ANALYSIS fixed and vary the DEPTH -- inside one N-member
    run, score the mean of a k-member subset for k = 1..N.  Every subset
    came from the same analysis, so the entire rise with k is the
    smoothing artifact.
*   Hold the DEPTH fixed and vary the ANALYSIS -- score the mean of
    exactly k members drawn from the N = 10, 20, 36, 64 runs.  The
    averaging is identical, so the difference is analysis quality alone.

Depth-1 (the mean over members of each member's own FSS) is the
statistic that never averages away with N, and it is reported for every
N with its across-member spread.

Subsets are drawn at random with a fixed seed and averaged over several
draws, so a curve is not an artefact of which members happen to be
first.
