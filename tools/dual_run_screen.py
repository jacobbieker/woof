"""The dual-run byte comparison, on a no-ECC card.

The 5090 has no ECC, so a bit that flips in VRAM produces a plausible
forecast and nothing says otherwise. Running the identical configuration
twice and comparing bytes is the standing corruption detector; a
mismatch is a corruption finding that stops the claim, full stop.

The screen this reproduces is the one the shipped 250 m demonstration
committed (`docs/superpowers/receipts/les/inflow-fetch/dual_run_screen.txt`)
and reports the same lines. That script lived in a measurement-wave
scratch directory and was rewritten from scratch each campaign, which is
how the same misclassification could be re-made twice; this is that
re-implementation, in the tree, with a test.

Three comparisons, because they fail differently:

* **wrfout bytes.** The forecast itself. Byte-for-byte over every frame.
* **final-state digests.** The run receipts' own state digests, which
  cover arrays the history files do not carry.
* **non-environmental receipt scalars.** The receipt blocks with
  `ENVIRONMENTAL_FIELDS` excluded -- wall times, device names, host
  paths and the like legitimately differ between two runs and are not
  evidence of anything. The partition is the one
  `woof.verify.cases.convective_boundary_layer` already publishes, so
  the exclusion list is not invented here.

An exclusion is never a silent drop. Every excluded key whose two arms
DISAGREE is printed, with the reason it was excluded, above the verdict
line -- so a reader sees exactly what the screen chose not to count and
can overrule it. An exclusion nobody can see is an exclusion nobody can
audit, and the difference between that and a hidden corruption is a
reader's trust.

**And a screen that compared nothing REFUSES.** Because the comparison
was total over whatever it happened to find, it was also vacuous on
nothing, and that was a hole wide enough to drive the whole instrument
through: seven separate arrangements -- two runs with no receipts, two
with receipts that would not parse, a receipt only one arm wrote,
receipts saved under different names, zero-byte history files, a receipt
carrying no digest, and the same directory handed in as both arms --
each printed ``DUAL-RUN SCREEN: PASS (bit-identical)`` beside
``final-state digests compared: 0``. On a card with no ECC that is not
a weak detector, it is a false one, and a false detector is worse than
none because the run stops being watched.

So ``PASS`` is no longer a flag any branch sets. It is derived from
:class:`Evidence`, the counters of what was actually compared, and it is
unreachable while any of them sits below its floor
(:data:`MINIMUM_COMPARED_FRAMES`, :data:`MINIMUM_HASHED_FRAME_BYTES`,
:data:`MINIMUM_COMPARED_RECEIPT_DIGESTS`). A passing screen states how
much it compared to get there, so "identical" is a claim with a size
attached to it. The sibling comparator ``woof.certify.dualrun`` closed
the same hole the same way, and the floors here follow its rule: one,
not a larger number nobody could derive from the artifact.

Exit 0 PASS, 1 MISMATCH, 2 the screen could not be evaluated. The third
was previously unreachable -- "there was nothing to compare" left
through the same exit as "the bytes differ" and so presented an
unevaluated screen as a corruption finding.
