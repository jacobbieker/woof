"""Reduce an ensemble envelope receipt to the block an acceptance band cites.

The reducer's first job is refusal.  Every member declares the SHA-256 of
every initialization file it consumed, and a member whose set is not the
preserved one is refused -- not warned about, refused, before any number is
reduced.  A member built from a different base state carries a deterministic
initialization offset, and that offset would be absorbed into the measured
spread and would widen it.  A widened band is exactly what this program's
standing rule forbids, so provenance is enforced here rather than trusted.

What it emits is a band-input block: the interval statistic as the
registration words it, the member count, per-member config digests, the
pair-score artifact digest, and the per-row envelope with its degeneracy
flag.  The block is labelled internal scope and records digests only, never
a retrieval path, because member artifacts are not redistributable.

CPU-only: no CuPy import on any path.
