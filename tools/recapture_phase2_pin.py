"""Recapture the phase-2 step pin for THIS card, with its readings.

The capture pins ``PIN_STEPS`` full dycore steps of the four
``tests/_phase2_pin.py`` builders, compared bitwise by
``tests/test_coriolis_map.py::test_msf_one_f_zero_bitwise_phase2``.  Any
change to the dry dynamics' arithmetic moves it, and the rule for moving it
is a reading beside the new pin: which entries moved, by how much, against
what.  Earlier recaptures were done by a one-shot generator that was not
kept; this is that generator, kept.

The capture is also a property of the CARD (measured 2026-09-17: an RTX
5070 Ti and an RTX 4090 differ in 25 of 27 entries at one commit, an RTX
3080 and the 4090 agree bit for bit), so ``tests/_phase2_pin.py`` keeps one
file per card in ``PIN_FILES`` and this tool reads and writes the file for
the card it runs on.

Run on the card the pin is graded on:

    python tools/recapture_phase2_pin.py                # readings only
    python tools/recapture_phase2_pin.py --write --readings out.json
    python tools/recapture_phase2_pin.py --write --new-card FILE.npz \\
        --readings out.json                              # a card with no file

Without ``--write`` nothing is touched.  With it, every entry of every case
is replaced by the current tree's answer on this card (the file describes
one tip on one card, not a mixture), and the readings JSON carries, per
entry, the maximum absolute difference, the RMS of the entry it replaced,
their ratio, and the count of differing words, plus the card, its compute
capability, the driver and the commit, which is what the ledger in
``tests/test_coriolis_map.py`` must then quote.  A card with no committed
file is refused ``--write`` unless ``--new-card`` names the file to create
under tests/data; its readings are taken against the reference card's file
(``REFERENCE_CARD``) or ``--against CARD``, and the ``PIN_FILES`` row to
add is printed.
