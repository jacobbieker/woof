"""Checkout entry point for the prepared domain-tree forecast runner.

The substance now lives in :mod:`woof.prepared_domain_tree_forecast`,
inside the installed package, for the same reason its single-domain
sibling moved: a ``pip install recast-woof`` must be able to run a forecast
without cloning the repository.  It is reachable as
``python -m woof.prepared_domain_tree_forecast`` and as the
``woof-prepared-tree-forecast`` console script.

This file still works, unchanged, as
``python tools/prepared_domain_tree_forecast.py`` -- the spelling in
``docs/public/FIRST-LIGHT.md`` and in retained receipts -- and is a
delegation, not a copy: the module object below IS the package module,
aliased into ``sys.modules``.

The registry route id ``tools.prepared_domain_tree_forecast`` is
unchanged: it names a route in the physics registry, not an import path.
