"""Run one cycling arm with pins the arm before it produced.

``tools/da_cycle_prepared.py`` binds a prepared case by three digests.
For the GFS arm those digests exist today, on disk, and can be written
into a plan.  For the HRRR arms they do not exist until the preparation
that makes the case has run -- and a plan that hard-codes them would
either be un-writable or, worse, writable with the wrong ones.

So the HRRR arms name a FILE instead of a digest: the
``public-wrapper-result.json`` the certified preparation writes, whose
``portable_bundle`` block carries exactly the three pins the forecast
stage must bind (``proof_sha256``, ``source_manifest_sha256``,
``prepared_content_sha256``).  This resolves them at launch and refuses,
loudly, if the block is absent -- which is what a preparation run
WITHOUT ``--wps-namelist`` leaves behind, and is a real mistake to make.

The assembled argument list is then pushed through
``tools.da_cycle_prepared``'s own parser before anything runs, so a
grammar error costs a message rather than a queue slot.  The pins never
reach a shell: they go straight from the JSON into ``argv``.
