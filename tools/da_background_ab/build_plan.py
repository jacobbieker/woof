"""Generate the GFS-versus-HRRR background A/B plan, arm by arm.

The experiment is one question -- does starting WaH from a
convection-allowing background make it better -- asked three ways,
because asking it once cannot separate the three things that change when
GFS is swapped for HRRR: grid spacing, background AGE, and whether the
first guess already contains storms.

    G-gfs        GFS 0.25 deg, cycle 00Z, f004..f010, init 04Z.
                 The published configuration, argument for argument, on
                 the case the published numbers came from.  It exists to
                 REPRODUCE 0.7274 / 0.7557 / 0.7655 / 0.7376 / 0.7316 /
                 0.7239 against control 0.2360 -> 0.3410.  If it does
                 not, something moved underneath the comparison and no
                 HRRR number from this run means anything.

    H-matched    HRRR 3 km, cycle 00Z, f004..f008, init 04Z.
                 THE HEADLINE.  Same init, same forecast age, same
                 hourly forcing interval, same grid, same eta ladder,
                 same physics, same observations, same seed.  The
                 background's AGE is held fixed, so what is left is the
                 model that made it: 25 km global with explicitly zero
                 condensate against 3 km convection-allowing with
                 QC/QI/QR/QS/QG decoded natively.

    H-fresh      HRRR 3 km, cycle 04Z, f000..f004, init 04Z.
                 What an hourly cadence actually offers a user, and
                 deliberately CONFOUNDED: it is four hours fresher AND
                 it is an analysis into which NOAA has already
                 assimilated radar.  Read against H-matched, not against
                 G-gfs, or the answer credits our filter with someone
                 else's.

Everything the three arms share is shared by construction rather than by
care.  The observations are one set of files, gridded once, passed to
every arm byte-identically.  The prepared cases are proved to carry the
same domain identity and the same vertical grid BEFORE any of them is
built (``build_case_inputs.py``) and their static geography is compared
after (``check_case_parity.py``).  The perturbation, the localization,
the relaxation, the seed and the leg schedule are copied from the
published run's own recorded arguments.

Two arms cost nothing on the card and say so (``needs_gpu: false``), so
the four-and-a-bit gigabytes of GRIB2 and the scoring do not sit on a
GPU that somebody else is queued for.
