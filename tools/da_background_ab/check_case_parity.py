"""Two prepared cases, one grid: measure what is the same and what is not.

``build_case_inputs.py`` proves the two arms agree on the CONFIGURATION
-- the domain identity the prepared cache compares by strict equality,
and the eta ladder that identity does not cover.  It cannot prove they
agree on the ARRAYS, because the HRRR case's arrays do not exist until
it is prepared.  This closes that, after the fact, with numbers.

Two things are measured, and only one of them is expected to be zero.

**Static geography must be identical.**  Both cases build their static
fields from the same WPS geography on the same host for the same Lambert
grid, so terrain, land use, map factors and Coriolis should agree
bit-for-bit.  If they do not, the arms are not integrating the same
lower boundary and "everything else identical" is not true.  A nonzero
maximum absolute difference is reported per field and the exit code
says so.

**The initial layer-interface heights are NOT expected to be identical,
and the size of the difference is a stated caveat of this A/B.**  The
observations are gridded once, onto the GFS arm's georeference
trajectory, and reused byte-identically by every arm -- which is what
makes the comparison an observation-for-observation one.  The price is
that a radar gate is placed in the layer the GFS column put it in, and
the HRRR column's layers sit at slightly different heights because the
hydrostatic integration ran over a different atmosphere.  The number
that matters is that height difference expressed as a FRACTION OF THE
LOCAL LAYER DEPTH: below a fraction of a layer the placement is
unchanged for almost every gate; approaching one layer it is not, and
the caveat becomes a finding.
