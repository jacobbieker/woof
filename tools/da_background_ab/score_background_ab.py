"""Does a convection-allowing background improve WaH's skill, and how?

Four questions, four sections, and a verdict that can come out NO.

**1. Skill, as a curve rather than a number.**  A single 27 km
neighborhood cannot separate "the storms are in better places" from
"the storms are in the same places and the metric cannot see the
difference", so the comparison is an FSS ladder over neighborhood size,
mean over the six verification times.  The method is the one
``tools/ens_sweep/score_resolution.py`` built for the 3 km / 1.5 km
resolution comparison -- ladder over half-widths at a fixed physical
distance, reported as a curve -- reused here.  Its family A/B/C split is
NOT reused and does not arise: every arm of this A/B integrates the same
132x132x49 grid (proved before the run by
``tools/da_background_ab/build_case_inputs.py``), so there is one common
grid, no reduction operator, and nothing for a reduction-operator
sensitivity to be sensitive to.

The 27 km rung (half_width 4, nine cells ACROSS -- a square SIDE, not a
radius) is the published one and is marked as such, so a reader can find
the number that lands on the same axis as
``evidence/da-demo/live-fire-3``.  The scored field at that rung is the
ENSEMBLE MEAN, because that is what the published figure scored; the
per-member distribution is reported beside it, never in place of it.

**2. The controls, which matter more than usual here.**  Every arm
carries a never-analysed control trajectory.  The GFS control on this
case grew from 519 to 1,162 storm columns against 2,800-4,000 observed:
it starts with no storms and never gets many.  An HRRR control starts
with storms already in it.  So a large part of any HRRR advantage may be
the background's own forecast rather than the assimilation, and this
section is where that is separated instead of being absorbed into a
headline.

**3. Spread, and the trap.**  A lagged or better-centred background
produces smaller innovations, so the filter needs less spread to explain
them -- and less spread makes the ensemble mean a smoother field, which
FSS rewards.  An arm that wins on FSS while collapsing is not a better
forecast system; it is a worse-calibrated one that happens to score
higher.  The prior spread trajectory across the six analyses, and the
observation-space consistency ratio
``innovation_rms^2 / (spread^2 + obs_error^2)``, are reported for every
arm so that reading is available rather than buried.

**4. The mechanism.**  If the first guess is genuinely better, the
filter has less work to do, and the analysis increments shrink.  That is
the mechanistic signature, and it is checked directly from each run's own
``mean_increment_rms``.  Increments that do NOT shrink while FSS improves
mean the improvement came from somewhere other than a better-centred
background -- most likely from condensate the background carried and the
DA never had to create -- and the verdict says so.

Everything except the FSS ladder is read out of each arm's
``cycle-report.json``.  No arm writes anything extra to be scored.
