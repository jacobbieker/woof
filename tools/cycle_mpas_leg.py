"""Run one leg of the cycle: anchor N -> analysis -> advance -> anchor N+1.

This is a STANDALONE process on purpose.  The MPAS GPU port lives in a
separate repository that pins woof by SHA and re-verifies the checkout
before and after every run, so the cycling spine cannot be a library that
port imports.  What crosses the boundary is anchors on disk.  That
constraint is also what makes the cycle crash-recoverable and what lets a
Rust DA engine read the same artifacts.

The leg, in order:

1. read anchor N (committed only -- a half-written anchor is refused);
2. apply ``analysis_increment.nc`` to the prognostics, if one is carried;
3. **if the derived block is now stale, rebuild it or REFUSE** -- an
   increment rewrites ``rho_theta`` and the carried ``exner`` then
   describes the atmosphere the model had before the radar spoke;
4. hash the rehydrated state IN THE FORECAST PROCESS and put it through
   the three-hash ingestion gate;
5. advance the parent by one cycle;
6. publish anchor N+1 carrying the ingestion receipt and the residual.

Two backends:

``--backend replay --history GLOB``
    A LOUD STUB.  It reads a recorded history series and emits the next
    frame as if it had been integrated.  It stamps ``parent_kind:
    "replay"`` into the anchor and prints ``REPLAY BACKEND: this leg did
    not integrate a dycore`` on every single run.  It exists so the
    spine's plumbing can be exercised end to end on a box with no GPU
    and no port checkout; it is not a forecast and never claims to be.

``--backend mpas-cuda --port-root PATH``
    The real thing, and it runs OUT OF PROCESS.  The port pins its own
    woof checkout by commit and refuses to replace a live woof from
    another tree; ``woof.cycle`` is woof, so a leg that binds the port
    in-process hits that import wall on a real card no matter how green
    its tests are.  This backend therefore does exactly what the front
    door does: it spawns ``mpas_cycle_bridge.worker`` through
    :func:`woof.cycle.mpas_bridge.launch` and talks to it only through
    anchors and segments on disk.  It was in-process until 2026-08-14
    and its tests passed the whole time, because a re-export resolves
    cleanly on a box with no port checkout and no card.

Exit codes: ``0`` published, ``2`` backend unavailable, ``3`` refused.
