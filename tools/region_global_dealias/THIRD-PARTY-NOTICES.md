# Third-party notices

This project is dual-licensed under MIT or Apache-2.0, at your option, with one
addition that cannot be removed: the solver is a derivative of Py-ART, so
BSD-3-Clause terms apply to it as well. The SPDX expression for the whole
project is therefore `(MIT OR Apache-2.0) AND BSD-3-Clause`.

`src/solver.rs` is a Rust port of Py-ART's `dealias_region_based` per-sweep
core (`pyart/correct/region_dealias.py`), mirroring its interval splitting,
region finding, edge accounting, and dynamic network reduction. The complete
verbatim upstream notice ships beside it as
[`PYART-LICENSE.txt`](PYART-LICENSE.txt); the excerpt below does not replace
it. Redistributing this project (in source form or as the compiled
`dealias.wasm`) means shipping that file with it.

### This is modified software

Per the notice above, the changes are stated plainly. This is **not** the
Py-ART distributed by ANL:

- It is a Rust translation of a single solver, not the toolkit.
- It works on flat `f32` arrays rather than Py-ART's radar objects, and it has
  no file-format, gridding, or plotting code.
- `MAX_EXTRA_INTERVALS` bounds the number of extra velocity intervals added for
  data outside ±Nyquist. Python's arbitrary-precision integers do not need such
  a bound; `i32` does, and without it a corrupt feed carrying non-physical
  velocities overflows the interval count.
- The merge loop selects the strongest edge with a lazy-deletion max-heap, and
  tracks shared neighbours with an epoch counter, instead of rescanning the
  whole edge list and clearing an array on every merge. Both were quadratic in
  the region count. Which edge is selected is unchanged: verified
  edge-for-edge against the original implementation on 86 real sweeps.

Neither UChicago Argonne, LLC, Argonne National Laboratory, the U.S.
Government, nor the Py-ART contributors endorse or promote this port.
