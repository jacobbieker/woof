# Vendored: `region-global-dealias`

This directory is a **verbatim copy** of the project's crate, not a fork.

## Why vendored rather than a git dependency

The house offline-build pattern: every Rust artifact woof needs is built
from a tree inside the checkout with `cargo build --release --locked
--offline`, so a build never depends on the network being up or on a
remote ref still pointing where it did. `tools/grib1_bridge/vendor/` does
the same for `grib-core`. The recorded commit above is what makes the copy
auditable: `git diff` against that ref in the upstream clone is the proof
that nothing here diverges except the one declared line below.

The crate has **no dependencies**, so nothing else came with it.

## What was and was not copied

Copied: `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `src/`, `tests/`, `test/fixtures/`,
`examples/`, `region_global_dealias.h`, and the licence and notice files.

Not copied: the WebAssembly build outputs (`dealias.wasm`,
`wasm-inline.mjs`), the JavaScript wrapper and worker pool (`index.mjs`,
`pool*.mjs`, `package.json`, type declarations), the browser demo, the
build script and the CI workflow. woof drives the **native C ABI**
(`bw_dealias`, `bw_dealias_rift_v1`) through `ctypes`, so the JavaScript
half of upstream is not part of this integration. Dropping it is a
subtraction, never an edit: no *code* file kept here differs from
upstream by a byte, and the one notice line that does is declared below.

## Nothing in here is modified, with one declared exception

`LICENSE-MIT`'s copyright line reads `2026 region-global-dealias
contributors` rather than upstream's entity name, matching the house
convention every other notice in this repository follows. Same rights
holder, same grant, same terms; the only difference is how the holder is
spelled. It is recorded here because this file's job is to make a `git
diff` against the pinned upstream commit interpretable, and that diff
now has exactly one hunk in it. Upstream will carry the same spelling
whenever it is next touched, and this note retires when it does.

Nothing else differs. The solver, the FFI layer and the tests are
the project's. Changes belong upstream and arrive here by re-vendoring at a
newer commit and updating the sha above,
`woof.obs.dealias_region.UPSTREAM_COMMIT`, and the Py-ART parity
receipt. `tests/test_obs_dealias_region.py` pins the ABI
version and the three structure layouts, so a re-vendor that changes the
contract fails a test rather than returning different numbers.

## Building

```
cd tools/region_global_dealias
cargo build --release --locked --offline
```

produces `target/release/region_global_dealias.dll` (`.so` / `.dylib`
elsewhere), which `woof.obs.dealias_region` finds on its own -- or set
`WOOF_DEALIAS_REGION_BRIDGE` to it.

`cargo test --release` runs upstream's own suite (45 tests at this
commit, including the real-sweep RIFT cases in `tests/rift_real_cases.rs`
and its pinned golden checksum).

## Licence

`(MIT OR Apache-2.0) AND BSD-3-Clause`. The solver is a derivative of
Py-ART, whose BSD-3-Clause terms travel with it and cannot be removed:
`PYART-LICENSE.txt` must ship with any redistribution of this directory,
in source or compiled form. See `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` for the full
notice, the list of modifications the port makes relative to Py-ART, and
the citation to use in published work (Helmus & Collis 2016).
