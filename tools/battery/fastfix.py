    python tools/battery/fastfix.py --base <sha> --head <sha> --format pytest

This is Lane A2 of the fast-fix lane (see ``tools/battery/FASTFIX.md``): the
step that turns "these files changed" into "run these suites", so a defect
can be fixed and published without waiting on the full battery.

THE ONE DESIGN DECISION, AND THE MEASUREMENT BEHIND IT
-----------------------------------------------------
Selection is by **direct imports only**.  A test file is selected when its
own source imports a module that a touched file defines.  No transitive
closure.

That is not a shortcut, it is the measured answer.  The 2026-08-13
test-estate audit prototyped both and reported:

* transitive closure: mean closure 186 modules, and touching
  ``woof/core/moist.py``, ``woof/fetch.py``, ``woof/experiment.py`` or
  ``tilestream/driver.py`` selects **441 of 591 test files (75%)**.  A
  selector that selects three quarters of the estate is not a selector.
* depth 0: mean closure 5.6 modules, 1% to 12% of the estate per touched
  product file.

and then validated both against a real defect rather than trusting either.
Commit ``6e9c690f0`` touched ``woof/core/moist.py`` and
``woof/core/dycore.py`` and broke two things.  Depth 0 selects 77 files and
**hits ``tests/test_pd_advection.py``**, the test that catches it.  Depth 1
selects 186 and depth 2 selects 276 **for no additional catch**.  Three
times the cost, same answer.  ``tests/test_fastfix_selector.py`` pins that
commit as a regression so the setting cannot drift on a hunch.

THE LIMIT, WHICH IS WHY THE ALWAYS LIST EXISTS
----------------------------------------------
The same validation found what this cannot see.  ``6e9c690f0`` also left
``tools/ftz_receipt/receipt/route_inventory.json`` stale, and
``tests/test_ftz_route_inventory.py`` is a MISS at **every** depth, because
it reads files rather than importing modules.  Citation checkers,
line-ending gates, release-note gates, case-token leakage and receipt
regenerators have no import edge to anything.

They are therefore never selected.  ``tools/battery/always_files.txt`` runs
unconditionally in every lane, and a non-Python change (a ``.cu``, a
``.toml``, a receipt) selects the ALWAYS list *and nothing else*, because
import analysis has nothing to say about those files and pretending
otherwise would be worse than admitting it.

OUTPUT
------
The selected files, **sorted cheapest first** so a red arrives early, each
with the reason it was selected, and an estimated wall time.  Durations come
from ``tools/battery/durations.json`` when it is present -- see
``--record`` -- and files with no measurement are shown as estimates so the
total is never quietly wrong.

    the files in a SINGLE invocation, and an invocation costs about 2.45 s of
    interpreter start, plugin load and conftest import before a test runs:
    172 stage-1 files as 172 processes measured 2,252 s against 1,441.68 s for
    the same files in one invocation -- 421 s, 29% of the leg, spent on
    nothing.

    Every row written by ``record_durations`` therefore carries ~2.45 s the
    battery never pays.  That is a rounding error on a 300 s file and it is
    50-100% on a 2 s one, and 100 of the 172 stage-1 files are under 5 s --
    which is exactly the end where ``_ordered``'s cheapest-first decision is

    red later than it needs to be.

    This reads the report of a run that already happened, so it costs nothing
    and it measures the arrangement the battery actually uses.  Sum over
    setup, call and teardown, because a fixture is part of what a file costs.

    WHAT IT DOES NOT MEASURE, stated rather than hidden: pytest attributes
    only those three phases, so COLLECTION -- where a module's import cost
    lands -- is not in the report and a batched row understates an
    import-heavy file.  It is still the better of the two numbers for the
    cheapest-first ordering, because the term it omits is smaller and more
