"""Run the Rust workspaces' test suites as one release-battery leg.

``tools/battery/cargo_gates.txt`` enumerates them, one package per line,
each with the expected-green contract it has to satisfy.  This is the
runner the battery invokes:

    python tools/battery/run_cargo_gates.py

from the repository root, with ``CARGO_TARGET_DIR`` pointing OUTSIDE the
tree.  It prints a matrix -- one row per entry, with the counts cargo
reported -- and ends in a single verdict line, the same shape as the
``[tiles]`` gates, because a leg that reports only an exit status throws
away the numbers that make a regression legible.

THREE REFUSALS, ALL LOUD
    * no ``CARGO_TARGET_DIR``, or one that resolves inside the
      repository.  A cut hashes the worktree-local renderer at
      ``tools/rustwx/target/release`` before it believes any leg that
      renders; a test leg sharing that directory can replace the binary
      the cut is adjudicating.  Defaulting to a scratch path would hide
      the mistake instead of stopping it, so there is no default.
    * no ``cargo`` on PATH.  This leg is not optional and does not skip:
      a battery that reports a clean leg on a box with no Rust toolchain
      is exactly the green-on-nothing failure the 2026-08-09 audit was
      called to close.
    * an entry whose workspace or package the manifest does not
      describe.  ``tests/test_cargo_gate_manifest.py`` catches that
      without a toolchain; this catches it again at the point of use.

EXIT STATUS IS THE VERDICT: 0 when every entry on the selected shard
passed its contract, 1 when any failed, 3 when the leg could not run at
all.  Those are different answers and the battery reads them
differently -- a leg that could not run has proven nothing.
