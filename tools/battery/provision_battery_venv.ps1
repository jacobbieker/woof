.SYNOPSIS
  Build a venv bound to THIS checkout that can run the CPU battery legs.

.DESCRIPTION
  The stage-1 and always legs need more than the base install: six
  stage-1 files import cupy at collection, the packaging gates fail loudly
  (by design) without setuptools, the high-res geog probe compares itself
  against rasterio/pyproj, and the MCP tests need the [mcp] extra.  On
  2026-09-01 three separate lanes re-discovered each of these gaps; one
  closing battery reported 16 failures that were all provisioning.

  Python 3.13 venvs ship WITHOUT setuptools, so it is installed explicitly.

.EXAMPLE
  powershell -File tools\battery\provision_battery_venv.ps1 -Target C:\path\to\venv
  Then, from a NEUTRAL cwd (never the repo root, which shadows the venv):
    <venv>\Scripts\python -c "import woof; print(woof.__file__)"
  must print a path inside this checkout.
