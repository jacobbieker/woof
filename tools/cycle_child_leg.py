"""One cycle's worth of child work: plan in, dormant domains out, legs run.

This is the child half of one cycle boundary, and nothing else.  It reads
the placement plan the spine computed from the analysis, renders the slot
pool as ``[[domain]]`` blocks the unchanged 2.3.0 spawn machinery can
execute, advances every live child through the leg, and writes one
receipt per child.

**The model advance is injected.**  ``run_children`` takes an ``advance``
callable, so the whole file is exercised without a GPU and the shipped
caller hands it the forecast driver's own leg runner.  That is not a
testing convenience bolted on: it is what lets the child-may-die rule be
proved rather than asserted.

**A child may die; the cycle may not.**  A non-finite state or a runner
refusal comes back as ``DIVERGED`` with the field, the cell index and the
value, and the child's slot is released.  Nothing is re-raised.  A parent
refusal is not this file's business and is not caught anywhere in it.

ACCURACY: the child plan is a placement decision, not a skill claim.  No
case names, no station names anywhere in this file (standing owner rule).
