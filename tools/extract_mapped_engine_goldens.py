"""Extract mapped-engine parity goldens from the REAL Python engine.

The goldens the parity battery holds both engines to are not authored;
they are MEASURED, by decoding the real staged agency bytes with
``woof.mapped_source``'s Python engine -- the behaviour of record --
and reducing each decode to the parity digest the battery compares.

Run it when the staging tree gains a source, and re-run it (deliberately,
with the diff read) when a decode legitimately changes.  A golden that
moves without a named reason is the defect the battery exists to catch,
so this tool prints the diff summary and refuses to rewrite silently
unless ``--force`` says to.

    python tools/extract_mapped_engine_goldens.py            # all sources
    python tools/extract_mapped_engine_goldens.py --source gdas-pgrb2-0p25
    python tools/extract_mapped_engine_goldens.py --list

Two KINDS of golden, because the engine has two subcommands a bare run
reaches and they measure different work:

``decode``
    one mapping over its own bytes, reduced to per-field digests, plus
    the inspection report.  Goldens in ``tests/data/mapped_engine_goldens``.
``compose``
    what a mapped PREPARATION actually runs (``MAPPED_ROUTE_SUBCOMMAND``
    is ``compose``): the composed canonical frames, the terrain/bound
    alignment receipt and the contributing-source records.  Goldens in
    ``tests/data/mapped_engine_compose_goldens``, keyed by REGISTRY
    source id (``hrrr-prs``, ``aigfs``) rather than by decode-row name.

    python tools/extract_mapped_engine_goldens.py --kind compose
    python tools/extract_mapped_engine_goldens.py --kind compose --source aigfs

The two kinds write into different directories and are never mixed, so
adding compose coverage cannot move a decode digest.

Every golden this tool writes DECLARES THE PLATFORM THAT MEASURED IT, in
a top-level ``measured_on`` member.  A golden is a measurement of a
platform and not only of a decode: measured field by field on a development machine
2026-08-18, the directly decoded fields hash identical across Windows
and Linux while the DERIVED ones -- the grid-relative wind rotation and
the relative-humidity derivation -- do not, because the platform's libm
produced them; the portable frame header digest is platform independent.  The
battery compares against a golden byte for byte on the platform named
there and runs the live dual-engine comparison at the same strictness
anywhere else, so a golden with no stamp cannot be scoped and is refused
by the battery rather than excused.

That also makes re-measuring on a different platform a deliberate act:
this tool names the platform change in its refusal, and ``--force`` is
what re-homes a golden to the box in front of you.

Staged bytes live under ``GPUWM_MODEL_GAUNTLET_STAGING`` (default
``~/gpuwm-model-gauntlet-staging``); a source whose bytes are absent is
reported and skipped, never written as an empty golden.
