"""Stage a scored A/B over cadence and radar count, on a prepared case.

Emits a ``gpuwm-da.sweep-plan.v1`` document that ``tools/da_sweep_run.py``
executes unattended.  Nothing here runs a model; this is the plan, and the
whole point is that every configuration is written down, validated, and
readable before a single GPU second is spent.

**Two axes, and the controls that separate them.**

Per-volume cycling and multi-radar are independent changes, and an A/B
that moved both at once against one baseline could not attribute whatever
it found.  Two further confounds have to be separated as well:

* a cadence that follows the radar has *irregular* leg lengths, which the
  cycling driver reaches by chaining one process per cycle through
  ``--save-ensemble``/``--resume-ensemble`` rather than by one process
  with one ``--leg-seconds``.  So there is a fixed-cadence arm run through
  the SAME chaining, and the difference between it and the single-process
  baseline is the cost of chaining alone;
* the inflation and observation-error settings were tuned at 15 minutes.
  There is a per-volume arm with them scaled (see
  :mod:`woof.da.cadence` for the argument) and one with them held at the
  old constants, so "we changed the cadence" and "we changed the tuning"
  are two measurements rather than one.

**Why chaining rather than a new driver flag.**  ``da_cycle_prepared.py``
already carries an ensemble across process boundaries, precisely because
"the next radar volume does not exist when this one is assimilated" is
the nowcast's own problem.  A cadence that follows the antenna is that
same mechanism with the leg length read off the feed, so per-volume
cycling needs no change to the cycling driver at all -- the cadence lives
here, in the plan.

No site names and no case names: sites, times and paths are arguments.
EXPERIMENTAL, like everything it drives.

    Built by constructing the real ``RadarAssimilationConfig`` rather than

    that will actually run and not against a copy of it that can drift.

    This is the check that would have caught a scaled observation-error
    inflation of 0.9129 on a per-volume leg longer than the tuned
    baseline: the filter refuses anything below 1 because deflating a
    stated observation error is a claim of skill nobody measured, and it
    refused it forty-nine seconds into the arm rather than here.

    WHAT THIS PROBE CANNOT ASK, and where that question is asked instead.
    The filter's scheme-dependent refusals -- a microphysics option the
    radar operator has no H(x) for, a clear-air arm whose floor nobody has
    read -- need ``mp_physics``, and ``mp_physics`` is not in this argv:
    it comes from the prepared authority's own experiment configuration,
    which this planner does not open.  Stating a guess here would check
    the wrong row.  Those refusals are asked by the cycling driver itself,
    in ``tools.da_cycle_prepared.plan_radar_assimilation``, called once
    above its leg loop before a member is perturbed (audit R-051).

    The ARMS are known from argv and are passed, so the refusals that turn
    on an arm rather than on a scheme -- above all a reflectivity or CWP
    analysis against a wind-only state vector -- are asked here.  The
    field set is ``woof.da.moments.DEFAULT_BASE_FIELDS`` when the step
    analyses hydrometeors, which is the scheme-independent floor of what
    the driver derives per leg, so this probe cannot refuse a step whose
    real field set the driver would have accepted.  The clear-air arm is
    deliberately left off: its floor question needs the scheme, so passing
    it here would refuse every clear-air plan on a missing ``mp_physics``.
