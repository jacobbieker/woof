"""Put the dealiasing engines side by side on one real volume.

Five arms of the observation front door over the same decoded sweep pack,
so every difference is attributable to the engine and to nothing else:

    off                            masking only, no unfolding
    vad-region                     woof.obs.dealias, the VAD abstainer
    region-global                  the vendored Rust crate
    region-global+refine           the same with the refinement pass --
                                   the shipped default
    region-global+refine+nobound   the same with the physical speed bound
                                   lifted, which is how what the bound
                                   refuses is measured rather than assumed

Each arm reports its wall clock, the three-state gate account, the
front door's own rejection counters, and statistics of the gridded ``vr``
field the DA adapter would ingest.  The gridded fields are then differenced
pairwise, per cell, because "the engines disagree" is a number of
observations and not an adjective.

A fifth section answers the couplet question directly: it locates the
strongest azimuthal velocity couplet in the volume from the data itself --
no site, storm or case is named anywhere here -- and prints what each arm
did to the gates in and around it.

    python tools/dealias_engine_compare.py --pack <sweeps> --out report.json

Nothing is written inside the source tree unless ``--out`` says so.
EXPERIMENTAL, like the rest of this lane.
