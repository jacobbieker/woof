"""Bit-identity of two directories of woof wrfout frames.

The question this answers is not "are these two forecasts close" -- there is
already a matched-comparison tool for that (``matched_wrfout_stream_compare``,
correlations and MAE against a CPU reference).  This asks the only question a
REFACTOR may be judged by: did the bytes move at all.  Two integration roads
that are supposed to be the same road must produce frames that differ in zero
variables, and "zero" is the entire acceptance criterion.

Comparison is over RAW BITS, not values, and the difference matters twice:

* ``nan != nan`` under IEEE comparison, so a value test scores two identical
  NaN fields as differing and a run that went non-finite the same way on both
  arms would be reported as a divergence it is not;
* ``-0.0 == 0.0`` under IEEE comparison, so a value test scores a sign flip
  in a zero as identical -- and the sign of a zero is a real difference in
  accumulated tendency that a later step can amplify.

So each variable is viewed as unsigned integers of its own width and compared
exactly, which is the same rule ``woof.core.nest_relocation`` uses when it
counts differing 32-bit patterns.

CPU-only by construction: it imports netCDF4 and NumPy and nothing else, so
it can run beside a live GPU integration without taking a byte of the card.
