#: HRRR hybrid cloud water ``CLWMR``; AWS S3 spells the same record
#: ``CLMR``, and has done as far back as 2025.  That is a **naming**
#: difference, not an inventory difference: same role, same count, same
#: bytes.  Treating it as drift would hard-fail a whole transport over a
#: spelling, so the role is what the selection keys on and either
#: spelling satisfies it.  A change in the record *count* remains the

#: silently absorbs a field appearing or disappearing.

#: Cloud ice is the other row.  HRRRv1 and v2 wrfnat files, published
#: before July 2018, index their hybrid cloud ice as ``CICE`` (GRIB2
#: 0/6/0) on the same 50 levels and carry no ``CIMIXR`` (0/1/82); the
#: archive's 2017-01-19 00Z wrfnatf00 and f01 indexes hold CICE 50 times
#: and CIMIXR never, the 2026-09-27 00Z wrfnatf00 index the reverse.  The
#: bridge reads 0/6/0 only from a file that publishes no 0/1/82, and
#: refuses a file that mixes the two.
