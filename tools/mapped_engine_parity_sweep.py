"""The mapped-engine parity SWEEP: both engines through the public doors.

The pytest battery (``tests/test_mapped_engine_parity.py``) holds each
engine to the measured golden through the engine seam directly.  This
driver is the other half the decode-vendor design names: it drives the
PUBLIC frozen entries -- ``decode_mapped_source`` / ``inspect_mapped_source``
routed by ``GPUWM_MAPPED_ENGINE`` exactly as ``woof prep``'s
``--mapped-engine`` flag routes them -- twice per staged source, and
compares what a caller actually receives:

* the parity digest of the returned frames (field arrays by SHA-256 of
  their ``<f8`` bytes, axes, shapes, missing counts, headers);
* the frame-evidence receipt (``mapped_frame_receipt``), canonical JSON,
  no mask needed -- it carries no engine identity by construction;
* the inspection document, canonical JSON under the battery's one
  enumerated mask (``decoders``: which binaries read the bytes -- the
  only thing that differs BY DESIGN);
* refusals: the same Python exception TYPE and the same message, on a
  battery of driven refusal cases (broken mapping grammar, missing
  input, manifest drift, corrupt GRIB bytes, and the real
  selector-identity twin the staging tree carries).

A second arm drives ``decode_composed_source`` -- the entry a mapped
PREPARATION actually runs -- the same way, and compares the composed
parity digest AND ``mapped_composition_receipt``, the receipt a prepared
run publishes as its evidence.

Wall time for both runs is recorded per source and per arm, so the sweep
is also the measured Python-versus-Rust decode and compose bench.

An unexplained diff is FAIL and exits nonzero; a source routed to the
Python engine on both sides (a declared capability gap: compose, GRIB1,
NetCDF) is reported as ``ROUTED-PYTHON`` -- identical by construction,
and counted separately so the summary can never dress a gap up as a
comparison.
