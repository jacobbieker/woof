"""Score a cycled run's free-forecast legs with the gallery's own FSS.

**This is the scorer of record.**  It reproduces the published gallery
numbers bit for bit, and the HRRR comparison, the verification ladder
and the sweep arms are all keyed to it.  Any other scorer in this tree
is a *caller*: it imports these constants and this neighborhood
derivation rather than restating them, and adds only what it reports.
``tools/ens_sweep/score_free_forecast.py`` is the one such caller --
it exists for the per-member distribution that an ensemble-size axis
needs and that this module does not emit.

That rule is not bookkeeping.  The two scorers once carried their own
copies of the same four constants, independently written against the
same published anchor.  They agreed at 3 km and only at 3 km: a
hard-coded half-width of 4 cells is the 27 km box at that spacing and a
13.5 km box at 1.5 km, so the copy silently meant a different metric
under the same name.  :func:`half_width_cells` exists so the derivation
is written down once.

The rolling verifier in ``tools/da_nowcast.py`` grades a *front-door case
directory*.  A sweep arm that drives ``tools/da_cycle_prepared.py``
straight at an already-prepared case has no such directory -- it has a
composites folder and a pile of observation files -- and yet its numbers
have to land on the same axis as the ones already published, or the sweep
answers nothing.

So this module does not re-implement the metric.  It imports the very
constants and the very function the renderer calls
(:func:`woof.verify.field_metrics.fss_distance`, ``FSS_BOX_KM``,
``FSS_THRESHOLD_DBZ``, ``MISSING_OBS_FILL_DBZ``,
``COLUMN_THRESHOLD_DBZ``) and reproduces
``NowcastRender.verify_numbers`` step for step.  If the renderer's
constants ever move, this follows them; if the renderer cannot be
imported at all, the fallback literals are used AND the fact is recorded
in ``constants_source``, so a reader can always tell which happened.

The neighborhood convention is the renderer's and is stated here because
it is the single number a comparison against published skill turns on:
``FSS_BOX_KM`` is the *side length of a square box*, and the half-width
handed to the boxcar is ``round(FSS_BOX_KM / 2 / dx_km)`` cells, so the
scored neighborhood is ``2 * half_width + 1`` cells ACROSS.  At 3 km that
is a 9-cell, 27 km-wide box.  It is not a radius.

**Two things a single flattering number hides, both reported here.**

*One scale is not a result.*  FSS rises monotonically with neighborhood
size and reaches 1 when the box covers the domain, so a single box is a
point on a curve chosen in advance.  ``--neighborhood-km`` repeats and
produces ``neighborhood_curve``; the published box is always scored
whatever else is asked for, and its numbers keep the flat key names the
existing receipts use, so nothing that reads this file today changes.

*The scored field is the ensemble MEAN.*  Averaging ten members'
column-max reflectivity smooths the field before the metric's own boxcar
smooths it again, which flatters the score relative to any member the
model could actually produce.  ``per_member`` scores each member's own
composite at the published box and reports the spread, so the mean's
number is never read without the distribution it came from.  The two
answer different questions and neither replaces the other.

Structure, beside skill
-----------------------

FSS answers "is the area in about the right place".  It does not answer
"does the field look like weather", and a neighborhood score can be *won*
by a field that has diffused its storms into one smooth patch of
above-threshold area.  Three diagnostics are therefore computed on every
scored frame and written beside FSS.  None of them replaces it and none of
them is subtracted from it:

* **object statistics** at :data:`OBJECT_THRESHOLD_DBZ` -- connected-
  component count, the area distribution, and the mean nearest-neighbour
  centroid separation, so "N objects against M observed" is a number
  rather than an impression.  This is the MODE family's first stage
  (Davis, Brown and Bullock 2006, *Mon. Wea. Rev.* **134**, 1772-1784 and
  1785-1795; Bullock, Brown and Fowler 2016, NCAR MET technical note), cut
  down to threshold-and-label: no convolution radius, no merging, no
  fuzzy-logic matching.  The separation statistic is the classical
  nearest-neighbour distance of Clark and Evans (1954, *Ecology* **35**,
  445-453).
* **radial power spectrum**, from the repo's own pinned implementation
  (:mod:`woof.verify.spectral`): detrend, Hann window, FFT periodogram,
  radial average.  Detrending before an FFT on a limited-area field is
  Errico (1985, *Mon. Wea. Rev.* **113**, 1554-1562); the aperiodicity it
  treats, and the DCT alternative, are Denis, Cote and Laprise (2002,
  *Mon. Wea. Rev.* **130**, 1812-1829).  The band ratios and the
  effective-resolution wavelength read as in Skamarock (2004, *Mon. Wea.
  Rev.* **132**, 3019-3032): the scale at which a forecast's variance
  falls away from the reference's is that forecast's real resolution, and
  a field that has diffused its small scales says so here immediately.
* **intensity distribution** -- P50/P90/P99 of in-echo dBZ and the
  histogram-overlap skill score of Perkins et al. (2007, *J. Climate*
  **20**, 4356-4376), which catches "right coverage, wrong texture".

ONE SCORING RULE COMES WITH THEM.  An ensemble mean is smooth *because it
is an average*, not because its members are (Surcel, Zawadzki and Yau,
2014, "On the filtering properties of ensemble averaging for storm-scale
precipitation forecasts", *Mon. Wea. Rev.*), so structure metrics computed
on the mean measure the averaging operator and not the model.  Every
structure block therefore reports the individual members -- with the
min/median/max across them -- and the mean separately, each labelled.
Reading the mean's object count as the model's object count is the error
this labelling exists to prevent.
