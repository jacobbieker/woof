"""Freeze the European radar site inventory the DA lanes plan against.

The collection publishes, per radar, its WIGOS identifier, its position, and
the list of moments and scan methods it serves. That is enough to answer the
two questions a campaign asks before it starts:

* which radars cover this domain, and
* do they serve radial velocity, or only reflectivity.

It is *not* enough to assimilate a polar volume from any of them. Two things
are missing and both are recorded rather than guessed:

**Antenna elevation.** The locations endpoint publishes a 2D point -- no
height above mean sea level. Beam height above ground is a function of
antenna height, so a site assimilated with a wrong antenna elevation puts
every gate at the wrong altitude, and the error is a smooth offset rather
than anything that looks like a failure. Probed 2026-08-12, the ``detail``
link each feature carries points at the WMO OSCAR/Surface station search,
which answered ``totalCount: 0`` for these identifiers. So the height is not
in this feed and not one hop from it, and this tool alone freezes every row
with ``elevation_m: null``.

**It is in the volumes.** ODIM carries the antenna height at
``/where/height`` in every polar volume, so the gap closes by reading the
product rather than the metadata: ``tools/harvest_radar_heights.py`` harvests
it per site and ``--heights`` merges the result here, position-cross-checked
per site so a height cannot be read out of another radar's file. A site the
harvest could not reach keeps ``null``, and
:mod:`woof.obs.radar_sites` refuses to hand it out for polar assimilation. A
placeholder would be worse than the absence: it would make the site *look*
usable.

**Elevation angles.** The scan strategy is per-volume metadata, not per-site,
so the list of cuts a radar runs is only knowable from a decoded volume.

Run it when the inventory needs refreshing::

    python tools/harvest_radar_heights.py         --table woof/obs/data/radar_sites_odim.json --out heights.json
    python tools/freeze_radar_sites.py --heights heights.json         --out woof/obs/data/radar_sites_odim.json

``--from-table`` merges heights into an existing frozen table without
refetching the locations feed, for the days the feed answers 429.

Nothing here names a country in code. WMO block numbers and station ids are
data.
