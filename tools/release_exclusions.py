"""Read the exact path exclusions shared by release assembly and public checks.

Only literal paths and a trailing ``/**`` subtree rule are supported. Keep the
first matching rule so a refusal names the same exclusion the builder applied.
This module needs only the supplied repository's RELEASE-EXCLUDE.txt; publisher
scaffolding under work/ is deliberately absent from a public source snapshot.

It also carries the private-machine rule both release scans apply to the data
files a wheel carries: the snapshot and export scan over the public tree
(``work/build_release_snapshot.py``, which the cut's battery and export run)
and the artifact verifier over the built wheel
(``tools/verify_release_artifacts.py``).

# ships every byte it holds, and 2.8.1's fetch route table carried "posting
# watch" plus the lab host that watched in 20 measured rows (A154); the
# repository configs and the MPAS sizing table carried the same kind of name,
# and one NetCDF terrain file a LAN address.  Measurement records name the
# measurement, never the machine.

# those files for machine paths.

#: ``(pattern, kind)``: the lab hosts' names (a development machine to a development machine and their
