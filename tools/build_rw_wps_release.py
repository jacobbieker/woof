#: and `woof.ensemble.state_sha`, none of which this wheel stages.  Their

#: `woof/obs/sources.py` is the seam between the ingest lane and the scoring

#: module that crosses it stays behind.  Nothing else in `woof/obs` imports
#: it -- `__init__` pulls radar_grid, superob, sweeps and target_grid -- so
#: the radar front door `woof doctor` checks for is unaffected.
# GOES window acquisition publishes cycle/ensemble manifests. The lower-level
# observation decoders remain available to standalone preprocessing.
_OBS_EXCLUDES = {"sources.py", "goes_window.py"}
#: The only two files of ``woof/io`` this wheel stages -- named
#: individually rather than by excluding the rest of the package,
#: because the package is the forecast executor's output side and the
#: allowed set is the small half.
#:
#: ``woof/doctor.py`` imports ``woof.io.nc_writer_bridge`` to report
#: on the NetCDF writer, and that check RETURNS A BLOCKING ``missing``
#: Check on ImportError.  So the two ways of leaving woof/io out
#: entirely both break something concrete: not staging it at all fails
#: this builder's unresolved-import scan, and allowlisting the import
#: instead ships a wheel whose `rw-wps doctor` always reports the
#: NetCDF writer missing -- on a wheel that BUNDLES the netcdf_writer
#: cdylib as one of its artifacts, and whose own suite states the
#: doctor belongs here precisely because a preprocessing install is
#: the one that needs to be told which bridge is missing.
#:
#: Staging the whole subpackage is what does not work: measured, it
#: cascades to 26 fresh unresolved imports, because ``io/restart.py``
#: reaches gpuwm.core.model/physics/microphysics/kf and
#: woof.supervisor, and ``io/wrfout.py`` reaches woof.runtime and the
#: physics runtimes -- the forecast executor this wheel exists not to
#: carry.  ``nc_writer_bridge.py`` is the seam that does not: module
#: scope is ctypes/os/pathlib/typing plus numpy, and its two internal
#: lookups (woof.bridges, woof.rustwx) are function-local and both
#: already staged.  ``__init__.py`` is empty and comes along only so
#: ``woof.io`` is a package in the wheel.
#:
#: ``classic_tape.py`` is the third, and it is here for the same reason
#: and by the same measurement.  ``woof/wrf_direct.py`` -- the
#: wrfinput/wrfbdy writer, which IS preprocessing and which this wheel
#: therefore stages -- imports ``ClassicTape`` at module scope, so
#: leaving the module behind fails this builder's own unresolved-import
#: scan and the wheel cannot be staged at all.  It does not cascade:
#: module scope is pathlib plus numpy, and its one internal lookup
#: (``woof.io.nc_writer_bridge``) is function-local and already staged.
#: It carries no forecast executor -- it is the shared classic-NetCDF
#: tape both NetCDF products write through, nothing more.
#: The woof.io modules this wheel stages.  An ALLOWLIST, and the
#: comment on ``_FORBIDDEN_STAGED_FILES`` below says why that is a
#: hazard: woof/io is partially staged, so "add one more name" is a
#: mistake somebody can make.  The bar for a name here is that the
#: module is DATA or GRAMMAR -- no CuPy, no netCDF4, no runtime, no
#: forecast executor -- and that something the wheel actually does
#: needs it.
#:
#: ``wrf_output_schema`` and ``history_selection`` joined on 2026-08-20
#: and both clear that bar: the schema module is a transcribed WRF
#: Registry table importing nothing but the standard library, and
#: history_selection is the ``[output]`` block's grammar, importing only
#: it and woof.explain.  What needs them is the CONFIG READER --
#: ``woof.config.load_history_selection`` resolves ``[output]`` at the
#: one load every front door shares, and ``woof.render`` reads the same
#: module's product-input table at module scope.  Without them staged, a
#: preprocessing install could not read a config carrying an ``[output]``
#: block at all.  Neither reaches ``woof.io.wrfout``: the Registry
#: metadata table the vocabulary is built from moved INTO
#: wrf_output_schema the same day, precisely so that reading a config
#: does not import the forecast output writer (and woof.supervisor and
#: netCDF4 behind it).  tests/test_history_selection.py pins that
#: boundary against the artifact.
#:
#: ``classic_product`` is the whole-file classic NetCDF writer the staged
#: woof.obs product writers open by default
#: (``woof.obs.grid_product.open_obs_grid_product``), so
#: ``woof.obs.write_radar_grid``, which the staged ``woof.obs`` exports,
#: needs it.  Missing, that call raised ImportError in this package.
#: Module scope is pathlib, typing and numpy, and its one internal lookup
#: (``woof.io.nc_writer_bridge``) is function-local and staged.
