"""The two [tiles] nesting shapes, driven through the PRODUCT FRONT DOOR.

WHAT THIS GATES, AND WHY IT IS NOT A PYTEST
-------------------------------------------
``tilestream/`` gates the streamed transport against a monolithic reference
inside the engine.  This gate asks a different and strictly weaker-looking
question that turned out to be the one that failed: can a USER REACH those
shapes by typing the command the documentation gives them?

    woof run <config> --outdir <dir>

Zero workaround flags, zero environment nudges beyond the card budget.  The
2.2 headline defect (task #196) was precisely that streaming worked and was
UNREACHABLE from every product front door, and the 2.3.0 re-cut exists
because two nesting shapes were still unreachable after that.  A gate that
imports ``woof.core.streaming`` and calls ``steppers_for_tree`` cannot see
that class of defect at all -- it walks around the door.

So this is a scripted gate in ``tools/battery/tiles_gates.txt``, beside the
other whole-forecast comparisons, rather than a pytest: what it compares is
a whole forecast against another whole forecast, it ends in one verdict
line, and collecting it as pytest would throw the matrix away.

THE TWO LEGS
------------
Both carry ``feedback = 1`` -- two-way nesting, the shape a user actually
runs -- and both are digest-compared against an all-resident CONTROL of the
same tree.

  LEG A   streamed parent, resident child.  Tree-wide ``[tiles]`` names
          mode ``on`` and the budget; ``d02`` carries ``tiles = { mode =
          "off" }``.
  LEG B   resident parent, streamed child.  Tree-wide ``[tiles]`` is mode
          ``off`` and carries ONLY the budget -- a per-domain table may not
          name the card, so the budget has nowhere else to live -- and
          ``d02`` carries ``tiles = { mode = "on" }``.

Leg B is the shape the round-2 receipt rider was written for.  Before it,
that leg streamed a grid and ``streaming_receipt`` returned ``{}``, so the
run tiled a domain and printed no line naming it.

WHY A CONTROL AND A DUAL RUN, BOTH
----------------------------------
The DUAL RUN (each leg twice) catches nondeterminism and, on a card with no
ECC, silent corruption -- it is the project's standing corruption detector.
The CONTROL catches the failure the dual run structurally cannot: a leg that
quietly declined to stream and ran resident matches its own second run
perfectly and passes.  ``[tiles].streamed_any`` in the run receipt is
asserted for the same reason and is the cheaper half of it: a leg whose
receipt says nothing streamed is a leg that proved nothing, and is FAILED
here rather than reported green.  That is the A/B-arms law -- an exact-0.0
delta means the treatment never ran.

THE BUDGET IS NOT COMMITTED
---------------------------
``configs/battery/shape_tiles_*.toml.tmpl`` carry
``VRAM_BUDGET_BYTES_PLACEHOLDER`` where ``vram_budget_bytes`` goes, because
that number is a fact about a CARD and a committed value would be a claim
about whichever machine happened to run the gate once.  This module
substitutes it, from ``WOOF_TILES_VRAM_BUDGET_BYTES`` if set, otherwise
from the free VRAM the planner's own probe reports.

INVOCATION
----------
From the repository root, as ``tools/battery/tiles_gates.txt`` says::

    LEG=A python -m tools.tiles_door_legs
    LEG=B python -m tools.tiles_door_legs

``GPUWM_CASE_DATA_ROOT`` must point at the directory holding ``WPS_GEOG``,
and the ERA5 forcing named by ``[case_data]`` must be staged under the case
directory.  Exit status is the verdict: 0 passes, non-zero fails.
