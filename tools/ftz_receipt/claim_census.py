"""Register every FTZ / subnormal claim in the public tree.

Scope is machine-defined: ``git ls-files`` minus the RELEASE-EXCLUDE globs
minus the vendored trees, tests INCLUDED.  A hand-kept list would drift, and
a sentence that drifts out of the census is a public claim nobody is
checking.

``--check`` refuses, each for the breakage named:

* a claim line nobody registered: an FTZ sentence ships that no curator has
  held against the receipt;
* a registered line that is gone: the register ships a claim the tree no
  longer makes;
* a registered line whose words changed: an ``asserted_token`` a curator
  wrote for one sentence goes on vouching for a different one;
* an ``anchor_sha256`` that is not the hash of its ``anchor``: a record
  edited by hand says one thing and hashes another;
* a ``site_count`` or ``site_count_by_kind`` that disagrees with the
  records: two branches that each register one claim both write the same
  new total, git merges that without a conflict, and the register ships a
  count one short;
* a token the receipt contradicts: the register says a route flushes where
  the measurement says it does not, or the reverse.

A site is anchored by its file and the exact text of its line (``anchor``,
hashed in ``anchor_sha256``).  Identical lines in one file are counted, so a
second copy of a registered sentence is still an unregistered claim.
``line`` is where this tool last found the site: a hint for readers that
``--check`` does not fail on.  While ``line`` was part of the key, a row
added to CHANGELOG.md above its claims moved about 20 records down one line
without changing a word of any of them.  Every branch that added a row had
to regenerate the census, every merge of two such branches conflicted in it,
and two branches that each added one row could merge cleanly and leave all
of those records a line short, red on the merged line.  A line that only
moved changes no claim, so it no longer touches the census.  A context
window was left out of the key on purpose: it would tie each claim to its
neighbours, and a row landing next to a claim would fail the gate again
with no claim changed.

``asserted_token`` binds a record to the receipt's verdict for its (route,
mechanism) cell.  Attribution across the five routes is judgment, not
mechanics: this tool never guesses one.  A record it cannot attribute is
written with ``asserted_token: null`` and ``attribution: "unattributed"``,
and the gate requires only that a token, once present, agrees with the
receipt.

#: mirror (num-traits describes IEEE subnormals in its own doc comments) plus
#: the read-only donor snapshot of grib-core and netcrust.  Only the
#: ``vendor/`` subtree is listed, never ``tools/rw_wps/`` itself, because
#: ``crates/mapped-engine`` beside it IS gpuwm-authored and its claims stay in
#: scope.  Measured at this tip: all 46 sit under ``vendor/``, none in
