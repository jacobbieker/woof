"""Replay ``oracle/lsmruc.csv`` through ``woof.core.ruc.ruc_land_surface_step``.

Fails closed on any nonzero ULP outside the pinned upstream residue, and on
any drift in the ``ilnb`` negative control.  Then it mutates arguments, in two
studies that answer two different questions.

**The control is the port's own output, not the fixture.**  This file used to
score a mutant as *killed* when its output was not bitwise-equal to
``oracle/lsmruc.csv``.  That is vacuous here: the unmutated port already
differs from the fixture in the 26 cells of :data:`UPSTREAM_RESIDUE`, so the
NULL mutant -- the port with nothing changed -- was itself "killed", and every
mutant scored as detected whether or not the fixture could see it.  Replaying
against the correct control turns 218 mutants / 0 survivors into 218 mutants /
30 survivors.  :func:`_null_mutant` is the assertion whose absence let that
ship, and it now runs first.

**Study 1, constant substitution.**  Every driver argument is hard-coded to
each distinct value the fixture gives it.  This asks "could the port replace
its read of this argument with this constant and still reproduce the fixture?"

**Study 2, the permutation control.**  Every argument the first study could not
kill is re-run with each case taking *another case's* value.  This asks the
different and sharper question "can the fixture see this argument AT ALL?"  A
constant survivor has exactly two possible causes, and only one of them is
unreachability:

* the port never reads the argument -- then every permutation survives too, and
  the argument belongs in :data:`UNOBSERVABLE_ARGUMENTS` with the WRF line that
  writes it before any read;
* the port does read it, and the surviving constant simply equals the only
  value the fixture ever lets that read see -- then some permutation kills it,
  and the substitution belongs in :data:`UNBOUND_CONSTANTS`, which is a
  *fixture gap*, not unreachability.

Both tables are exact: an unlisted survivor fails, and so does a listed entry
that no longer survives.
