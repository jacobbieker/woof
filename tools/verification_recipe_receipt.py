"""Execute the published reproduce commands, and commit what happened.

The reproduce recipe in the verification document is a claim that a reader can
run those commands and get a comparison.  As shipped it was not: the
comparator invocation omitted ``--start-time`` and ``--done-file``, so the
poll loop had no terminating condition and every ``forecast_hour`` cell it
wrote was empty -- which is exactly the metrics CSV certification refuses,
because the acceptance band is keyed by lead.

This tool amends nothing by hand.  It builds a two-frame fixture pair, runs
the *amended* comparator command through the production entry point as a
subprocess, and records the exact argv, the exit code, and the digests of what
came out.  The document is rewritten afterwards, citing this receipt -- never
the other way round.

    python tools/verification_recipe_receipt.py

The ``woof run`` half of the recipe is not executed here: the run of record is
a four-domain six-hour integration, and no fixture stands in for it.  What this
tool does check, through the production parser rather than by reading the help
text, is that every flag the amended line carries is accepted.  The receipt
says which half was executed and which was parsed, in those words.
