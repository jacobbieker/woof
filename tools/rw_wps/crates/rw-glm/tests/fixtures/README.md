A single, **unmodified** GOES-19 GLM Level-2 Lightning Cluster-Filter Algorithm
(LCFA) granule, used to pin the `decode_granule` mapping in
`tests/granule_decode.rs` against real product bytes.

### Why this granule

It is a recent, modestly-sized (~240 KB) G19 granule with a healthy mix of
flashes spanning the GOES-East disk, a non-trivial number of `quality_flag != 0`
(degraded) flashes (3), and `flash_energy` values in the ~`1e-15`..`1e-12` J
range that exercise the f64 scale/offset precision path in `decode_granule`.

The expected decode numbers in `tests/granule_decode.rs` were derived directly
from this granule's raw variables and attributes.
