//! The engine's own thread pool, and the one rule every parallel step
//! in this crate obeys.
//!
//! THE RULE: a parallel step decodes into PRE-ASSIGNED SLOTS and is
//! drained in document order.  Nothing in this crate may let a schedule
//! reach an output byte, not the order of a `Vec`, not which refusal is
//! reported, not the order of a progress line.  Every use here is an
//! `IndexedParallelIterator::collect`, whose element *i* comes from
//! input *i* no matter which thread produced it first, followed by a
//! sequential drain that returns the FIRST error in input order.  That
//! makes determinism a property of the data structure rather than a
//! property of the run, which is the only form of it that survives a
//! loaded box.
//!
//! The pool is the engine's own rather than rayon's global one: a
//! library that installs work on the global pool inherits whatever
//! thread count the host process chose, and this binary is also driven
//! as a subprocess by a Python front door that may already be running
//! several of them at once.
//!
//! THE CAP is measured, not guessed: the sweep it comes from is under
//! [`THREAD_CAP`].
