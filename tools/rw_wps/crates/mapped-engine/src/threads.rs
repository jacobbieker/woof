//! The engine's own thread pool, and the one rule every parallel step
//! in this crate obeys.
//!
//! THE RULE: a parallel step decodes into PRE-ASSIGNED SLOTS and is
//! drained in document order.  Nothing in this crate may let a schedule
//! reach an output byte, not the order of a `Vec`, not which refusal is
//! reported, not the order of a progress line.  Every use here is an
//! `IndexedParallelIterator::collect`, whose element *i* comes from
//! input *i* no matter which thread produced it first, followed by a
//! sequential drain that returns the FIRST error in input order.  That
//! makes determinism a property of the data structure rather than a
//! property of the run, which is the only form of it that survives a
//! loaded box.
//!
//! The pool is the engine's own rather than rayon's global one: a
//! library that installs work on the global pool inherits whatever
//! thread count the host process chose, and this binary is also driven
//! as a subprocess by a Python front door that may already be running
//! several of them at once.
//!
//! THE WIDTH is every core the process may run on (`available_parallelism`
//! honours the affinity mask and a cgroup CPU quota), unless the caller
//! names a count.  It used to be capped at eight, from a sweep of ONE
//! valid time's message decode, which stops scaling past eight because it
//! is memory-bandwidth bound.  That cap left a whole-series compose on
//! about 2.3 cores of work on a 16- or 24-core box: most of a valid
//! time's wall is serial work AFTER its messages are unpacked (assembly,
//! the field digests, the frame write), and the only way to put more
//! cores on that is to have several valid times in flight at once
//! ([`lanes`]), each of which needs pool threads of its own.
//!
//! THE WIDTH IS ALSO PRICED: before a series' first valid time is
//! decoded, the pool is narrowed to the widest one on which that valid
//! time fits in memory ([`admit_width`]), because each thread doing a
//! field's work holds up to one more copy of its field.  The price is
//! made from the inventory pass, which has read every selected record's
//! grid, so the first decode already runs at the priced width.
