//! `gpuwm_mapped_engine`: the decode engine behind gpuwm's mapped prep.
//!
//! The seam is normative in `docs/dev/decode-vendor-design.md` §3, and this
//! crate and `gpuwm/mapped_engine_bridge.py` both encode it.  What moved
//! here is DATA PATH: selector→record matching, declared-grid cross-checks,
//! wind rotation, record assembly, transposition, unit transforms, the
//! closed derivation catalog, canonical-frame invariants, missing-count
//! accounting, and the NetCDF variable resolution above the reader.  What
//! did NOT move is orchestration: authority snapshotting, manifest
//! verification, the decoder ladder, receipts, member grammar, CLI parsing
//! and exception-type selection all stay in Python, which is why this
//! binary never invokes Python and never shells out to another tool.
//!
//! Outputs: `frames.json` (schema [`FRAMESET_SCHEMA`], the compiled ABI
//! marker) beside `frames.f64` (one little-endian float64 stream, fields
//! packed row-major in manifest order).  Refusals leave as one JSON object
//! on the last stderr line, schema [`REFUSAL_SCHEMA`].
