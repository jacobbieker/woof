"""Extract mapped-engine goldens by running the REAL Python engine.

The goldens beside this script are not hand-written expectations: each is
the output of `woof.mapped_source.inspect_mapped_source` on REAL staged
agency bytes, reduced to the identities the Rust engine must reproduce
(per-field array sha256, shape, axes, missing count, source references,
the grid fingerprint, and the frame-header digests).  A golden that was
authored rather than measured would only prove the Rust engine agrees
with whoever wrote it.

Usage (from the repository root, with woof importable):

    python tools/rw_wps/crates/mapped-engine/tests/goldens/extract.py \
        --case icon-eu

Each case names a mapping in the repository and an input set under the
staging tree.  Re-running is how a golden is refreshed; the file records
the exact command and the input digests so a stale golden is visible.
