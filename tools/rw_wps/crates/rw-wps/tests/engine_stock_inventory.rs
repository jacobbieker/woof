//! The frontend's stock-WRF admission set agrees with the engine's inventory.
//!
//! `STOCK_WRF_INVENTORIED_MP_PHYSICS` is a hand-written id set; the engine's
//! `gpuwm/wrf_physics_inventory.py` is the producer, and the physics registry
//! now publishes per scheme whether an evidenced package inventory exists
//! (`consumers.stock_wrf_export.inventoried`).  The engine exports that as
//! `gpuwm/physics_consumer_export_v1.json` (`tools/build_registry.py`), and
//! this test reads it in both directions: the frontend never admits an id the
//! engine cannot inventory, and every inventoried id the frontend still
//! refuses is named below with the breakage that keeps it out.  The Python
//! side holds the same contract as a text property of this file
//! (`tests/test_rw_wps_stock_inventory_contract.py`); this is the crate's own
//! half of it, against data rather than a regex.
