"""Find dummies that are READ before they are WRITTEN in cu_ntiedtke.F90.

WHY THIS EXISTS.  `cutypen` declares `cutu`/`cuqu`/`culu`/`culab`
``intent(out)`` and then reads all four in its very first loop
(:1334-1337).  `cumastrn` passes cuinin's live `ptu`/`pqu`/`plu`/`ilab`
into those slots, so the incoming values are essential -- and a harness
that hands the routine FRESH arrays instead produces a capture that is
wrong on exactly the columns where the routine's own writeback leaves the
incoming values in place.

That bug shipped into the cutypen fixture and was caught only because the
NumPy mirror disagreed with it.  Nothing inside the harness could have
found it: the harness agreed with itself, and every self-consistency check
it ran passed.

So the pattern has to be found by reading, once, for every routine, before
the next harness is written.  Reading an ``intent(out)`` dummy before
assigning it is undefined behaviour in Fortran and the compiler is under no
obligation to warn; the code does it anyway, and it works in situ only
because of what the caller happens to pass.

USAGE
    python audit_intent_aliasing.py <path to cu_ntiedtke.F90>

Reports, per routine, every ``intent(out)`` / ``intent(inout)`` dummy whose
FIRST appearance in the body is a read rather than a write, and classifies
that first use.  A dummy first appearing as an argument to a CALL is
reported separately -- the callee may write it, so those need a human.

WHAT A FIRST-USE SCAN STRUCTURALLY CANNOT FIND
----------------------------------------------
A dummy written ONLY inside a conditional is essential in exactly the
same way -- a column that misses the branch keeps the caller's value -- but
its first textual use is a WRITE, so the scan above calls it clean.

That is not a bug to be fixed by a better regex; it is what "first use"
means.  ``cubasmcn`` is the case that proved it: all thirteen of its
outputs are conditionally written, the scan passed it, and it was found by
reading the routine by hand.

The third report below covers that class by looking at ALL writes to each
``intent(out)`` dummy and asking whether any of them is unconditional.  It
is a heuristic on Fortran block structure, not a parse, so treat a routine
it clears as unverified rather than safe.  Anyone extending this script
should know both halves are needed and neither subsumes the other.
