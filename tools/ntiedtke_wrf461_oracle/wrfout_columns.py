"""Build New Tiedtke driver-boundary columns from a wrfout file.

THE CROSS-FEED. run_nt_live.F90 already drives the byte-unmodified WRF
Fortran over columns dumped live from WOOF. This produces the same column
format from a wrfout instead, so the SAME implementation can be driven
from WRF's own state and from WOOF's, and the two compared. Identical
code, two states -- the mirror of the first experiment, which held the
state fixed and varied the code.

WHY IT IS POSSIBLE AT ALL. wrfout does not carry rthften/rqvften, so a
cross-feed would have been blocked on an input we cannot reconstruct. The
forcing ablation measured that lane at 0.017 K per 100% perturbation in
New Tiedtke, so it can be zeroed in BOTH column sets without materially
changing either answer. The one input we cannot get is the one we proved
does not matter.

EVERY FIELD HERE IS A RECONSTRUCTION, and reconstruction is where this
goes wrong. Two traps already found and closed:

  * WRF's T is DRY theta - 300 and THM is the moist one, under
    USE_THETA_M = 1. Verified numerically rather than read: the identity
    THM = (T+300)(1 + Rv/Rd qv) - 300 holds to 6.9e-05 K over the whole
    d02 field. Taking THM would have been an 11.2 K error at low levels.
  * Only fields BOTH WOOF and WRF write are used. WOOF's wrfout carries
    77 variables against WRF's 203 and has no DNW/DN/C1F/C2F/P_HYD/THM --
    so dnw and dn are derived from ZNW, which both carry. That is what
    makes the round-trip guard possible: the same code path can be run on
    WOOF's own wrfout and checked against the live dump, which is the
    only way to know the reconstruction is right.

Formulas are WRF's own, from the 4.8.0 tree:

                 (note dz8w(kte) = 0 -- WRF's choice, replicated)
