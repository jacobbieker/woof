# Build and run the New Tiedtke (cu_physics = 16) cumulus oracle against the
# byte-unmodified WRF v4.6.1 sources.
#
# THE FILE SET IS THREE FILES.  New Tiedtke has no WRF framework dependency
# at all -- no wrf_error_fatal, no wrf_debug, no registry, no
# module_state_description.  `grep -E '^\s*use '` over the two scheme files
# lists ccpp_kind_types, cu_ntiedtke and cu_ntiedtke_common and nothing else,
# and cu_ntiedtke_common lives inside cu_ntiedtke.F90.  So unlike the
# Grell-Freitas oracle -- which had to pull in module_gfs_machine and
# module_gfs_physcons for its constants -- this harness links the scheme and
# stops.  `nm -u` on the objects is the receipt: nothing but libm and
# libgfortran.
#
# WHY -DRWORDSIZE=4 IS NOT OPTIONAL, and is the single most dangerous line in
# this script.  v4.6.1's phys/ccpp_kind_types.F reads
#
#     #if ( RWORDSIZE == 4 )
#        integer, parameter :: kind_phys = selected_real_kind(6)
#     #else
#        integer, parameter :: kind_phys = selected_real_kind(12)
#     #endif
#
# cpp evaluates an UNDEFINED identifier as 0, and 0 == 4 is false, so a build
# that forgets the define takes the DOUBLE branch.  It compiles clean, it
# links clean, and it writes a double-precision oracle that looks entirely
# plausible -- against which a correct float32 port would fail every bitwise
# gate, and the failure would read as a porting bug.  WRF itself sets this
# from configure.wrf (RWORDSIZE = 4 on any default, non-`-r8` build), which
# is why the file never looks dangerous in situ.
#
# Note this file is one of the few that is NOT byte-identical between v4.6.1
# and v4.8.0: 4.8.0 respells the guard as `#ifndef DOUBLE_PRECISION`.  Both
# resolve to single on a default build, so the ANSWER is the same, but the
# digest is not and the define that reaches it is not.  Pin the 4.6.1 bytes.
#
# run_cu_ntiedtke.F90 refuses to run if kind(1.0_kind_phys) /= 4, so the
# define is belt AND braces.
#
# libmvec: same guard as the Grell-Freitas, YSU and Shin-Hong oracles.  The
# reference is built at -O0 and this script FAILS if any _ZGV* symbol appears
# in an -O0 object.

# phys/physics_mmm/ -- the CCPP/MPAS-shared physics directory -- and NOT in
# phys/ beside module_cu_ntiedtke.F.  That split is present in v4.6.1; it is
# not a later reorganisation, and the 533-line phys/module_cu_ntiedtke.F is a
# thin driver, not the scheme.  Do not size this port from the wrapper.
#
# Digests verified 2026-08-28 two ways: read from this workstation's WRF tree
# and independently fetched from wrf-model/WRF at tag v4.6.1.  The two scheme
# files are byte-identical between v4.6.1 and v4.8.0, so a screening run on a
# 4.8.0 build exercises the same physics as this parity target.

  #
  # It is NOT byte-identical between v4.6.1 and v4.8.0, unlike the two
  # scheme files: 4.8.0 renames GFSCHEME to GFLSCHEME and swaps
  # module_cu_gf_wrfdrv for module_cu_gfl.  The FOLD BLOCK is identical
  # in both -- diffed, not assumed -- but the file is not, so reading the
  # fold off this workstation's 4.8.0 tree was luck rather than method.
  #
  # QUOTED 2026-08-29 from the file that verifies against this digest, so
  # the transcription rests on a quotation rather than on an inference
  # about which version was read (asked for by review, whose point was
  # that the conclusion had survived while the reasoning under it moved):
  #
  #   :867  if(cu_physics == G3SCHEME .or. cu_physics == NTIEDTKESCHEME) then
  #   ...
  #   :879        RTHFTEN(i,k,j)=(RTHFTEN(i,k,j)+RTHRATEN(i,k,j) &
  #   :880                       +RTHBLTEN(i,k,j))*pi(i,k,j)
  #   :881        RQVFTEN(i,k,j)=RQVFTEN(i,k,j)+RQVBLTEN(i,k,j)
  #
  # The `* pi` is there, on the theta lane only.  The guard names exactly
  # two schemes and Kain-Fritsch is not one of them, which is the whole
  # reason CUMULUS_ADVECTIVE_FORCING_SCHEMES is {3, 16} and excludes 1.
  # Note v4.6.1 spells it G3SCHEME where 4.8.0 says GFLSCHEME -- the
  # rename above -- so this quotation could not have been taken off the
  # 4.8.0 tree without the same version question reopening.
  #
  # PROVENANCE, corrected: this digest is not an upstream fetch. It is
  # ~/WRF+L on this box, which is a v4.6.1 tree and matches three of the
  # four pins outright. Earlier searches looked only at ~/WRF (4.8.0) and
  # concluded no v4.6.1 source was present.
