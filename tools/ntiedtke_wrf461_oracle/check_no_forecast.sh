# Refuse if a forecast is running.  RUN THIS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE EVERY COMMIT.
#
# WHY, and the part that is easy to get half-right.  The project rules say "never
# git commit -- or edit tracked source -- while a forecast is running".  The
# obvious reading is that EDITING is the hazard and a commit is incidental.
# That reading is wrong and it cost a run.
#
# woof/prepared_domain_tree_forecast.py:1374 `_runtime_source_identity()`
# returns
#
#     gpuwm_version, git_commit, git_tree, source_sha256
#
# where source_sha256 covers five files (core/model.py, core/nest.py,
# core/microphysics_transition.py, core/kernels/nest_microphysics.cu, and
# prepared_domain_tree_forecast.py itself).  The identity is captured at
# start and RE-CHECKED AT COMPLETION (:2307); a mismatch raises
#
#     RuntimeError("forecast implementation changed during execution")
#
# git_commit and git_tree are in that mapping.  So ANY commit -- including a
# documentation-only commit touching no source at all -- changes the identity
# and kills the run AT THE FINISH LINE, after all the compute is spent.
#
# MEASURED, 2026-08-29: seven commits were made during a 51-minute
# tc_hafs_kf3 run.  The run was recovered only by branching the work
# aside and `git reset --soft` back to the commit HEAD held at launch; it
# then completed SUCCESS.  Nothing in the tree would have caught it.
#
# Checking once per session is NOT enough -- a forecast can start at any
# time, and one did.  Check immediately before each commit.

# BLIND SPOT FOUND 2026-08-29, live, at 87% of a 14-hour run.
#
# This script matched ONLY the command line.  A forecast launched through a
# wrapper -- a script that does `from woof.prepared_domain_tree_forecast
# import main` and calls it -- puts none of the three names on its own
# command line, so the match failed and the gate printed "safe to commit"
# over a live run.  The process was python.exe and WAS returned by the
# query; only the pattern missed.  No commit actually landed inside that
# window, but by sequencing rather than by this script.
#
# TWO ARMS NOW, AND BOTH ARE NEEDED.  They are not two chances at the same
# catch -- each is unsound alone and each covers the other's blind spot.
# Do not delete the "redundant" one:
#
#   * SYNTACTIC (command line).  Same class of fragility that just failed,
#     and the ONLY arm that covers STARTUP: a run pays tens of seconds of
#     NVRTC compilation before its first step, and nothing writes
#     progress.jsonl in that window.  A behavioural check alone is blind
#     for a minute-plus at every launch.
#
#   * BEHAVIOURAL (a recently-written progress.jsonl).  Observes a forecast
#     DOING something instead of inferring it from how it was spelled --
#     any wrapper, any invocation shape, any future entry point.  Its
#     failure mode is a stale file inside the window, which refuses when it
#     needn't: the safe direction.
#
# The structurally correct fix is for the RUNNER to declare itself with a
# lock file, so this stops guessing from outside.  Not done: it would edit
# prepared_domain_tree_forecast.py, one of the five files whose
# source_sha256 the run identity hashes, on a runner a live campaign is
# using.  Recorded here as the shape this wants if it fails a third time.
