"""Emit the WRF-side node bundle for ONE battery experiment config.

The battery's third and fourth arms are stock WRF v4.6.1 on the nodes and
its one-ULP twin (spec sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.4).  Two rules govern how their
inputs come to exist, and both are about not writing the same physics
twice:

* **The mirrored namelist is GENERATED from the battery config, never
  hand-written beside it** (spec section 6.3).  The generator is
  :func:`woof.hrrr_route_inputs.render_namelist_input`, the same renderer
  the HRRR route uses for its own native/stock pair -- so a physics switch
  that differs between the two arms is impossible by construction rather
  than by review, and a config the route refuses is refused HERE too,
  before a node is booked.
* **The twin is the existing instrument.**  ``tools/n5s/perturb_ulp.py``
  applies exactly one documented floating-point ULP to a ``wrfinput``
  field and writes its own ``perturbation.json``; this tool emits the
  command rather than a second perturbation implementation.

Everything this writes is text: namelists, a plan document, and a launch
script.  It runs no forecast, contacts no node, and requires no GPU -- the
point is that the whole node campaign can be composed, reviewed and
committed before either venue is free.

Wall-clock projections come from the committed speed anchors
(``docs/public/receipts/obsbattery/B4-SPEED-ANCHORS.json``), which carries
the status of each anchor's evidence; this tool never restates a speed
number of its own.
