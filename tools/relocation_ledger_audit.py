"""Audit a run's relocation receipts: is every row an INTENDED decision?

A moving-nest run's evidence is its ledger.  Counting the rows says the
run finished; it does not say the run was *right*.  This walks the
ledger and checks the invariants the subsystem claims, so "the run was
clean" becomes a statement somebody can re-derive from the artifact
rather than a memory of watching it go.

What it checks, and why each one exists:

* **Placement chain continuity.**  Every move's ``placement_from`` must
  be the previous move's ``placement_to`` for that grid.  A gap means a
  placement changed outside the runner, which is the failure mode the
  segment/generation bookkeeping exists to make impossible.
* **The caps were respected.**  Every executed shift within
  ``max_move_parent_cells``, every containment slide within its own cap,
  and every move of either kind at or above ``min_overlap_fraction``.
  A shift past the cap is the clamp not firing.
* **The earth-fixed compensation is arithmetic, not aspiration.**  On
  every containment row, each descendant's placement change must equal
  ``-shift x ratio`` exactly, and the row must carry
  ``state_carried_bitwise``.  This is the ledger half of the claim
  ``woof.core.nest_relocation`` makes in code.
* **Donor alignment and parent invariance passed on every row**, and
  every mid-tree move re-grounded every descendant.
* **The tracker's decisions are the configured ones.**  Only decisions
  in the expected set appear, and the two suppressions that mean
  something went wrong (``no-signal``, ``suppressed:at-parent-edge``)
  are reported by count and time rather than buried.
* **The track is a track.**  Successive centroids are compared against
  what the configured cadence and cap physically allow, so a centroid
  that teleports is visible.  A tracker that oscillates -- proposing
  +di then -di repeatedly -- is counted separately, because that is the
  hysteresis failing rather than the storm moving.

Usage::

    python tools/relocation_ledger_audit.py path/to/relocation_receipts.json

Exit status is 0 when every invariant holds and 1 when any fails, so it
can gate.  Paths are arguments: nothing here knows about any one box.
