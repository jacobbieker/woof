"""Rebuild one observation file from an already-decoded sweep pack.

``tools/obs_radar_grid_build.py`` is the production spine and owns the
whole chain -- fetch, decode, verify, superob, grid, receipt.  This tool
owns only the tail of it::

    (pack already on disk) -> superob -> grid -> receipt

and it exists for one reason: **re-deriving an observation product from
the same bytes after the gridding code has changed.**  When a new
observation type is added to the writer, every file built before it
lacks the new variables, and the only way to give an old case the new
product without changing the observation itself is to run the new code
over the identical decoded volume.

Going back through the fetch and decode stages to do that would be
wrong twice over.  It needs the network, so the reconstruction stops
being reproducible; and it re-runs a decoder whose output is not
guaranteed to be the byte-for-byte pack the original run consumed, so
the reconstruction would silently be of a *different* volume.  Reading
the retained pack removes both risks: the input to the superobber is
provably the same array of gates the first build used, so any difference
in the output is attributable to the gridding code and to nothing else.

Nothing here re-implements the superobber, the merge or the writer.  It
calls :func:`woof.obs.superob.superob_volume`,
:func:`woof.obs.superob.merge_contributions` and
:func:`woof.obs.radar_grid.write_radar_grid`, in that order, with the
same :class:`~woof.obs.superob.SuperobParams` the original build
recorded -- which is why ``--max-range-km`` is REQUIRED here while the
production builder defaults it.  A reconstruction that quietly picked a
different range authority than the file it is replacing would produce a
plausible, wrong answer, and the range authority is exactly the value
the production builder was written to stop disagreeing about.

The written provenance says ``rebuilt_from_pack`` and carries the
original build record's volume identity forward, so a reader can always
tell a reconstruction from a first build and can still name the S3
object the gates came from.

EXPERIMENTAL, like the rest of this lane.  No case names belong here:
sites, times, packs and grids are arguments.
