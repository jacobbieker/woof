"""Lift ``private ::`` to ``public ::`` in the pinned WRF v4.6.1 Noah-MP module.

Every per-leaf oracle in this directory has to call a module procedure that
``phys/module_sf_noahmplsm.F`` declares ``private``.  Copying the routine out
of the module would change what the compiler sees, so the accessibility
statements are flipped and nothing else -- and that claim is made runnable
rather than asserted.

One script, four lanes
----------------------
The BARE_FLUX, VEGE_FLUX and PHENOLOGY/PRECIP_HEAT lanes each wrote their own
copy of this, because none of them could see the others.  Run against the
pinned pristine source the three produced a **byte-identical** patched file
(sha256 ``bfdc0f3632cd30b87208b26a309c533b12d9bc2a39d1a36e9165ecf90d0a12c3``),
as does ``snow_visibility_patch.py``, so they are one script with three CLI
surfaces.  This is that script; it carries the union of the three, and no
lane's check was dropped:

``--check``
    Re-derives the patched text from the pristine text and asserts that the
    line count is unchanged, that every differing line is exactly a
    ``private :: X`` -> ``public  :: X`` rewrite of the same symbol *at the
    same byte length*, and that the changed-line count equals the number of
    symbols lifted.

``--emit-symbols``
    Prints the lifted symbols, so a reviewer can see the routine under test in
    the list.

``--require-symbol NAME``
    Fails unless NAME was lifted, so the routine under test cannot silently
    fall out of scope.

``--mutate NAME``
    Negative control.  Applies an *additional* source change on top of the
    visibility lift, so that ``--check`` and the object-code comparison must
    both fail.  Without this, "the checks pass" is not evidence they can fail.

``--self-test``
    Negative control for the checker itself, on a synthetic three-line source:
    a renamed symbol, an edited body, a dropped line and a width change must
    each be rejected.

Two spellings, both correct, and which one this is
-------------------------------------------------
``private`` is 7 characters and ``public`` is 6, so a rewrite either pads to
``public  ::`` (this script, and the four lanes above) or lets the line shrink
by one byte to ``public ::`` (``make_public_radiation.py`` and the tree's own
``patches/noahmp-lsm-leaf-visibility.patch``, which agree with each other byte
for byte at sha256 ``3cd3690d...``).  Both are pure accessibility rewrites and
neither can change numerics.  This one pads, which is the stronger property of
the two: no byte offset in the file moves, so a fixed-form continuation column
cannot shift even in principle.  Do not "harmonise" the two without
regenerating every fixture built from whichever file changes.

Provenance of the input file (checked by this script before anything else):
