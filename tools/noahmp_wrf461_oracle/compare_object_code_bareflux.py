"""Diagnostic: what the visibility patch does and does not change in the object.

Read this together with two other artefacts, because on its own it does NOT
establish what one might hope:

* ``visibility_patch_leaves.py --check`` proves the *text* diff is nothing
  but ``private :: X`` -> ``public  :: X`` -- 50 lines, 300 bytes, no line
  length change.
* ``build_bareflux.sh <tree> <work> noopt pristine`` is the proof that
  actually matters.  gfortran gives a ``private`` module procedure LOCAL
  linkage, so the patch is needed only to make the symbol linkable at all;
  ``objcopy --globalize-symbol`` flips that one symbol-table binding while
  leaving ``.text`` byte-identical (the script checks that), and the resulting
  driver executes the unmodified module's own machine code.  Its fixture rows
  are bit-identical to the patched build's.  That is a behavioural proof, and
  it is what the acceptance claim rests on.

This script exists to document why object diffing is the *wrong* test here,
with the numbers.  Accessibility is exactly the thing GCC uses to decide what
it may assume about a procedure with no external callers, so:

  -O0 : all 85 procedures present in both, .rodata identical, but 24 bodies
        differ in register allocation and frame size.
  -O2 : the pristine build clones and specialises private procedures
        (``.isra``, ``.constprop``) and drops 40 of them entirely; 42 common
        bodies differ and .rodata differs.

None of that is the patch changing the program -- it is the patch changing
what the optimiser is allowed to know.  Expecting byte-identical object code
from a visibility change is simply the wrong expectation.

The two negative controls show the comparison can detect a real change:

``--control text``
    Perturbs one digit of ESAT's A0 coefficient; caught in .rodata.
``--control code``
    Reverses the SHB subtraction in BARE_FLUX; caught in the bodies.

Usage:
    compare_object_code_bareflux.py <wrf-tree> <workdir>
        [--control text|code] [--optlevel noopt|wrf]

# The comparison is run at -O0 by default, and that choice is essential.
# At -O2 GCC's interprocedural passes are *allowed* to see that a `private`
# procedure has no external callers: it clones it (.isra, .constprop), inlines
# it, or drops it entirely.  Making the symbol public removes that freedom, so
# the two objects legitimately differ -- 42 differing bodies and different
# .rodata, which `--optlevel wrf` will show you.  That is an artefact of
# accessibility changing what the optimiser may assume, not of the patch
# changing the program.  At -O0 no such pass runs and the comparison becomes
# a real test of whether the patch altered any emitted instruction.
#
# The remaining gap -- that WRF itself builds at -O2 -- is closed empirically
# rather than by argument: build_bareflux.sh builds the oracle at both -O0 and
# WRF's own -O2 and the two produce bit-identical fixture rows.  So the numbers
# in the fixture do not depend on the optimiser at all.
