"""Build the prebuilt-bridge release assets and the pins the wheel carries.

Two steps, run in this order by the release workflow (and reproducible
by hand from a checkout):

``pack``
    On each target platform, after ``cargo build --release --locked`` in
    the decoder, renderer and mapped-engine workspaces and the vendored
    dealiasing crate, collect every artifact of
    ``woof.bridge_assets.BUNDLED_ARTIFACTS``, plus the renderer's map
    assets, into one zip named for the release and the platform.  The
    archive is deterministic: binaries first in the declared artifact
    order, then the asset tree in sorted path order, fixed timestamps,
    no directory entries, so two packs of the same bytes produce the
    same archive.

    The asset file list is *walked from the tree*, never enumerated
    here.  An enumeration is what let the packaged basemaps fall out of
    the distribution in the first place: a list nobody regenerates goes
    quietly stale, and the plot that results has a storm on it and no
    coastline.  ``REQUIRED_ASSET_SUBDIRS`` declares the directories, the
    walk finds the files, and ``pin`` hashes whatever the walk found.

``pin``
    On one machine, from the bundles ``pack`` produced, compute the
    size + SHA-256 pins of every bundle and of every artifact inside it,
    and write them into the packaged pins document
    (``woof/data/bridges/bridge-pins.json``) *before* the wheel is
    built.  Optionally also write the release-asset manifest, the
    human-readable index of what a release published.

There is a third step the release workflow runs between them, only ever
relevant to a RE-RUN:

``adopt``
    Rust builds are not byte-reproducible, so a re-dispatched release
    run packs different zips than the ones a previous run already
    uploaded to the draft -- and every byte-identity gate downstream
    would strand the release on that difference.  ``adopt`` accepts the
    uploaded assets by content contract instead: the member list must be
    exactly what this commit packs (the binaries by filename, the map
    assets by path), every map-asset member must hash-match the source
    tree, and the uploaded manifest, when present, must pin the uploaded
    zips member by member and byte-match the manifest ``pin`` would
    regenerate from them.  What passes replaces the freshly built zips,
    so the pins, the wheel, and the byte-identity gates all describe the
    bytes the draft actually holds.  A member that diverges is named
    individually and the whole adoption is refused.  A draft with no
    uploaded assets adopts nothing: the first run is untouched.

Nothing here invents a hash: every number written comes from hashing
bytes that exist on this disk at the moment it runs.  ``pin`` refuses a
bundle whose contents do not match the artifact set woof expects for
that platform, so a half-built bundle cannot be pinned into a wheel.

``pin`` also refuses a STALE bundle.  Hashing binds a wheel to exact
bytes, but says nothing about which source produced them: the 1.4.1
cut nearly shipped prepared bundles predating the source tip, the two
platform zips not even from the same revision, and every check passed
because every check hashed what it was handed.  Each bundled artifact
now embeds ``GPUWM_BRIDGE_SOURCE_REV=<40-hex commit>`` at build time
(the workspace build scripts inject the checkout's HEAD), and ``pin
--source-rev COMMIT`` -- a required argument, so no cut can skip it --
extracts the stamp from every binary member and refuses a bundle whose
stamp is absent, unparseable, ambiguous, or names any other commit.
String extraction, never execution: it works on the other platform's
binaries and on a GPU-less runner.

The one exception is a VENDORED artifact, whose source is a verbatim
upstream tree frozen at a recorded commit and therefore does not move
with this checkout at all.  A HEAD stamp would say nothing about it and
injecting one would edit a tree whose whole claim is that it is
unmodified, so ``pin`` asks it for its declared contract marker instead
-- equally a property of the bytes, equally read without executing
anything, and equally fatal when a build predating this release's ABI
turns up in a bundle.
