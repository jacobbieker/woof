"""Measure the health-descriptor inventory of a configured experiment.

``woof.core.health.collect_state_fields`` auto-walks ``driver.fields``, so
every admitted physics scheme silently adds descriptors, and the inventory is
capped by ``MAX_HEALTH_FIELDS``.  That cap is enforced *inside*
``collect_state_fields``, which the forecast calls on the first synchronized
boundary -- i.e. after the run has allocated, ingested and started.  A
configuration that exceeds it is a configuration a user can select and then
lose a forecast to.  Nothing measured the count, so this does.

WHAT IS MEASURED, AND WHY THIS IS NOT AN ESTIMATE
-------------------------------------------------
The census runs the production constructors -- ``DomainState`` and
``initialize_physics`` -- at the experiment's real dimensions, materializes
every persistent scratch slot the authoritative preflight manifests declare
for that configuration, installs a child's rolling nest boundary through the
same ``attach_nest_boundaries`` its first FORCE calls, and then calls the
production ``collect_state_fields``.  The number reported is what that
function returns.

Calibration, so this is checkable rather than merely asserted: the one
descriptor count previously recorded anywhere in this repository is
``health.py``'s own "a four-domain NSSL-2 step currently reaches 527
descriptors", and this census reproduces 527 exactly, on the four-domain
reference case, at ``mp18-lsm2-pbl0-sfclay1-cu0``.

The cap is applied PER ``DomainState``: ``woof/core/model.py`` builds one
``StateHealthValidator`` per domain, each with its own descriptor tables, and
``collect_state_fields`` walks exactly one state (production passes no
``extra_tables``).  Counts therefore do NOT sum across a nest; a four-domain
experiment's exposure is its single largest domain.  Nor are they a per-domain
delta times the domain count: the ROOT and a CHILD are structurally different
inventories -- measured 229 vs 601 on the worst selectable combination -- so
multiplying either one by four measures nothing that exists.  The census
reports the per-domain counts and their peak.

NO DEVICE IS OPENED
-------------------
A NumPy-backed module is installed as ``cupy`` in ``sys.modules`` before any
woof import, so ``import cupy as cp`` in the production modules binds NumPy.
Every constructor then runs unchanged on host arrays.  Installation refuses to
proceed if the real CuPy has already been imported, so the census can never
fall back to the device, and every measurement additionally asserts that the
arrays it just built are ``numpy.ndarray``.

Host cost: about 0.23 GiB resident and ~0.05 s per domain at full dimensions
-- but ONLY because every measurement collects its own garbage.  The states
are not free-on-scope-exit (``state.physics``/``driver.state`` is a reference
cycle) and they are not demand-zero either (the constructors write into them),
so without an explicit ``gc.collect()`` the sweep grows by ~0.7 GiB per
four-domain selection and dies of ``MemoryError`` partway through the matrix.

The two land-surface host cold starts (``NOAHMP_INIT``/``SNOW_INIT`` and
``ruclsminit``) are replaced by no-ops for the census.  Both are per-column
Python loops over the whole slab -- minutes at 600x600 -- and neither adds or
removes a ``fields`` key: every write is into an array
``initialize_physics`` has already allocated.  The descriptor inventory is
therefore identical with and without them.

WHAT THE CEILING COSTS
----------------------
``MAX_HEALTH_FIELDS`` sizes seven fixed ``integration_health_*`` device slots
per ``DomainState`` -- 48 KiB per domain at 1024, reported as
``ceiling_metadata_bytes_per_domain``.  That is the entire resource cost:
raising the ceiling to 2048 would add 48 KiB per domain, 192 KiB across a
four-domain nest.  The ceiling is a tripwire against unnoticed inventory
growth, not a VRAM constraint, and anyone who needs to raise it should say so
rather than reach for the descriptor count.

    WHY THIS EXISTS
    ---------------
    ``selectable_matrix`` is the whole cross-product -- 2,560 combinations
    on the four-domain reference case -- and the 2026-08-13 test-estate
    audit measured what that costs: **461 s**, against this file's own
    docstring pricing it at "about 65 s".  It was the single most expensive
    file in the battery and it ran on every merge.

    WHAT WAS TRIED FIRST, AND WHY IT IS NOT WHAT THIS DOES
    -----------------------------------------------------
    The obvious reduction is one-axis-at-a-time: if a descriptor count were
    a SUM of independent per-scheme contributions, the peak of the product
    would be the product of the per-axis maxima, and 23 measurements would
    replace 2,560.  That was implemented, measured, and **it is wrong on
    this inventory**: the OAT sample predicts 527 on
    ``mp18-lsm0-pbl0-sfclay0-cu0-km1`` and the real exhaustive peak is 632
    on ``mp18-lsm3-pbl5-sfclay5-cu1-km1``.  The axes are not additive --
    LSM, PBL and surface layer interact through the WRF pairing table.
    Shipping the OAT version would have replaced a slow gate with a fast
    gate that was quietly 105 descriptors optimistic.

    WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD
    ----------------------
    The three coupled axes are swept against each other in full, at the
    ``anchor``'s values for the three that are not coupled; and those three
    are then swept one at a time at the anchor's coupled values.  That is
    ``4 x 5 x 4 + 8 + 2 + 2`` rather than ``8 x 4 x 5 x 4 x 2 x 2``: about
    92 combinations instead of 2,560, and it rediscovers the 632 peak
    rather than assuming it.

    THE ACCURATE LIMIT, WHICH THE SLOW ARM COVERS
    -------------------------------------------
    This finds a peak that moves WITHIN the recorded peak's family.  It
    cannot find a brand-new peak in some far corner of the product -- a
    scheme that only becomes expensive beside a cumulus option this does
    not vary, say.  That is what the exhaustive sweep is for, and it still
    runs: behind the ``slow`` marker, at the cut, not on every merge.
