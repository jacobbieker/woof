"""Freeze the surface-observation network table woof resolves domains against.

The archive publishes every network it holds, each with the bounding polygon
of the stations actually in it. That listing is the authority; this tool
copies it into the repository so a domain can be resolved to a network set
without a network round trip, and so the set a case used is a reviewable
artifact rather than whatever the archive answered that afternoon.

Only the ASOS/METAR families are kept. They are the ones
``gpuwm-obs.asos-surface.v2`` is defined over: hourly synoptic-style surface
reports with temperature, dewpoint, wind and pressure. The archive's other
families (COOP, DCP, RWIS, COCORAHS) report different variables on different
cadences and would need their own decode contract before they could be
resolved to.

Run it when the table needs refreshing::

    python tools/freeze_surface_networks.py --out woof/obs/data/surface_networks.json

The output carries the source URL, the instant it was taken and the digest of
the bytes it was taken from, so a later reader can tell whether the table
still matches the archive without diffing 266 rows by eye.
