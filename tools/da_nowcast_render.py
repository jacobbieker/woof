"""Map-styled gallery for a ``tools/da_nowcast.py`` case directory.

DEPRECATED FALLBACK for its weather fields, under the render law
(project render law, 2026-08-06).  Every WEATHER FIELD this module draws is
now drawable by the production Rust renderer, MEASURED 2026-08-17 on this
lane's own real inputs:

* a leg's column-max reflectivity composite -- ``tools/da_cycle_prepared``
  writes a real wrfout beside every ``.npz`` it saves (default-on), and
  ``woof render --engine rust`` draws it.  Proven on an archived case
  that predates that default by rebuilding the georeference from the
  case's own ``authority/experiment.toml``: 11 leg composites of
  ``nowcast_kdvn_202608072200``, 33 production panels;
* an observation file's own panels -- ``rw_obsgrid`` reads
  ``gpuwm-obs.radar-grid.v1`` natively (column-max Z, coverage depth,
  distinct-radar overlap, lowest-tilt radial velocity), proven on a real
  three-radar file built by the production spine from archive Level-II
  volumes.

WHAT KEEPS THIS MODULE ALIVE, so it is not a silent second tier: every
figure below is a MULTI-PANEL COMPOSITION (a lead ROW, a per-cycle
STRIP, verification PAIRS) or an analysis chart, and the renderer's
``MapRenderRequest`` composes exactly one panel.  Until there is a
composition primitive -- ``woof/pair_compose.py`` pastes finished PNGs
with Pillow and is the shape one would take -- the panels inside these
sheets are drawn here because the SHEET is drawn here.  Nothing in this
file should acquire a new single-panel product; that belongs to the
binaries above.

The analysis charts (:meth:`fig_numbers`, :meth:`fig_scorecard`) are NOT
demoted: the render law permits matplotlib for charts that are not
weather fields, and those two are innovation/spread lines and a
verification table.

Draws every field panel on the WOOF product-map frame, REUSING the
repo's rendering machinery rather than reinventing it:

* basemap geometry: the vendored assets the rust renderer draws from
  (``tools/rustwx/assets/basemap`` -- Natural Earth 10m + US Census
  counties; located via :func:`woof.rustwx.basemap_dir`);
* layer palette and stacking: ``rustwx-render``'s Filled-style
  constants (land #EEEDE6, water #E0EAF2; counties -> lakes -> states
  -> national -> coast, linework drawn ON TOP of the data fill);
* title block: the rusty-weather convention
  ``Init MM/DD HHZ | +HHH:MM | Valid MM/DD HH:MMZ | WOOF | Δx N km``
  with the source label in the footer.

Layout read from the case directory (the front door's own):

    authority/experiment.toml   init time, case name
    cycle/cycle-report.json     members, legs, per-cycle numbers
    cycle/composites/           per-leg per-member column-max npz
    obs/*.nc                    one radar-grid file per applied cycle
    obsverify/*.nc              optional after-the-fact verification obs
    gallery/                    output (index.html + PNGs, replaced
                                in place on re-render)

ACCURACY: demo-grade nowcast output, UNSCORED; free-forecast panels are
stamped "PAST LAST OBS" until an observed counterpart exists, and the
verification numbers (>=35 dBZ column counts in the echo mask, and
FSS(30 dBZ, 27 km) via :func:`woof.verify.field_metrics.fss_distance`)
are labeled demo-grade on the figure.

No radar-site names in this file, its defaults, or its identifiers; the
site id is read from the observation files' own metadata.
