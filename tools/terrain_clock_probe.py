"""The probe behind ``woof/terrain_clock_map.json``, the terrain clock's map.

It measures what the map's ``what`` text says: a bell ridge across the grid
in a uniform cross-ridge wind, integrated through the production ``step()``
with the generated dynamics (the 49-level ladder the domain wizard emits,
the etac the vertical survey derives for the crest, ``epssm`` 0.5,
``smdiv`` 0.1, ``emdiv`` 0.01, ``w_damping`` 1, the slope-tapered
sixth-order filter at 0.12 and the Rayleigh lid from 5 km below the 20 km
top).  A step HELD when the run finished and the peak vertical velocity
stayed under ``4 x wind x slope + 20`` m/s, the slope being the grid-read
steepest slope the rule itself reads.  The domain is periodic, eight rows
deep and ``(wind x seconds + 10 ridge half-widths) / spacing`` columns wide
(never fewer than 96), so the flow cannot come back round to the ridge in
the time it is integrated.

Subcommands:

* ``geometry``: the grid-read slope, etac and thinnest-layer fraction of
  each row, on the CPU.  These are the row keys the map records, so this
  is how a rebuilt probe proves it builds the map's own ridges.
* ``cell``: one ridge, one wind, one step, for a stated time; prints held
  and the peak vertical velocity.  How a single map entry is re-checked.
* ``extend``: longer steps on rows whose entry is the map's longest
  measured step.  Each wind is tried from the step the weaker wind held,
  down the rung list, over the map's half hour; a wind whose entry is
  already below the map's longest step keeps it, and so does every
  stronger wind.  Every step held that way is then run three hours, and
  where one stops the entry walks down the rungs (three hours each) to
  the longest that held, or back to the map's own entry.  Writes the
  measured rows as JSON.
* ``merge``: writes an ``extend`` result into the map: the row's entries
  at the measured winds, and ``top_s_per_km``, the longest step tried at
  each wind, which is what the rule treats as "held everything tried".
* ``fixed``: every listed step at every listed substep count on the listed
  ridges and winds, each for the stated seconds (three hours unless told),
  one JSON line per run.  Every pair is run, so a stop is seen at every
  step it happens at, not only above the first that held.
* ``adaptive``: the same ridge on the production adaptive clock instead of
  a fixed step: :class:`woof.core.adaptive_timestep.AdaptiveTimestepController`
  fed the dycore's own WRF CFL reduction after every step, from a stated
  first step up to each listed ``max_time_step``, WRF's ``3 x dx`` floor
  under it, landing on each hour as ``step_to_output_time`` does, and the
  substep count :func:`woof.core.adaptive_clock.adaptive_sound_steps`
  derives from the live step.  Held means the same as for a fixed step.
  One JSON line per run, with the steps the clock took.
* ``adaptive-extend``: a map row's adaptive entries: per wind, the
  longest ``max_time_step`` from a ladder (s/km, longest first) that held
  three hours at every CFL target pair of :data:`ADAPTIVE_TARGETS`, each
  wind tried from the step the weaker wind held.  ``merge`` writes them on
  the row's four-substep line with the map's ``adaptive`` block.

Needs CuPy for ``cell``, ``extend``, ``fixed``, ``adaptive`` and
``adaptive-extend``; ``geometry`` and ``merge`` do not.
