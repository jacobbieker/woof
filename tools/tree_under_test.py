"""Which checkout is pytest actually importing?

THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES
----------------------
``woof`` is installed editable on the development box, and a setuptools
editable install binds the distribution name to ONE directory -- the main
checkout -- through a finder on ``sys.meta_path``.  A meta-path finder
answers before ``sys.path`` does.  So a lane running its own test suite
inside ``git worktree`` gets this:

    cd <some-lane-worktree>
    python -m pytest tests/test_thing.py        # 34 passed

...where ``import woof`` and ``import tools.x`` resolved to
the MAIN CHECKOUT'S editable install.  The lane's edits were never executed.  The
suite measured the MAIN CHECKOUT and reported green about the lane, and
it does it just as cheerfully when the lane's change is broken.

This was found while verifying a harness lane's own work: a committed fix
to ``tools/check_negation_invariant.py`` had five tests failing in the
worktree that held the fix, because the worktree was running the
unfixed main-checkout copy of the file it had just fixed.  Every lane
worktree on this box has had the same hole under it.

There is no clever fix inside pytest for this; the remedy is one
environment variable, and the job of this module is to make sure nobody
ever again has to discover its absence from a mysterious result.  A
``sys.path`` entry beats the editable finder because setuptools APPENDS
its finder to ``sys.meta_path``, behind ``PathFinder``.

WHAT COUNTS AS WRONG
--------------------
Not "imported from outside the repository" -- that would condemn the one
shape that is legitimate and deliberate.  A wheel install is a real
subject of test: the user-door sweep installs a candidate wheel and runs
against it on purpose, and there ``woof`` lives in ``site-packages``
with no source checkout anywhere near it.

The failure is narrower and unambiguous: the imported module belongs to
ANOTHER SOURCE CHECKOUT OF THIS SAME PROJECT.  A directory that holds a
``pyproject.toml`` declaring this distribution is a checkout; if it is not
the one the tests were collected from, two trees are in the room and the
results describe the wrong one.
