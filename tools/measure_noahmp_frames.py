"""Read the Noah-MP runtime units' per-thread local frames on THIS card.

  python tools/measure_noahmp_frames.py measure --output receipt.json \\
      [--box "a development machine"] [--platform-family linux]
  python tools/measure_noahmp_frames.py verify
  python tools/measure_noahmp_frames.py resolve [--extra gpu-cu13]

``measure`` compiles all fifteen Noah-MP runtime translation units through
the production factory (``woof.core.noahmp_kernel_sources.compile_runtime_unit``)
in a FRESH process with an empty CuPy cache, reads every exported kernel's
function attributes (no launch), writes the reading as JSON and prints the
``ComposedUnitFrameRecording`` row it becomes -- paste that row into
``woof/core/kernel_frame_recordings.py`` (``NOAHMP_COMPOSED_FRAME_RECORDINGS``)
to make this card's compile platform a measured one instead of one priced
from the ceiling over the recorded platforms.

``verify`` takes the same reading and compares it with the row the tree
already holds for this platform: exit 0 when every frame and every unit
identity agree, 1 with the differences otherwise, 2 when this platform has no
row.  It is the driver gate for the composed units, the counterpart of
``tools/vram_reserve_probe.py frames`` for the standalone ones.

``resolve`` is the packaging half of the same gate.  The NVRTC build a
fresh install compiles on is set by the cuda-toolkit release the package's
``[ctk]`` extra resolves to on the day pip runs, so it asks pip (``pip
install --dry-run --report``, a clean resolution against the live index,
nothing installed) what ``recast-woof[gpu-cu13]`` / ``recast-woof[gpu-cu12]`` resolve
to right now and compares the ``nvidia-cuda-nvrtc`` version with the
declaration in ``RESOLVED_TOOLCHAIN_PINS``: exit 0 when the declared build
is what the index resolves, 1 when it moved -- which is the day the table
needs a new row on every architecture the pin lists, or every fresh install
drops from a measured Noah-MP price to the ceiling.  It needs
the network and is run before a cut; the CPU gate in
``tests/test_kernel_frame_recordings.py`` holds the declaration and the rows
in step with each other and with pyproject without it.

What a reading is and is not: a frame is a compile attribute of one
(target architecture, NVRTC build) pair and prices that pair exactly; a
card on any other pair is priced from the element-wise ceiling over the
recorded rows, and plan review says so beside the number.  A reading here is
not a forecast, not numerical parity, and not a statement about any other
card.
