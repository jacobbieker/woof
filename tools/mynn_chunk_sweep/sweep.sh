# Sweep the MYNN column chunk on one card and prove the forecast does not move.
#
#   sweep.sh [--dry] [--chunks "4096 8192 16384"]
#
# The widths come from --chunks, or from CHUNKS in the environment, or from
# the default list.  The default list BRACKETS the shipped width, narrower
# and wider, and it is that way because of what the first sweep could not
# find: it started at the width then shipped and only ever widened, so the
# only thing it could return was a direction, and it ranked its own narrowest
# arm first.  Running downward put the optimum two widths below it.  A ladder
# with the shipped width at one end answers "which way", never "where".
#
# For each width in CHUNKS it runs STEPS root steps of a prepared control leg
# with WOOF_MYNN_COLUMN_CHUNK set to that width, records the per-root-cycle
# wall time from the run's own step log, hashes every wrfout frame the run
# wrote, and then deletes the frames.  The widths are run PASSES times, the
# even passes in reverse order, so an arm that won only because it ran while
# the card was cool or alone is visible as a disagreement between passes.
#
# It waits for an idle card and an absent mutex itself, claims OWNER, writes
# DONE (or FAILED with the tail of the log) and releases OWNER, so it can be
# started detached under tmux and left alone.
#
# What the integrate stage reads when it is finished:
#   $W/sweep.tsv      one row per arm: width, quiet median seconds per root
#                     cycle, the radiation populations, wall, peak memory,
#                     the width the RECEIPT says the run used, and how many
#                     card samples saw a process outside this engine's own
#                     install (foreign_seen) and how many saw the arm's own
#                     forecast (own_seen)
#   $W/digests/       one sha256 list per arm, over every frame of that arm
#   the IDENTITY line EQUAL, or the first arm and frame that disagreed
#   $W/summary.txt    the table and the verdict, as text
#
# IDENTITY IS THE POINT.  Every MYNN column kernel gives one CUDA thread one
# whole column, reads no neighbour, and holds no shared memory, no atomic and
# no per-chunk seed, so the width is workspace shape only and the frames must
# be bit-identical across every arm.  A digest that moves is a defect to find,
# not a tolerance to widen: stop the sweep and report the arm.
set -u

# Resolved BEFORE the cd below: summarise.py lives beside this script, and
