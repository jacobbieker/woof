"""Refuse a release build whose tree is not "the tagged commit plus the pin step".

Two documents about the same bytes are true at once, by design:

* the COMMITTED ``woof/data/bridges/bridge-pins.json`` at a release tag says
  ``release: null, platforms: {}`` -- GitHub's automatic source archives are
  snapshots of the tagged tree and must not impersonate pinned release bytes
  (``tools/verify_source_bridge_pins.py``, a hard gate by owner ruling
  2026-08-03, and the ``cut`` job of ``.github/workflows/publish.yml``);
* the WORKING COPY of the same file, in the build workspace, is pinned by
  ``tools/build_bridge_bundle.py pin`` from the exact bundle bytes just
  built, and the wheel and sdist are built from that working copy
  (``setup.py`` refuses a wheel from an unpinned tree).

So the pin step is the ONE working-tree mutation a release build is allowed
to carry, and nothing checked that it was the only one.  The 2.7.0 candidate
showed what that costs: the engine wheels were built correctly from
c6391a83b plus pins, but the SDK kit beside them was generated from a tree
with 48 dirty files (XPORT-002), and a reviewer reading ``git status`` in
the build tree could not tell the two situations apart (PKGENG-003, RC2-003).

This gate names the three breakages and refuses each by name:

1. any tracked modification, addition or deletion other than the pins file,
   or any untracked file under a packaged root -- the artifacts would carry
   bytes the tagged commit does not, so the release cannot be reproduced
   from its tag;
2. a release version whose working pins are still ``release: null`` -- the
   2.5.0 blocker verbatim (``pip install recast-woof && woof setup`` reports
   FAILED bridges on a clean home), caught here BEFORE the wheel build
   rather than by setup.py after the multi-hour bundle builds;
3. a COMMITTED pins document that is pinned -- it would fail
   ``verify_source_bridge_pins.py`` at the tag and make GitHub's source
   archive claim bytes it does not carry.

Run it in the build workspace immediately before ``python -m build`` (the
CI ``prepare`` job after its pin step, and the offline desktop build alike):

    python tools/verify_release_build_tree.py

A pre-release or development version (``2.7.0rc1``, ``2.7.0.dev3``, a local
``+`` suffix) is allowed unpinned working pins, because a dev wheel built
under ``WOOF_ALLOW_UNPINNED_WHEEL=1`` is exactly what those trees make;
the cleanliness and committed-pins checks still apply.
