"""Run the surface-moisture ledger over a column A/B and account for the gap.

WHAT THIS ANSWERS.  When two arms of a run disagree about 2 m moisture, this
says WHICH TERM the disagreement lives in, with a number against each, and
refuses to let the difference vanish into a rounding story.

THE ACCOUNTING.  Q2 is a function of the provider's inputs and nothing else.
For the SFCLAY-family identity ``q2 = qsfc + (qv1 - qsfc)*r`` with
``r = chs/cqs2``, the exact first-order decomposition of a change is

    dQ2  =  (1-r)*dQSFC  +  r*dQV1  +  (QV1-QSFC)*dR  +  (cross terms)

and every term on the right is computed from ledger columns that were
recorded, not inferred.  The cross term is carried explicitly rather than
dropped, so the four named terms plus the cross term reproduce the measured
dQ2 to the FP32 budget.  What is left over after all five is the
UNEXPLAINED REMAINDER, and a remainder above the reporting threshold is
itself a finding: it means the published Q2 did not come from the inputs the
ledger recorded, which is a different and worse defect than any of the terms.

THE ARMS.  ``--arm-a`` and ``--arm-b`` each name a ledger JSON written by a
run.  Arms must share their column set and their times, because an
accounting between different columns is not an accounting.

    Returns the four physical terms, the cross term, and the remainder.
    Every value is in kg/kg so they add up without a unit conversion in the
    middle, where sign errors hide.

    THE PROVIDER DECIDES THE TERMS.  The SFCLAY-family identity is
    ``q2 = qsfc + (qv1 - qsfc)*r`` with ``r = chs/cqs2``; Noah's SFCDIAGS
    identity is ``q2 = qsfc - qfx*s`` with ``s = 1/(rho*cqs2)`` and
    ``rho = psfc/(RD*tsk)``.  These are different functions of different
    recorded inputs, so a decomposition written for one is not exact for
    the other: run the SFCLAY terms over Noah rows and the whole QFX route
    lands in the "unexplained" remainder, which is exactly what happened
    the first time this tool met a land A/B.  Each branch below is the
    algebraically exact expansion of its own identity, cross term carried,
    so the remainder measures only FP32 publication rounding (and the
    out-of-range guard branch, which substitutes ``qv1`` and is a
    different function again -- a remainder on a guard-branch column is
    reported, not hidden).
