"""How much ground the pole-clearance refusal actually covers.

The refusal that stops a root domain whose footprint encloses the
projection pole is stated in two places -- the companion doors
(``woof.domain_wizard``) and plan review
(``woof.experiment.build_experiment``) -- and both ask one function,
``woof.static.projection.footprint_contains_pole``.  This probe sweeps
that function so the refusal's reach is a measured number rather than an
assumption: three projections x six centre latitudes x three
resolutions, on the antimeridian, at one root size.

The rows matter because the limit is NOT a "centred on the pole" special
case and NOT a latitude band: an ordinary wide Arctic domain reaches it
while a narrower one at the same centre does not.

Run it from a checkout:
