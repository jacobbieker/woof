"""Expose WRF's t_2ave workspace from an otherwise unchanged native solve.

This is a verification-only witness.  It adds global stores of already
computed native register words.  The oracle runner requires every normal
output word to match the uninstrumented launch before using this workspace.

The witness instruments the module as the default compile sees it: the
opt-in WRF-exact branches, some of which assign the same workspace words,
are resolved away first (woof/verify/default_kernel_source.py), so the
stores land only in the code production runs.
