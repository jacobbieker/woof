"""Run a staged DA sweep unattended, behind whatever already owns the card.

The sweep this drives turns three estimates into measurements: what a
WoFS-sized ensemble costs at our current grid spacing, what finer spacing
costs at a storm-scale footprint, and what the localization radius costs
when it is held at a fixed physical size while the grid refines.

Three properties matter more than speed here, and each is a deliberate
choice rather than a default:

**It never contends and it never kills.**  Before every arm it asks
``woof run``'s own admission whether that arm would be allowed to launch
(:mod:`woof.supervisor.preflight_exclusive_gpu`, via ``--gate``), and if
the answer is no it waits and asks again.  That admission PRICES the arm's
reservation against the memory the device reports free, so the gate is
given the arm's configuration to price: a plan (or an arm) that names
``gate_config`` is waited on with the very number ``woof run`` will price
it from, which makes the wait condition and the refusal condition the same
condition by construction and stops the queue clearing its own gate and
then being refused.  An arm that names no configuration is gated on the
stricter unpriced question the gate states in its own output: wait for a
card with no CUDA compute co-tenant at all.  A queue that gives up is a
*recorded verdict*, not a silent exit.

**It captures stderr.**  A sibling queue in this tree lost the entire
diagnosis of a failed run because it piped only stdout, leaving a
zero-byte log beside a nonzero exit code.  Every step here gets both
streams, to separate files, and the tail of stderr is copied into the
status log on failure so the status file alone is enough to say what
broke.

**It is resumable and it is per-arm fail-soft.**  Each arm writes a
``.done`` marker; a rerun skips what already finished.  An arm that fails
is recorded and the queue moves to the next one, because five arms where
three succeeded is a result and five arms where the night aborted on the
first is not.
