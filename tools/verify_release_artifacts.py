"""Prove the exact Python distributions and bridge assets before publishing.

Run this script with the newly built wheel installed into an isolated virtual
environment and Python ``-I`` from outside the checkout.  It intentionally
uses the installed package's production parsers, staging path, executable
probes, and CPU-library ABI check.  The checkout supplies only this verifier
and the expected artifacts.

``--dry-run`` runs the same assertions over locally staged or fixture-built
artifacts, outside a live cut.  It skips exactly the four that are properties
of a wheel installed outside the checkout and of executable target-native
binaries -- the installed module's location, its version, its packaged pins
bytes, and the host probes -- and runs every document, wheel, sdist, and
bundle assertion unchanged.  It exists because this verifier could previously
only ever run mid-cut: a defect in it (the bundle membership test that
compared against the binary pins alone, and so refused every bundle the
current packer produces) burned a live 1.4.1 round before anything could
catch it.  ``tests/test_verify_release_artifacts.py`` drives this mode
against bundles the real packer produced, so the next such defect fails in
CI instead.
