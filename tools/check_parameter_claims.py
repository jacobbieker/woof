"""Fail when a declared knob claims an implementation it cannot show.

The physics registry is the answer to "which of WRF's knobs does this model
have?".  That answer is only worth reading if a claim cannot be made by
assertion, so implementation is proven rather than asserted: a parameter
counts as implemented exactly when it cites ``consuming_read``, a
repo-relative file that actually reads it.

This gate re-resolves every citation against the tree:

* the cited file must exist and must parse, so an unreadable citation fails
  rather than passing unexamined;
* it must reference the knob in code -- prose does not count, and both of
  Python's prose channels are removed before the search: ``#`` comments and
  module/class/function docstrings;
* the knob must be a real GPUWM configuration field, so a citation cannot
  point at prose that merely mentions the name; and
* a parameter marked ``implemented: false`` must say why, and must not also
  carry a citation or a default that would leak into resolved settings.

Only those two channels are removed.  A string literal that is not a
docstring stays, because a read can legitimately go through one --
``getattr(cfg, "moist_cq", True)`` in ``woof/core/acoustic.py`` is such a
read -- and blanking every string would fail real code for containing a
string.

Two properties matter beyond correctness.  A claim cannot outlive the code
that justified it -- delete the consuming read and this fails.  And each
scheme's owner controls only their own rows: a declaration with no citation
asserts nothing and passes, so turning a knob on means citing the read that
makes it true, never editing someone else's entry.

``tests/test_parameter_claim_gate.py`` is the negative control: it builds a
scratch tree whose cited module is nothing but a docstring naming the knob
and asserts this gate rejects it.
