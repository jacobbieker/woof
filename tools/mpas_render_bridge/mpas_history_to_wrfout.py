"""Convert one MPAS history frame into a wrfout-shaped frame the renderer takes.

SUPERSEDED -- REFERENCE GENERATOR, NOT A PRODUCT PATH.
The Rust crate ``tools/rustwx/crates/rw-mpas`` (binary ``rw_mpas_convert``)
owns this on the release line and reproduces this file bit for bit: identical
weights digests on both render windows, 404,772,334 float values compared, 127
of 127 rendered PNGs byte-identical.  Receipt:
``evidence/rw-mpas-converter-parity.json``.  This file stays because that
receipt is *about* it -- delete the reference and the parity claim becomes
unreproducible -- but it is kept as the generator of that reference, never as
a route a run takes.  A bare invocation refuses; ``--regenerate-reference``
is the acknowledged door for regenerating the goldens.

The pinned Rust renderer (``rw_wrfbatch``) has no unstructured path.  Its real
named products -- the ones with operational colortables, titles and map
furniture -- come from the real-WRF import route, which needs a structured
grid, ``Times``, ``XLAT``/``XLONG``, and a rank-4 ``T``.  This tool takes an
MPAS history file on an unstructured mesh (163,842 cells for x4.163842),
gathers every field that has a WRF product equivalent onto one of the cached
render windows from ``mpas_resample_weights.py``, and writes a wrfout-shaped
NetCDF frame.

What it does not do: invent a field the MPAS history does not carry.  A WRF
variable with no MPAS source is simply absent, its products report
``missing-fields``, and the absence is recorded in the emitted file's
``MPAS_ABSENT_WRF_FIELDS`` attribute and in the run report.  A missing field
is a port history-stream gap to fix upstream, never something to synthesize
here.

Every emitted file carries the source history digest, the mesh digest, the
weights digest, the resample method, and this tool's own digest.
