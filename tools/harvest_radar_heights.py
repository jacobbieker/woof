"""Harvest every European radar's antenna height from the volumes themselves.

The second half of ``tools/freeze_radar_sites.py``. That tool freezes the
MeteoGate locations endpoint, which publishes a **2-D point**: latitude and
longitude and no height. The WMO OSCAR/Surface registry its ``detail`` link
names answers ``totalCount: 0``, so the height is neither in the feed nor one
hop from it, and every row of the frozen table said ``elevation_m: null``.

**It is in the data.** ODIM puts the antenna height above mean sea level at
``/where/height`` in every polar volume, and the archive publishes a volume
for every listed radar. So the gap was a consequence of freezing the table
from the metadata endpoint rather than from the product, and it closes by
reading the product.

Why it matters at all: beam height above ground is a function of antenna
height above mean sea level, so a site assimilated with the wrong antenna
height places every gate at the wrong altitude -- smoothly, with nothing that
looks like a failure. That is why the table refuses a null rather than
substituting a zero, and it is why this tool cross-checks (below) rather than
trusting a filename to have told it which radar it is reading.

Discovery
---------
``ListObjectsV2`` on the object store, not the OGC-EDR gateway. The gateway
serves the same objects and its CoverageJSON is the documented route, but a
136-site sweep trips its rate limiter into a sustained ``429`` that does not
clear; measured 2026-08-14, 80 of 136 sites unreachable that way over an hour.
The store's listing has no such limit and the bytes downloaded are identical
objects from the identical allowlisted prefix.

Bytes
-----
One file per site, the smallest the site publishes, deleted after reading.
``/where/height`` is a root attribute identical across every file of a volume,
so a 46 KB single-sweep scan answers the same question a 31 MB whole-volume
``PVOL`` does. Whole files, never a byte-range: this is a small read by
choosing a small file, not by subsetting a large one.

The cross-check, which is the point
-----------------------------------
Every file also carries ``/where/lat`` and ``/where/lon``, and this tool
compares them against the position the frozen table already holds for that
site. Matching the wrong file to the wrong site is the failure mode that
would silently poison the whole column -- every gate of a radar placed at
another radar's altitude -- and it is invisible in the output, because a
height is just a plausible number. The position agreement is what makes the
height trustworthy, so it is recorded per site and summarised, and
``freeze_radar_sites.py`` refuses to merge a document whose worst
disagreement exceeds :data:`POSITION_TOLERANCE_DEG`.

EXPERIMENTAL, like the rest of this lane. No site names belong in this file's
defaults or identifiers: the site list comes from the table.
