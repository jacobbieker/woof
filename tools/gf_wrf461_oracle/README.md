# Grell-Freitas cumulus oracle, WRF v4.6.1

The first WRF numbers this project has produced for `cu_physics = 3`.  Grell &
Freitas (2014) is a scale-aware mass-flux convection scheme: a 16-member
closure ensemble over a single updraft/downdraft cloud model, with an
Arakawa-Wu style `sig = (1-frh)^2` factor multiplying every closure mass flux
so the parameterised contribution tapers off as the grid approaches
cloud-resolving spacing.  Like Shin-Hong, the whole point of the scheme is
that its answer MOVES with dx, so dx is a fixture axis here, not a constant.

## The v4.6.1 file set is not the name you expect

WRF v4.6.1 ships the driver as `phys/module_cu_gf_wrfdrv.F`.  There is no
`module_cu_gf_driver.F` in this release; that name belongs to the CCPP/UFS
packaging of the same physics and does not exist in the WRF-ARW tree.  The
full set, with the digests `build.sh` enforces:

| file | lines | sha256 | in the port |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `phys/module_cu_gf_wrfdrv.F` | 844 | `0cead99c913b6a74f3a492aea1e1c7ef6d34f95402574336022d1a6c716a4382` | yes |

The byte pin is the FILE SET, not a git commit, because the campaign trees are
tarball extractions.  Every digest above was read out of the v4.6.1 release
tarball `v4.6.1.tar.gz`, sha256
`b8ec11b240a3cf1274b2bd609700191c6ec84628e4c991d3ab562ce9dc50b5f2` -- the same
tarball the Shin-Hong oracle pinned, verified here by re-extracting
`module_bl_shinhong.F` from it and confirming it still hashes to the
`99f44dbe...` that oracle recorded.  `build.sh` refuses to run against an
edited file.

## What it builds

```
bash tools/gf_wrf461_oracle/build.sh <WRF_SOURCE_ROOT> <BUILD_DIR>
```

Built and run 2026-08-04 on this workstation's WSL Ubuntu-24.04 (gfortran
13.3.0, glibc 2.39), the same toolchain family the Noah-MP oracles record as
`(WSL)`.  These land in `woof/data/gf/oracle/`:

| file | contents |
| --- | --- |
| `gf-levels.csv` | 12 cases x 6 dx x 2 shallow arms x 40 levels: every per-level input GFDRV saw and every per-level output it wrote (`RTHCUTEN`, `RQVCUTEN`, `RQCCUTEN`, `RQICUTEN`, `DUDT_PHY`, `DVDT_PHY`, `GDC`, `GDC2`) |
| `gf-surface.csv` | per (case, dx, arm): the scalar and 2-D inputs, plus `RAINCV`, `PRATEC`, `HTOP`, `HBOT`, `ktop_deep` and the four shallow diagnostics |
| `gf-isolation.csv` | per (case, dx, arm): the count of output words that differ bitwise between the packed 18-column slab and the same column run alone in a one-column tile |
| `gf-stage-levels.csv` | the same cases decomposed: GFDRV's prepared column (`zo`, `po`, `t2d`, `q2d`, `tn`, `qo`, `tshall`, `qshall`, `dhdt`, `us`, `vs`, `rhoi`, `omeg`) beside every per-level thing `cup_gf` and `CUP_gf_sh` returned |
| `gf-stage-surface.csv` | the internals GFDRV never exposes: `ierr`, `ierrc` (WRF's own free-text rejection reason), `kbcon`, `ktop`, `k22`, `jmin`, `edt`, `xmb_out`, `pret`, the ten-slot `forcing` diagnostic, `mconv` before and after, and the shallow equivalents |
| `gf-stage-consistency.csv` | per (case, dx, arm): how many words of the driver's output the decomposition fails to reproduce bitwise, plus `ktop`/`xmbs`/`ierr` from both paths |
| `gf-deep-levels.csv` | 81 per-level fields inside `cup_gf`, at every stage boundary: `cup_env`'s `qes`/`he`/`hes` on both states, `cup_env_clev`'s eight cloud-level fields on both, the updraft `zu` before and after `get_lateral_massflux`, `hc`/`hco`/`dby`/`dbyo`/`dbyt`, the whole downdraft, `cup_up_moisture`'s condensate, the six `della*` fields, the `mbdt`-perturbed state, and `outt` before and after the dissipative-heating step |
| `gf-deep-surface.csv` | 98 per-column fields: `zws`/`ztexec`/`zqexec`, `entr_rate`/`sig`, `kbmax`/`kdet`/`k22`/`hkb`/`hkbo`, `kbcon` at each of its three revisions, `kstabi`, `pmin_lev`, `ktop` at each of its three, `jmin`, `bud`, `pwavo`/`pwevo`/`psum`/`psumh`, `aa0`/`aa1`/`aa1_bl`/`xaa0`, `tau_ecmwf`/`tau_bl`, `edt`/`edto`, all 16 `xf_ens` slots, `xf_dicycle`, `closure_n`, the 10 `forcing` slots, and `ierr` at seven points in the routine |
| `gf-deep-consistency.csv` | per (case, dx, arm): differing words between the replication and the real `cup_gf`.  Zero is the only accepted value |
| `gf-shallow-levels.csv` | 65 per-level fields inside `CUP_gf_sh`, at every stage boundary, keyed by CASE alone -- see "the shallow capture has no dx axis" below |
| `gf-shallow-surface.csv` | 61 per-column fields: `buo_flux`/`zws`/`ztexec`/`zqexec`, `cap_max`, `kbmax`, `k22` before and after `cup_kbcon`, `hkb`/`hkbo` at each of their three revisions, `kstabi`, the five `k_inv_layers` slots, `ktop` at each of its four, the `SH2` shape parameters, `aa0`/`aa1`/`xaa0`, `xkshal`, all three `xff_shal` members, `xmb`, `pre`, and `ierr` at six points |
| `gf-shallow-consistency.csv` | per (case, dx): differing words against the real `CUP_gf_sh`, and differing words against the same case at dx = 1000 m.  Zero is the only accepted value for both |
| `gf-pow-probe.txt` | bit patterns of every power and gamma form in the scheme beside its algebraic decompositions, at -O0 on the oracle's own toolchain |

`libmvec-report.txt` and `oracle-sha256sums.txt` are the receipts.

Four programs write thirteen data files between them.

## Four entry points, and why

`run_cu_gf.F90` pins `GFDRV`.  That is the right fixture boundary, but it is a
black box for a failing port: `ierr`, `ierrc`, `xmb`, `kbcon`, `k22`, `jmin`,
`edt` and `forcing` are all driver locals.  A port whose `RTHCUTEN` is wrong
cannot tell whether it lost the parcel in `cup_kbcon`, in the closure, or in
`neg_check`.

`run_cup_gf.F90` therefore replicates GFDRV's own column preparation and calls
`CUP_gf_sh`, `neg_check`, `cup_gf`, `neg_check` directly, capturing every
intermediate.  It proves its own fidelity rather than asserting it: after the
direct calls it applies GFDRV's output algebra (:724-840) to what it captured
and compares that against a real `GFDRV` call on the same column, bitwise.
**208 of 216 rows are exact.**  The 8 that are not are explained under "Mixed
precision in the driver" below and are marked in `gf-stage-consistency.csv`;
on those rows the GFDRV fixture is authoritative and the stage fixture is not.

The `ierrc` column is useful, and it lies about a third of the time.  WRF
passes the *same* `ierrc` array into the two end-of-routine cap probes
(module_cu_gf_deep.F:1642-1654, `cup_kbcon` on `ierr2` and `ierr3`), so a
column that converged can still come back carrying "could not find reasonable
kbcon in cup_kbcon" written by a probe that has nothing to do with its own
`ierr`.  Measured over the fixture:

| `ierr` | `ierrc` | rows |
| ---: | --- | ---: |
| 0 | (blank) | 12 |
| 0 | could not find reasonable kbcon in cup_kbcon | **48** |
| 2 | could not find k22 | 12 |
| 3 | could not find reasonable kbcon in cup_kbcon | 76 |
| 6 | cloud depth very shallow | 36 |
| 17 | cloud work function zero | 20 |
| 51 | (blank) | 12 |

So **60 of 216 columns converge**, not the 24 an earlier reading of the blank
messages suggested, and `ierr == 51` -- the `denom < 1.e-8` mass-continuity
guard, which sets no message at all -- accounts for 12 more.  Read `ierr`;
treat `ierrc` as a hint.

### run_gf_stages.F90: inside cup_gf

`run_cup_gf` still leaves the 22-procedure call graph a black box, which is
the granularity a port is written at.  `run_gf_stages.F90` is a
statement-order replication of `CUP_gf`'s body (:359-1868) for the arm WRF
reaches -- `imid = 0`, `dicycle = 1`, `ichoice = 0`, `iversion = 1`,
`irainevap = 0`, `autoconv = 1`, `aeroevap = 1`, `nranflag = 0`, `csum = 0` --
calling the module's own public procedures and writing out every intermediate
between them: 81 per-level fields and 98 per-column fields, at every stage
boundary from `cup_env` to `cup_output_ens_3d`.

It proves itself the same way and to a stricter bar.  Unlike the GFDRV
decomposition, this replication shares every constant and every expression
with the module it replicates, so there is no mixed-precision residual to
allow for: after the replication it calls the real `cup_gf` on the same
prepared column and compares 9 level fields, 3 column reals, 5 column
integers and the 10 `forcing` slots bitwise.  **0 differing words on all 216
rows**, and `build.sh` fails on any nonzero count.

One measurement falls straight out of it: **the deep answer does not depend on
the shallow arm.**  All 101 columns of `gf-deep-surface.csv` are identical
between `ishallow = 0` and `ishallow = 1` on every one of the 108 (case, dx)
pairs.  `xmbs_in` reaches only `cup_output_ens_3d`, and only the `dicycle == 2`
branch there reads it; `module_cu_gf_wrfdrv.F:72` fixes `dicycle = 1`.  The
216-column deep fixture is 108 distinct deep answers run twice.

### run_gf_shallow.F90: inside CUP_gf_sh

The same treatment for the arm beside the deep one.  `run_gf_shallow.F90`
replicates `CUP_gf_sh`'s body (module_cu_gf_sh.F:241-874) statement by
statement for the arm WRF reaches -- `ichoice_s = 0`, `MAKE_CALC_FOR_XK =
.true.`, `WRF_CHEM = 0` -- calling the module's own public procedures and
transcribing `rates_up_pdf`/`get_zu_zd_pdf_fim` so the `SH2` shape parameters
are captured.  It then runs the real `CUP_gf_sh` on the same prepared column
and compares 6 level fields and 6 column values bitwise: **0 differing words
on all 108 (case, dx) rows**, and `build.sh` fails on any nonzero count.

`CUP_gf_sh` is not a reduced `cup_gf` and a port that treats it as one will be
wrong in eight places.  No downdraft.  No closure ensemble -- three closures,
averaged.  `mbdt = .5` against the deep `.1`.  `entr_rate = 9.e-5` flat.
`ktop` from `get_inversion_layers`' 800 hPa slot or from 200 mb above `kbcon`,
never from a buoyancy integral.  `cup_kbcon` at `iloop = 5`, which is a
genuinely different path through that routine.  The `SH2` branch of
`get_zu_zd_pdf_fim`, `beta = 2.5` against `UP`'s 1.3 and a 0.8 tunning clamp
against 0.9.  And no scale awareness at all.

Two traps the fixture found and a reading did not.

**`k22` is off by one, as shipped.**  `k22(i) = maxloc(HEO_CUP(i,
2:kbmax(i)), 1)` (:373) is a MAXLOC over an array SECTION, so it returns the
position *within* `2:kbmax`, and WRF uses that position as an absolute level
index without adding the section's offset.  WRF's `k22` is one level below the
argmax of `heo_cup`.  Case 13 of the fixture is the witness: the argmax is at
level 9 and `k22` comes out 8.  A port that "corrects" this disagrees with WRF
on every column where the two differ.

**`po_cup` and `gamma_cup` come back zeroed on rejected columns.**  The
perturbed-state `cup_env_clev` (:760) is handed `po_cup` and `gamma_cup`
themselves, not fresh arrays, and the routine zeroes its outputs *before* its
`ierr` guard.  Nothing downstream reads either on a rejected column, so this
is invisible in WRF and essential in a capture.  The same call also
overwrites `xhe`: `cup_env`'s third argument is its `he` output, and the guard
is `itest .le. 0`, so the perturbed moist static energy built from `dellah` at
:731 is thrown away before `xhc` reads it -- 3 to 5 lanes per column, 1-2 ULP,
the identical trap `CUP_gf:1508` has.

### The shallow capture has no dx axis, and that is a measurement

`CUP_gf_sh` takes no `dx` argument (module_cu_gf_sh.F:58-75) and none of the
fourteen fields GFDRV hands it depends on grid spacing, so the six-point dx
sweep produces six identical shallow answers.  `gf-shallow-levels.csv` and
`gf-shallow-surface.csv` are therefore keyed by case alone -- 18 columns, not
216.  The claim is not assumed: `gf-shallow-consistency.csv` runs all 108
(case, dx) pairs and records, per row, the differing-word count between the
module's own answer there and its answer at dx = 1000 m.  `build.sh` fails if
any row is nonzero, so a future WRF that makes the shallow arm scale-aware
breaks the build rather than silently invalidating the capture.

What the 18 columns exercise: **5 converge**, 2 stop at `ierr = 3` (cup_kbcon
found no reasonable `kbcon` at `iloop = 5`), 9 at `ierr = 5` (`ktop` below
`kbcon+1`), 2 at `ierr = 21` (`xmb <= 0`).  16 of the 18 reach the `SH2`
profile, so the beta-function branch has far better coverage than the
converged count suggests, and its `tunning` hits **both** clamps -- 0.2 on two
columns and 0.8 on one.  Not reached: `ierr` 2, 17, 41 and 231, and the
`ktop > ki+1` re-topping at :533.  Those are transcribed and unexercised, and
the parity gate says so in a test rather than leaving it to be discovered.

### tgammaf is worse in the shallow arm than in the deep one

`SH2`'s `beta = 2.5` is not an integer, so all three `tgammaf` calls in
`fzu = gamma(alpha+beta)/(gamma(alpha)*gamma(beta))` are genuine gamma
evaluations.  Measured over the 16 columns that reach the profile: 4 exact and
a worst case of **4 ULP**, against the deep arm's 2.

And it costs more than a rounding footnote here too, though less than in the
deep arm.  `xkshal = (xaa0 - aa1)/mbdt` is the same difference-of-two-cloud-
work-functions cancellation `xk` is, so 2-4 ULP in `fzu` -- order 3e-7
relative -- comes out of the shallow closure at up to **8.4e-3 relative in
`xmb`**, and `pre` follows it.  Four orders of magnitude of amplification,
against the deep arm's five to six; the shallow arm is milder only because
`mbdt = .5` against the deep `.1` widens the denominator.

## Mixed precision in the driver

`module_gfs_machine.F` sets `kind_phys = selected_real_kind(13,60)`, i.e.
real(8), and `module_gfs_physcons.F` declares every constant
`real(kind=kind_phys)` -- but initialises them from **default-real literals**
(`con_g = 9.80665e+0`, not `9.80665d+0`).  So GFDRV's `g`, `cp`, `xlv` and
`r_v` are double-precision parameters, and the three expressions they appear
in --

```
omeg(I,K) = -g*rho(i,k,j)*w(i,k,j)                        (:471)
mconv(i)  = mconv(i) + omeg(i,k)*dq/g                     (:487)
DHDT(I,K) = cp*RTHBLTEN*pi + XLV*RQVBLTEN                 (:416)
```

-- evaluate in double and round once on the store into a real(4) local.  That
is not the same as either a pure-float32 or a pure-float64 spelling, and it is
measurable.  Rebuilding the decomposition with each combination:

| `omeg` / `mconv` | `dhdt` | rows differing from GFDRV |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| real(8) | real(8) | 8 |
| real(4) | real(8) | 4 |
| real(8) | real(4) | 14 |
| real(4) | real(4) | 10 |

`mconv`'s own spelling makes no difference; `omeg`'s and `dhdt`'s both do.  No
spelling reaches zero, so the source-faithful real(8) version is what ships
and the residual is recorded.  Choosing the 4-row variant would be fitting the
fixture rather than matching WRF.

Where the difference lands: a uniform 1-2 ULP shift in the deep mass flux
`xmb`, which then scales the whole tendency profile.  It is not a branch flip
-- `ktop`, `kbcon` and `ierr` agree on every one of the 216 rows.  The affected
columns all sit near the `frh_thresh` clamp, where `sig` equals `sig_thresh`
exactly.

The port consequence is concrete: a float32 GF reference must carry `omeg`,
`mconv` and `dhdt` in float64, and must not simplify them to float32
arithmetic.  `woof/verify/gf_ref.py::gf_driver_prep` does, and reproduces
the whole prepared column bitwise on all 216 columns.

### Which double

The stored word and the arithmetic disagree, and the fixture settles it.
Assigned to a real(8) and written out, `con_g` reads `0x40239D0140000000` =
`float64(float32(9.80665))`, not the accurate `0x40239D013A92A305`.  But
reproducing GFDRV needs the accurate double:

| constants used | `omeg` lanes wrong | `dhdt` lanes wrong |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `float64(9.80665)` etc | **0** | **0** |
| `float64(float32(9.80665))` etc | 1488 | 204 |
| float32 throughout | 2700 | 360 |

out of 8640 lanes each.  Every miss is exactly 1 ULP.  `gf-pow-probe.txt`
records the stored word so the trap is visible, and
`tests/test_gf_wrf461_parity.py::test_gfs_constants_are_the_accurate_doubles`
exists so nobody "corrects" the reference back to it.

There is deliberately no micro-probe of the expression in `pow_probe.F90`: a
two-line `-con_g*rho*w` on local operands gets constant-folded by gfortran's
front end at MPFR precision and disagrees with the oracle by 1 ULP on exactly
the discriminating lane.  The 8640-lane fixture is the instrument.


## What the pow/gamma probe measured

All on gfortran 13.3.0 / glibc 2.39, at -O0:

* **`x**.3333` is not a cube root.**  `.3333` is `0x3EAAA64C`; `1./3.` is
  `0x3EAAAAAB`.  They give different answers on 10 of 12 probed x.  The `zws`
  forms (deep :395,:404; sh :307,:316) must be spelled `powf(x, 0.3333f)`.
* **Integer exponents fold exactly.**  `x**2` is bitwise `x*x` and `x**3` is
  bitwise `x*x*x` on all 12 probes and all 12 negative-base probes, despite
  `__powisf2` appearing in `nm -u`.  The port may use multiply chains for
  `(1.-frh)**2`, `US**2`, `t1**2`, `VSHEAR**2` and `VSHEAR**3`.
* **`gamma()` is exactly `tgammaf`.**  gfortran's F2008 intrinsic and glibc's
  `tgammaf` agree bitwise on every argument the scheme can reach (alpha in
  [1.075, 3.7], beta in {1.3, 2.5, 3.5}).  There is no wrapper to model.
* **But `tgammaf` itself is not correctly rounded, and nothing cheap
  reproduces it.**  Phase 2 measured three models against the 51 distinct
  arguments the `pgamma` table reaches: `float32(tgamma_float64(x))` misses
  31, `expf(lgammaf(x))` misses 39, and the exp-lgamma-times-product
  recurrence glibc's own `e_gammaf_r.c` uses misses 32.  All misses are 1-2
  ULP, and the tell is at integer arguments where gamma is exactly
  representable: `gamma(3) = 2` but `tgammaf` returns `40000001`,
  `gamma(4) = 6` but it returns `40C00001`.  The `plgamma` rows print the
  decomposition -- `x`, `gamma(x)`, `log_gamma(x)`, `exp(log_gamma(x))`, the
  product recurrence's split point -- so a later phase can close it without
  re-measuring.

  **THAT PARAGRAPH IS HISTORY AND ITS CONCLUSION IS WITHDRAWN.**  Matching
  `tgammaf` bit for bit means reproducing its rounding errors, and WOOF no
  longer does: its earlier gamma, which returned glibc's words, was replaced
  at 2.7.0 and **must not be brought back**.  WOOF's gamma is now correctly
  rounded -- right where glibc is wrong on 39.44 per cent of [0.25, 36] --
  and the resulting divergence from WRF is a documented deliberate one:
  read `docs/gf_gamma_known_delta.md` before touching anything in this
  paragraph.  The first sentence still stands as a measurement: `tgammaf` is
  not correctly rounded, and that is now the reason to diverge from it rather
  than a gap to close.
* **`powf` is not correctly rounded either**, and the fixture found the one
  argument where it shows.  `powf(0x3F0D923B, 0x3E999998)` -- `(1-kratio) **
  (beta-1)` at level 17 of one column -- has true value
  `0.83718320727036911868...` against a midpoint of
  `0.83718320727348327636...`, so the correctly rounded answer is
  `0x3F5651A3`, by 5.2e-5 of a ULP.  glibc returns `0x3F5651A4`.  The
  `ppowhard` rows record it.  Note they take their operands through
  *variables*: written inline as `transfer(...) ** transfer(...)` the
  expression is a constant expression, gfortran folds it at MPFR precision,
  and the probe prints the correctly rounded answer -- hiding exactly what it
  was built to measure.  That happened once during phase 2; the same trap the
  GFS-constants section records for `-con_g*rho*w`.

### Why the gamma question is not a rounding footnote

**One ULP in `fzu` moves the deep mass flux `xmb` by up to 7.3 per cent**
(median 1.9) on the 60 converged columns.  `cup_forcing_ens_3d` builds every
stability closure as `-xff/xk` with `xk = (xaa0 - aa1)/mbdt`, a difference of
two cloud work functions that agree to several digits and are computed on
states differing only by the `mbdt = .1` perturbation.  A last-bit change in
the mass-flux *shape* walks through `zu` into the vertical integral `aa1`
(450 ULP) and the cancellation in `xk` turns that into per-cent-level `xmb`.
Five to six orders of magnitude of amplification, measured on the fixture and
pinned by
`tests/test_gf_deep_parity.py::test_a_one_ulp_massflux_shape_perturbation_moves_xmb_by_seven_percent`.

The consequence for phase 3 is concrete: **CUDA's `tgammaf` cannot be treated
as a tolerance question.**  If it disagrees with glibc by one ULP the GPU's
deep mass flux disagrees by per cent, not by ULP.  `gf_libm_probe.c` is the
instrument for measuring it.
* **The two constant sets, as float32 bits:** `con_g 411CE80A` vs deep's
  `g 411CF5C3`; `con_cp 447B2666` vs `cp 447B0000`; `con_rv 43E6C000` vs
  `r_v 43E68000`; `con_hvap` and `xlv` agree at `4A189680`.  Three of four
  differ.

## No stub_wrf.F90, on purpose

At `WRF_CHEM = 0` the scheme compiles as it ships.  `module_cu_gf_deep.F` and
`module_cu_gf_sh.F` declare every constant they use as a local `parameter` and
their only `USE` (`module_cu_gf_ctrans`) is inside a `#if ( WRF_CHEM == 1)`
guard.  `module_cu_gf_wrfdrv.F`'s single `USE` is `module_gfs_physcons`, and
that module and the `module_gfs_machine` under it are compiled here from the
same pinned tarball rather than being hand-written stand-ins -- so the
constants are inside the byte pin too.

`nm -u` on the -O0 objects is the receipt: `expf`, `logf`, `powf`, `tgammaf`,
`__powisf2` and libgfortran, nothing else.

## libmvec: GF behaves like Shin-Hong, not like YSU

WRF compiles `phys/` at `-O2 -ftree-vectorize`.  On this toolchain that
setting pulls `_ZGVbN4vv_powf` -- glibc's 4-ULP vector pow -- into
`module_cu_gf_deep.o`, exactly as it does for `module_bl_shinhong.F` and
unlike `bl_ysu.F90`.  WRF's own shipping build therefore genuinely floats some
of GF's pow loops off the scalar reference.  The oracle is built at -O0
(scalar `powf`, the tightest defined reference), `build.sh` fails on any
`_ZGV*` symbol in a reference object, and `libmvec_positive_control.F90`
proves the grep can fire.  `-Ofast` adds nothing further here.

`tgammaf` is new relative to every prior oracle in this repo: `get_zu_zd_pdf_fim`
(module_cu_gf_deep.F:3854) forms `gamma(alpha+beta)/(gamma(alpha)*gamma(beta))`
to normalise the beta-function updraft mass-flux profile.  A CUDA mirror will
have to answer for `tgammaf` ULP, and the arguments are compile-time-constant
combinations of `alpha`/`beta` in most branches, so folding is a live option.

## The WRF driver is the fixture boundary, on purpose

`GFDRV` is pinned rather than `cup_gf`, so everything the driver does to build
the column is inside the fixture:

* the Pa -> mb conversion on `p` and `p8w` (:385, :404);
* the `1.e-8` floors on `q2d` and `qo` (:411, :419) and the `TN < 200` reset
  (:418);
* the `zo` half-layer stack from `dz8w` (:396-399);
* `omeg = -g*rho*w` (:471) with `g` taken from `module_gfs_physcons`
  (`con_g = 9.80665`), NOT the solver's `9.81`;
* `mconv` as the column integral of `omeg*dq/g` clipped at zero (:484-492);
* `dhdt = cp*rthblten*pi + xlv*rqvblten` (:416) with `cp = con_cp = 1004.6`,
  NOT the deep module's own `cp = 1004.`;
* the `cuten`/`cutens`/`cutenm` gating and the `/pi` division that turn
  `outt` into `RTHCUTEN` (:745-752);
* the `t2d < 258` split of `RQCCUTEN`/`RQICUTEN` and of `GDC`/`GDC2`
  (:820-840).

The constant disagreement is real: the driver's `g`, `cp`, `xlv` and `r_v` are
GFS values (`9.80665`, `1004.6`, `2.5e6`, `461.5`) while `module_cu_gf_deep.F`
and `module_cu_gf_sh.F` each declare their own (`9.81`, `1004.`, `2.5e6`,
`461.`).  A port must reproduce both sets in the places WRF uses them.

## The tile geometry is essential

GFDRV computes its own write window as `ibegc = max(its, ids+4)`,
`iendc = min(ite, ide-5)`, `jbegc = max(jts, jds+4)`, `jendc = min(jte, jde-5)`
in the non-periodic case (:264-277), and `go to 100`s the entire j when j
falls outside it (:712).  A tile that ignores that returns all zeros without
any error.  The oracle sizes its domain so every active column lands inside
the window; a port must honour the same four-cell inset or it will silently
disagree with WRF at every domain edge.

## Column independence, measured

Every case is run twice: packed into one 18-column slab, and alone in a
one-column tile.  `gf-isolation.csv` records **0 differing output words in all
216 (case, dx, arm) combinations** -- GF at the GFDRV boundary is bitwise
column-independent, which is the precondition for a one-column-per-thread GPU
mapping.  This is a measurement on this fixture, not a proof over all inputs;
the closure ensemble carries `itf`-wide loops that a future case could in
principle couple.

## Fixture coverage

18 cases x 6 grid spacings x 2 `ishallow` arms, chosen to reach branches
rather than to look meteorological.

dx sweep `1000 / 4000 / 6000 / 9000 / 15000 / 27000` m against
module_cu_gf_deep.F:463-469: with `csum = 0` and `imid = 0` the deep
entrainment rate is `7.e-5`, so `radius = .2/entr = 2857.14` m and
`frh = min(1, 3.14*radius^2/dx^2)` hits the `frh_thresh = .9` clamp below
about 5337 m.  1000 and 4000 sit inside the clamp, where `sig` equals
`sig_thresh = .01` exactly -- the value the deep-shutoff test at :663
compares against; 6000 is just outside; 9000/15000/27000 walk `sig` up
toward 1.

Cases 1-12 target the deep scheme: tropical maritime deep convection;
continental deep convection over land; a strongly capped column; a
shallow-cumulus regime under a sharp 1.4 km inversion; marginal weak forcing;
a cold dry stable column that never convects; a dry mid-level layer to drive
the downdraft/`edt` path; strong moisture convergence for the Krishnamurti
closure limb; `kpbl` at the floor (2) and halfway up the column (20);
`hfx = qfx = 0` exactly, so `ztexec` and `zqexec` both vanish; and a nocturnal
land column with negative `hfx` and `qfx`.

Cases 13-18 were built against the shallow trigger specifically, which is not
the deep trigger: `k22` is the level of maximum moist static energy below
`kbmax` (module_cu_gf_sh.F:376), `cap_max` collapses to `po_cup(kpbl)` as soon
as `kpbl > 3` (:371), and `ktop` comes either from `get_inversion_layers`' 800
hPa slot or from 200 hPa above `kbcon`.  They hold the moisture maximum at the
surface, keep `kpbl` low, and put a real second-derivative feature where the
shallow `ktop` search looks: trade cumulus under a 900 m inversion; the same
regime at 2.2 km; a continental shallow column; a hard 8 K
stratocumulus-to-cumulus cap; a weak-forcing shallow column; and a shallow
column under strong shear.  The capping inversion is a logistic step rather
than a Gaussian bump for the same reason -- `get_inversion_layers` locks onto
local minima of `|d2T/dz2|`, and a smooth hump does not give it one.

What the capture reached: 84 of 216 (case, dx, arm) rows produce
precipitation; `CUP_gf_sh` fires on 5 cases x 6 dx = 30 of the 108 arm-1 rows
(it reached 2 cases before the shallow-targeted soundings were added);
`ktop_deep` spans 0 / 24 / 28 / 30 / 31; both sides of the 258 K ice split
fire; and no output word is NaN anywhere.

Read the shallow number as **5 distinct answers**, not 30 rows: see "the
shallow capture has no dx axis" above.  16 of the 18 cases reach the `SH2`
mass-flux profile even though only 5 survive to a tendency, so the branch
coverage inside the routine is much wider than the convergence count.

## The per-stage parity table

Every row is `woof/verify` against this oracle, on the fixture's own columns,
graded by `tests/test_gf_wrf461_parity.py`, `tests/test_gf_deep_parity.py`,
`tests/test_gf_shallow_parity.py` and `tests/test_gf_driver_parity.py`.
"bitwise" means max_ulp 0 on every field of the stage, on every column
compared.

| stage | source | reference | columns | result |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| driver preparation | wrfdrv:383-492 | `gf_ref.gf_driver_prep` | 216 | bitwise |
| deep cloud model | deep:39-1868 + 15 procedures | `gf_deep_body`, `gf_deep_ref` | 216 | bitwise with `fzu` pinned; `tgammaf` model costs up to 7.3% of `xmb` |
| shallow: w*, cap, k22, `cup_kbcon` iloop 5 | sh:299-407 | `gf_shallow_ref` | 18 | bitwise |
| shallow: `cup_minimi`, `get_inversion_layers`, first `ktop` | sh:409-449 | `gf_shallow_ref`, `gf_deep_ref` | 18 | bitwise |
| shallow: `rates_up_pdf` / `SH2` | deep:3697-3895 | `gf_deep_ref.rates_up_pdf_shallow` | 16 reach it | shape params bitwise; `fzu` up to 4 ULP |
| shallow: `get_lateral_massflux`, updraft, moisture | sh:490-611 | `gf_shallow_ref` | 18 | bitwise with `fzu` pinned |
| shallow: `cup_up_aa0`, dellas, perturbed state | sh:615-810 | `gf_shallow_ref` | 18 | bitwise with `fzu` pinned |
| shallow: the three-closure average | sh:817-874 | `gf_shallow_ref` | 18 | bitwise with `fzu` pinned; modelled `fzu` costs up to 8.4e-3 of `xmb` |
| `neg_check` (both arms) | deep:3038-3102 | `gf_deep_ref.neg_check` | 216 | bitwise |
| driver output algebra | wrfdrv:713-840 | `gf_driver.gf_driver_output` | 216 | bitwise |
| **GFDRV end to end** | wrfdrv:1-844 | `gf_driver.gfdrv_column` | 216 | **bitwise on 208**; the other 8 are the driver's own mixed precision, see below |

The end-to-end row is the one that matters and it needs its exact wording.
With `fzu` pinned, the reference reproduces GFDRV word for word -- all eight
level fields and five surface fields -- on the 208 columns where the driver's
own decomposition is exact: 67600 words, zero differing.  The other 8 columns
are exactly `gf_oracle.stage_rows_to_distrust`, i.e. the same rows where
`run_cup_gf.F90`'s reconstruction of this algebra also disagrees with GFDRV.
The port adds nothing there: on **all 216** columns it reproduces the stage
path -- preparation, both schemes, both `neg_check` calls, all ten
post-`neg_check` tendency fields and both precipitation rates -- bitwise, so
the residual is entirely the driver's.  `GDC`, `GDC2`, `HTOP`, `HBOT`,
`ktop_deep` and the shallow diagnostics are bitwise on all 216 because none of
them carries `xmb`.

One thing the end-to-end gate found that neither stage gate could: with
`tgammaf` modelled rather than pinned, `RTHCUTEN` moves by **more than 100 per
cent on one lane**.  Normalised by the column's own peak the error is 7.3 per
cent -- exactly the deep `xmb` residual, because the tendency profile is
linear in `xmb` -- but on the `ishallow = 1` arm the shallow and deep
tendencies have opposite signs at some levels, so wrfdrv:747 sums two numbers
that nearly cancel and a sub-per-cent shift in either mass flux is
order-unity in their difference.  A third cancellation, on top of `xk`'s.  No
branch flips: `ierr`, `ktop_deep`, `ktop_shallow`, `cuten` and `cutens` are
identical between the two runs on all 216 columns.

## What the driver does after the schemes return

Worth stating separately because it is where a composition mistake lives, and
none of it is visible from either cloud model.

* **Three gating scalars, not one.**  `cutens` starts at 1 and is knocked to 0
  by `ishallow_g3 == 0` (:331) OR by `xmbs <= 0` (:525) -- decided from the
  mass flux, *before* `neg_check` touches `prets`.  `cuten` is 1 if and only
  if the deep arm precipitated (:727), and the `else` limb ZEROES `kbcon` and
  `ktop`, so a deep cloud that formed and did not rain is erased from the
  diagnostics as well as from the tendencies.  `ktop_deep` is read at :726
  from the un-zeroed `ktop`, so the diagnostic and the gate disagree by
  design.
* **Ordering.**  `neg_check` runs on the shallow tendencies at :527, before
  `cup_gf` is called at :627.  The deep arm sees an already-rescaled `prets`.
* `RTHCUTEN` is the only output divided by the Exner function (:747).
* The `t2d < 258` split (:820-840) routes ONE condensate number to either
  `RQICUTEN` or `RQCCUTEN` and one in-cloud water to either `GDC2` or `GDC`.
  `RQCCUTEN`, `GDC` and `GDC2` are written twice -- once unconditionally at
  :813-815 and again inside the split -- and the second write wins on every
  level.  The split is on `t2d`, the UNforced temperature, not on `tn`.
* `PRATEC` is gated by an OR over all three precipitation rates (:800), so a
  column where only the shallow arm rained still gets `RAINCV`.
* `HBOT` is initialised to `REAL(KTE)` and `HTOP` to `REAL(KTS)` (:349-350).
  The crossing is not a typo to fix: an untouched column reports HTOP 1 and
  HBOT 40.

## Not covered, deliberately or otherwise

* **`xmb_shallow` does not move with dx.**  That is the scheme, not the
  fixture: the `sig` factor lives only in `cup_output_ens_3d` (:3276, :3344)
  on the deep/mid path.  `CUP_gf_sh` has no scale-awareness in v4.6.1, and
  no `dx` argument either.  `gf-shallow-consistency.csv` now proves the
  whole shallow answer is dx-free, not just `xmb`, and `build.sh` fails if
  that stops being true.
* **`SH3` is dead** and `MID` is reachable only from the dead `imid = 1`
  arm, so `get_zu_zd_pdf_fim` has two live branches out of five.  `SH3` has
  no call site anywhere in the three modules.
* **Four shallow rejection paths are transcribed and unexercised** on this
  fixture: `ierr` 2 (`k22 > kbmax`), 17 (shallow cloud work function zero),
  41 (`ktop <= kbcon+2` in `rates_up_pdf`) and 231 (`kbcon > ktf-4`).  The
  parity gate asserts each of them is unreached rather than leaving it
  implicit, so a later case table that reaches one is a visible change.
* **So is the `ktop > ki+1` re-topping at module_cu_gf_sh.F:533**, and that
  one is the scheme rather than the case table.  Two soundings were built
  against it and neither fired.  `ktop` comes from `get_inversion_layers`'
  shallow slot, and an inversion IS a moist-static-energy barrier, so the
  level the inversion search picks and the level `hco - heso_cup` changes
  sign at are the same feature: `ktop` lands at `ki` or `ki+1` by
  construction on every converged column.  Decoupling them needs :441-447's
  other arm, where `ktop` comes from pressure alone, which needs the only
  second-derivative feature to sit more than 200 mb above cloud base -- and
  the attempt at that found `get_inversion_layers` latching onto float32
  curvature noise in the nominally straight part of the profile instead.
  `gf_column` cannot currently build a column with no low-level feature at
  all.
* **`imid_gf = 0` is a hard-coded parameter** (module_cu_gf_wrfdrv.F:69), so
  the entire mid-level arm -- the second `cup_gf` call, `ichoicem`,
  `dicycle_m`, `outtm`/`outqm`/`cupclwm`, `neg_check('mid')` -- is dead code
  in WRF's GF as shipped.  So are `ideep` (fixed 1), `ichoice_s` (fixed 0),
  `dicycle` (fixed 1) and `aodccn`.  The oracle does not reach them because
  WRF cannot.
* **`gfinit` (module_cu_gf_deep.F:4337) is dead code.**  `module_physics_init.F:4103`
  routes `CASE (G3SCHEME, GFSCHEME)` to `g3init`, from `module_cu_g3`, not to
  GF's own initialiser.
* **`DERIV3` (module_cu_gf_deep.F:4161) is dead code too**, and more
  completely: `grep -n deriv3` over all three GF modules finds the definition
  and nothing else.  Nothing in WRF calls it.  It is a three-point Lagrange
  derivative that `get_inversion_layers` was presumably meant to use and does
  not -- that routine spells its own first and second differences inline
  (:4087, :4092).
* **`get_inversion_layers` reads one element past `t_cup`'s upper bound.**
  Its loop runs `k = kts+1, kend+7` and reads `t_cup(i,k+1)`, so it touches
  index `kend+8`; both live call sites (module_cu_gf_sh.F:413 and the dead
  `imid == 1` arm at :690) pass `kend = kstabi`, which `cup_minimi` bounds
  only by `ktf-1 = 39`.  With `kte = 40` any column whose `kstabi` exceeds 32
  reads off the end.  `run_gf_stages` clamps `kend` to `ktf-8` and counts the
  clamps rather than capturing an undefined read; on this fixture the count is
  **0**, so the capture is the defined answer everywhere and the divergence is
  recorded, not exercised.
* **The chem arm.**  `module_cu_gf_ctrans.F` is pinned for the record but not
  compiled; WOOF has no chemistry.
* **`WRF_DFI_RADAR = 1` cap suppression.**  Not built.
* **`spp_conv = 1`.**  The stochastic-perturbation arm is passed as present
  but off.  Note that `pattern_spp_conv` is declared `(ims:ime, kms:kme,
  jms:jme)` and then indexed `(i, n, j)` for `n = 1..4` (:312) -- the K
  dimension is being reused as a four-slot pattern index.  A port must not
  "fix" that.

## Optional arguments WRF cannot actually omit

`GFDRV` declares `RTHCUTEN`, `RQVCUTEN`, `DUDT_PHY`, `DVDT_PHY`, `ktop_deep`,
`RTHFTEN`, `RQVFTEN`, `RTHRATEN`, `rthblten` and `rqvblten` `OPTIONAL`, then
references every one of them unconditionally (:296-301 zero the tendencies,
:412-417 read the forcing arrays, :726 writes `ktop_deep`).  Formal absence of
any of them is an illegal reference the moment the driver runs, and WRF's own
`module_cumulus_driver.F:1292` always passes all of them.  The oracle does
too; the port treats them as required and documents the formal-optionality gap
rather than implementing an arm WRF cannot reach.  This is the same finding
the Shin-Hong oracle recorded for `ctopo`/`ctopo2`/`regime`.

`RQCCUTEN`, `RQICUTEN`, `GDC`, `GDC2` and the four shallow diagnostics ARE
guarded by `PRESENT` and are genuinely optional.

## Reproducibility

`build.sh` run twice from scratch into two separate build directories
produced byte-identical output for all thirteen data files.  The digests in
`oracle-sha256sums.txt` are that answer.

One negative control worth recording: filling the scratch arrays GFDRV never
initialises (`cnvwt`, `zus`, `zu`, `zd`, `edt` -- the driver passes them as
`intent(inout)` automatics without zeroing them) with a large sentinel instead
of zero changed nothing in the stage fixture.  GF writes all of them before
reading, so the uninitialised pass-through is harmless.  `cnvwts` is declared
in GFDRV (:202) and never used at all: the shallow call receives the deep
`cnvwt` array (:514).
