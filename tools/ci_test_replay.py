"""Replay the publish workflow's ``test`` job against any source tree.

The job this replays (.github/workflows/publish.yml, job ``test``) is the
package/contract surface a public cut can break on a GPU-less runner, and
it runs against the PUBLIC source tree -- which lawfully lacks the
size-externalized Thompson tables the private tree carries.  Nothing else
in this repository executes that job's exact motions locally, so a public
checkout that fails it is discovered on the first real cut instead of
here.  This script is the local twin:

    fresh venv
      -> python -m pip install build setuptools
      -> python -m build --outdir <work>/companion-dist <tree>/recast-woof-data
      -> python -m pip install <that wheel>
      -> WOOF_ALLOW_UNPINNED_WHEEL=1 python -m pip install -e "<tree>[dev]"
      -> python -m pytest -q -m "<marker filter>" <the job's test files>

The test-file list and the ``-m`` filter are PARSED OUT OF publish.yml,
never restated, so this replay cannot drift behind the job it replays.

Two properties of the CI runner are recreated deliberately, because each
one changed a test's verdict when it was missing:

* **A clean home.**  The runner's home directory carries no ``~/.woof``;
  a developer box does, and a stale staged bridge there turned
  ``doctor``'s engine probe from a skip into a failure that names this
  machine, not the tree.  The whole replay runs under a fresh
  ``HOME``/``USERPROFILE`` inside the workdir.
* **A git checkout.**  ``actions/checkout`` always delivers a repository;
  a plain export is not one, and ``doctor``'s run-provenance check
  rightly reports an identityless tree as ``missing``.  A tree handed in
  without ``.git`` is ``git init``-ed and committed in place, locally,
  with a throwaway identity and no remote.
* **An interpreter that carries setuptools.**  CI pins 3.11, whose
  environment ships it; ``python -m venv`` on 3.12+ does not (PEP 632).
  Two of the job's own test files drive setuptools to measure what the
  wheel would contain and refuse when it is absent, so on a 3.12+ box the
  replay went red on its own venv while the job it replays was fine.
  See :data:`VENV_SEEDS`.

The tree is mutated exactly as the job mutates its checkout (the
editable install writes ``gpuwm.egg-info/`` into it) plus that local
``git init``; to replay against a pristine snapshot, copy the snapshot
first and hand the copy in.

Usage:
    python tools/ci_test_replay.py <source-tree> [--workdir DIR] [--keep]
        [--python EXE]

Exit status is pytest's, so 0 means the job's test leg would have passed.
