# Per-kernel aerosol oracle receipts

Byte receipts for the Fortran output the three committed aerosol probes
produce, so a regeneration can be compared without diffing megabytes of CSV.
The CSVs themselves are **not** committed: they are 12 MB of derived data that
the committed sources reproduce exactly, and the point of this file is that
"exactly" is checkable.

Environment for every number below:

| item | value |
| --- | --- |
| WRF | v4.6.1, commit `d66e442fccc04111067e29274c9f9eaccc3cef28`, unmodified |
| compiler | GNU Fortran 13.3.0, `-O2 -ffree-form -ffree-line-length-none`, baseline x86-64 (no FMA instruction) |
| host | Ubuntu 24.04 on WSL2, x86-64 |
| date | 2026-07-31 |
| tables | the four classic assets pinned by `thompson_contract.py`, plus `CCN_ACTIVATE.BIN` at `f2b8d391…` |

## `build_aero_probes.sh`: `probe-oracle-aero/`

| file | rows | sha256 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `aero-warm-rates.csv` | 12348 | `7477a384cb7c8e4710c1f2bf13b7e27fa0428c76a683dd80bd25388e40968cab` |
| `aero-ncten-balance.csv` | 11025 | `40a41d6a296f90bf587991223ad130c6af85c1bcc5fdaf4871b740333fdad225` |
| `aero-cold-warm-loop.csv` | 11340 | `fff44927dab5e89aef7b5b879a10875741f2492212c587a2df619c1c9462c3a2` |

The first two digests are also the digests of the pre-existing scratch output
that produced `_WARM_RATE_ORACLE` and `_NCTEN_BALANCE_ORACLE`, which is what
makes `probe_warm_rates_aero.F90` a *recovery* rather than a reconstruction.
`aero-cold-warm-loop.csv` has no such predecessor (its driver was lost) so
its digest pins this repository's reconstruction, not the original run.  See
the header of `probe_cold_warm_loop_aero.F90`.

## `build_aero_instrumented.sh`: `intermediates/`

Only the files the committed tests consume are listed; the script emits one
per scenario per anchor.

A digest mismatch here is not automatically a defect (a different gfortran
version legitimately moves the last digits) but it does mean the two
verification scripts must be re-run and believed instead of these receipts:

    python3 check_probe_oracles_aero.py       <build>/probe-oracle-aero
    python3 check_instrumented_tables_aero.py <build>/intermediates

Both compare against the literals the tests actually assert, so they are the
authority; this file is a shortcut, not a substitute.
