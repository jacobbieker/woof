"""Which committed aerosol fixtures does a GPU comparison actually read?

A fixture that is hash-pinned but never compared is coverage a reader will
assume they have.  The mp=8 deck has one: `mixed-surface.csv` is pinned by
`tests/test_thompson_oracle_provenance.py` and consumed by no GPU
comparison, so perturbing every field in it by 1% passes the entire mp=8
tier.  This script asks the same question of the 50 aerosol fixtures the way
that one was answered -- by perturbation, not by reading imports.

For each CSV: multiply every numeric field by 1.01 (zeros become 1e-30), run
the mp=28 device tier with -x, restore the original bytes, and record whether
anything failed.  The restore is asserted byte-for-byte before moving on, and
runs in a `finally`, so an interrupted sweep cannot leave a perturbed fixture
behind.

MEASURED on 2026-08-02, one RTX 5090, against the committed deck:
**50 of 50 consumed, none unconsumed.**  The aerosol deck has no equivalent
of the mp=8 gap.

Usage (needs a CUDA device and a staged CCN_ACTIVATE.BIN):

    python tools/thompson_wrf461_oracle/measure_aero_fixture_coverage.py

Takes roughly 45 minutes: one full device-tier run per fixture.
