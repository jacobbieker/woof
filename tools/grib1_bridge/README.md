# woof native GRIB bridges

One Rust crate (`grib1_bridge`, library name `gpuwm_preprocess_cpu`) holding
every CPU-side GRIB decode boundary woof uses.  `woof.ingest.grib`,
`woof.ingest.hrrr`, and `woof.gfs_direct` consume the raw little-endian
arrays and JSON/TSV metadata these binaries write; no ecCodes, cfgrib, or C
runtime is required anywhere.

## Prerequisites

- A Rust toolchain (stable; `cargo` on PATH).  <https://rustup.rs> installs
  it on every platform woof targets; no nightly features are used.
- Nothing else -- no network access included.  The hardened `grib-core`
  decoder and every crates.io transitive dependency are checked in under
  `vendor/` (provenance in `vendor/VENDOR.md`), so a clean clone builds
  without a user-specific path and without touching the network.

## Build

From the repository root:

```powershell
Push-Location tools/grib1_bridge
cargo build --release --locked --offline
Pop-Location
```

The command is intentionally run *in* `tools/grib1_bridge`, where Cargo finds
the checked-in source-replacement configuration in `.cargo/config.toml`
(crates.io is replaced by the `vendor/crates-io` directory).

## Where the binaries land

Everything is written to `tools/grib1_bridge/target/release/` (with an
`.exe` suffix on Windows).  Binaries are **not** committed -- `target/` is
gitignored -- so `cargo build --release` is a required step of any clean
clone that ingests GRIB sources.  The clean-clone rule is:
`pip install recast-woof` + this one cargo build + the documented data fetch.

| Binary | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `grib1_bridge` | ERA5 GRIB1 decode boundary.  Validates every concatenated GRIB1 envelope (declared length, edition, `7777` terminator, exact EOF coverage) before decode, writes every decoded message to one little-endian float64 stream, and records message/grid metadata in JSON.  `woof.ingest.grib` applies `Vtable.ERA5_CDO` and assembles snapshots.  Usage: `grib1_bridge INPUT.grb OUTPUT_DIR`. |
| `gfs_grib2_bridge` | Fail-closed companion for GFS-container `pgrb2.0p25` series.  Accepts a `HOUR<TAB>GRIB2<TAB>FORECAST_PROCESS_ID` manifest (legacy two-column rows declare analysis process 81 only), inventories the whole series before publication, selects 124 records per time by raw GRIB2 identifiers, validates the NCEP/table/declared-process identity, exact 0.25-degree grid endpoints, cycle/cadence/packing/missing-value policies, WPS-compatible RH2 and LANDN-with-LAND-fallback semantics, and both fixed surfaces for the four exact Noah soil layers.  Terrain and the selected land mask must remain bit-identical across the series.  Writes little-endian FP32 regular-grid arrays consumed directly by `woof.gfs_direct`; no `.rws`, WPS, or `real.exe` step is involved. |
| `hrrr_grib2_bridge` | Fail-closed native HRRR GRIB2 subset bridge for woof initialization.  Accepts one contiguous public source-lead window from a single HRRR cycle, proves the exact atmosphere/surface/soil inventory the initialization lane needs (no field selected by display name or message position), and writes a south-to-north row-major FP32 source window read by `woof.ingest.hrrr`. |
| `grib2_inventory` | Strict GRIB2 inventory/decode probe.  Emits one TSV row per message (raw identifiers, grid definition, packing, decode statistics) -- the manifest/receipt tool for auditing what a downloaded GRIB2 file actually contains before anything ingests it. |
| `grib2_dump` | Dumps selected GRIB2 fields as little-endian float64 with a TSV header, for decoder cross-checks against independent readers. |

The ERA5 bridge also accepts `grib1_bridge --inventory INPUT.grb`. It
writes versioned JSON message headers to stdout using the same native
section parser as normal decode, retaining one packed message at a time.
It does not unpack field values or coordinate arrays. The wizard uses this
mode to measure supplied forcing times before fitting a grid. A failed
command's partial stdout is not a usable inventory; complete field and
spatial validation still belongs to normal input preflight.

## The CPU preprocessing library

The same crate builds `gpuwm_preprocess_cpu` (`libgpuwm_preprocess_cpu.so`,
`gpuwm_preprocess_cpu.dll`), which `woof.ingest.cpu_backend` loads through
ctypes.  Besides the horizontal, vertical and WRF-real transforms of the CPU
preprocessing backend, it carries `gpuwm_wps_masked_chain_f64` and
`gpuwm_wps_land_unit_scan_f64` (`src/wps_masked.rs`): WPS metgrid's masked
chain for soil moisture and temperature, snow, skin temperature and sea ice,
in float64, parallel across target cells with a result that does not depend
on the worker count.  BOTH preprocessing backends map those fields through
it, so a library without the entry is refused by name.  Its values and
repair counts are byte-identical to the NumPy transcription kept as the test
oracle (`woof/verify/wps_masked_oracle.py`); the search takes its walk
once per start cell and squares a distance as `dx * dx`, as the oracle's
shared-walk search does.

`gpuwm_masked_bilinear_stencil_f64` and `gpuwm_masked_stencil_apply_f32`
(`src/masked_stencil.rs`) build and apply the land-only bilinear stencil of
the native HRRR route: surface-matched corner weights, the nearest land
donor for a land cell with none, and the report's counts, byte-identical to
the NumPy builder kept as its test oracle
(`woof/verify/hrrr_stencil_oracle.py`).

`src/water_blend.rs` carries the water surfaces: `gpuwm_lake_water_nearest_f64`
(the search for the nearest source water cell of each model lake, whose
stopping bound is squared with the C library's `pow` as Python's `** 2`
does), `gpuwm_masked_bilinear_blend_f64` (the bilinear blend renormalised
over the water donors that exist), `gpuwm_component_fill_f64` (the
four-neighbour sweep that closes a water body's holes from its own cells),
`gpuwm_overlay_bilinear_sample_f64` (the corner blend of a
water-temperature overlay) and `gpuwm_label_components_8` (the 8-connected
labelling of water bodies, one thread, labels in the row-major order of each
body's first cell).  Each is byte-identical to the NumPy code kept
as its test oracle (`woof/verify/water_blend_oracle.py`) at any worker
count, and a library without them is refused by name.

`src/water_repair.rs` carries the rest of the water-temperature assembly:
`gpuwm_water_repair_f64` (the box repairs of water cells whose provider left
no admissible temperature: ring by ring from the body's own water, else the
nearest admissible water, else the surrounding skin) and
`gpuwm_water_bodies_f64` (the per-body loop: each body's cells, donors,
renormalised blend, coverage, hole fill and provider in one pass instead of
whole-domain masks once per body).  Both are byte-identical to the NumPy
code kept in the same oracle, the old assembly loop included, at any worker
count.

`src/water_owner.rs` carries `gpuwm_component_owner_f64`: which water body
owns each source cell (the body holding most of the targets nearest to it,
and among equal claims the highest label), the donor sets of the per-body
assembly.  `src/surface_nearest.rs` carries `gpuwm_masked_nearest_f32`, the
CPU backend's bounded surface-nearest search in float32 (the first of
equally near cells in its scan wins), and is the library's newest entry: the
ABI marker `woof.bridges` checks.  Both are byte-identical to the NumPy code
kept in the same oracle at any worker count.

## Validation posture

Every bridge is fail-closed: unexpected editions, grids, packing, missing
records, or inventory drift abort with a receipt instead of publishing a
partial product.  Upstream provenance of the vendored decoder is recorded in
`vendor/VENDOR.md`.
