//! Quantization-aware bound handling shared by the GRIB2 bridges.
//!
//! Every scaled GRIB2 data-representation template reconstructs a value
//! as `Y = (R + X * 2^E) * 10^-D`.  The representable values therefore
//! sit on a grid whose spacing is `2^E * 10^-D`, and the encoder picks
//! `X` by rounding, so a quantity that is physically AT a limit --
//! saturated soil, ice-free ocean, snow-free ground -- can decode to a
//! value a fraction of one step on the wrong side of that limit.  That
//! is a statement about the packing, not about the data.
//!
//! So a bound that real data legitimately sits on is declared
//! [`BoundKind::Physical`], and a decoded value that overshoots it by no
//! more than the record's own decode quantum is clamped back onto the
//! bound, counted, and reported.  Everything else refuses exactly as
//! before: a slack plausibility range is never widened, and an
//! excursion larger than the derived tolerance is still data corruption.
//!
//! The tolerance cannot be talked upward by a record's own header.  It
//! is confined to a band that is physically negligible against the
//! field's declared range ([`MIN_RELATIVE_TOLERANCE`] ..
//! [`MAX_RELATIVE_TOLERANCE`]), so a coarsely packed record -- one whose
//! quantum is a sizeable fraction of the field's range, or one whose
//! template carries no scale at all -- buys no extra room.
