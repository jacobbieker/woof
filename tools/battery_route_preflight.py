"""Ask every static gate on the HRRR run route about ONE experiment config.

The observation battery composes case configs and runs them through
``tools/prepared_domain_tree_forecast.py`` over an HRRR-prepared root.
That route is guarded by four independent admission gates that live in
four modules and fire at four different costs:

===========================================  ==============================
gate                                          when it fires today
===========================================  ==============================
``woof.config.validate_run_config``          config load
``woof.config.validate_run_preparation``     experiment dispatch, and
                                              as a floor at real
                                              initialization
``woof.hrrr_route_inputs``                   wizard emission
``physics_compat`` single-domain profile      root preparation (after fetch)
``woof.hrrr_hierarchy_direct``               tree assembly (after prepare)
===========================================  ==============================

The second row is the reason this list grew.  Whether a dataset or a
table set is INSTALLED is a question about the machine, not about the
configuration, so ``validate_run_config`` -- which is also the namelist
importer's battery, and that door translates a file and runs nothing --
deliberately does not ask it.  The doors that commit to building a
forecast do, before they fetch anything
(``woof.config.validate_experiment_preparation``, called by ``woof
go``'s stage composer and by the experiment run dispatch), and the real
initializer keeps the per-domain raise as a floor.  This tool asks the
same code object on the same side of the download, so a battery config
gets the answer in a receipt rather than in a refusal.

The expensive ones are the last two: a suite the root preparer refuses is
refused AFTER 10-15 GB of HRRR has been fetched and decoded, and a suite
the hierarchy gate refuses is refused after the root preparation has been
paid for as well.  This tool asks all four in one CPU-side pass, before
anything is fetched, and prints the refusal each one WOULD raise -- the
same code objects the route calls, never a restatement of their rules.

It also prices the run: device-memory envelope from the product's own
allocation estimator, and wall-clock/output projections scaled from the
committed 3 km anchor receipt
(``docs/public/receipts/obsbattery/grounding-3km-conus-run-report.json``),
which is the only in-tree measurement of this engine at this resolution.

Exit status is 0 when every gate admits the config and 1 when any refuses,
so this is usable as the campaign's pre-launch check.
