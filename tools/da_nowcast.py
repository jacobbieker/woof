"""One front door: any WSR-88D site + a time window -> a cycled nowcast.

``python -m tools.da_nowcast run --site XXXX --window-end <ISO|latest>``
runs the whole live-fire pipeline that round 3 proved, site-parameterized
end to end:

    survey   S3 listing, freshness/lag measurement, echo census, storm
             motion from volume-to-volume centroid displacement
    domain   a range-authority-sized box sited on the echo with
             downstream room, emitted by the ``woof domain`` wizard
             (never hand-typed namelists)
    prepare  authority -> fetch -> manifest -> prepared cache, on THIS
             box (prepared cases are host-bound; a receipted finding)
    obs      one ``gpuwm-obs.radar-grid.v1`` file per cycle via the
             rw_nexrad seam (``tools/obs_radar_grid_build.py``), built
             from one radar or several (``--sites``/``--discover-sites``)
    cycle    N-member cycled GPU LETKF with free forecast legs
             (``tools/da_cycle_prepared.py``)
    render   the map-styled gallery (``tools/da_nowcast_render.py``)

``--site`` is the ANCHOR radar: it sites the domain and names the case.
``--sites XXXX`` (repeatable) adds radars to every observation the run
builds, and ``--discover-sites`` computes them from the domain's own
georeference instead.  One radar measures the wind along its own beam
and nothing else; two whose coverage overlaps constrain what neither
can alone.  The selection is recorded in the receipt under ``radars``,
and the rolling verifier reads it back -- so the observed composites a
case is GRADED against are built from the same radars it ASSIMILATED,
which is the difference between verification and flattery.

Verification is AUTOMATIC: when a run completes, the front door spawns
a detached rolling verifier (``watch`` mode) that polls the archive,
builds each free-forecast frame's observed composite as its valid time
gets covered, re-renders the gallery in place (counts + FSS on every
pair), and exits once the last frame verifies -- the nowcast grades
itself as reality arrives, with no further command.  ``--no-verify``
opts out.  ``python -m tools.da_nowcast verify --case-dir DIR`` remains
as a one-shot re-grade of an existing case directory.

The receipt carries the verification state machine for tooling to
poll: ``verification.state`` is ``pending`` (not started yet),
``rolling`` (a detached verifier is grading), ``complete`` (every
free-forecast frame carries numbers), ``incomplete`` (the verifier
stopped with frames the archive never covered), or ``disabled``
(``--no-verify``).  Beside it sit a verdict line, the watcher's pid
and log, and one entry per frame with its status and its numbers.

Every stage is an existing shipped tool driven over its CLI; this file
adds planning, siting, and receipts.  Each stage writes a versioned JSON
receipt under ``<out>/receipts/`` and the run ends with a
``nowcast-receipt.json`` (schema ``gpuwm-da.nowcast.v1``) -- the seam a
GUI drives later.

ACCURACY: this is a demo-grade nowcast.  UNSCORED, outside any registered
campaign, EXPERIMENTAL like every tool it drives.  No skill claim is
made or implied; the gallery says so on every figure.

No radar-site names belong in this file, its defaults, or its
identifiers: sites, times and buckets are arguments (standing owner
rule).

#: The N=10 -> N=20 gain does not survive its own noise.  With the
#: averaging depth held at 10 for both (so only analysis quality
#: varies) it is +0.0018; per member, the statistic averaging cannot
#: flatter, it is +0.0038 -- against an across-member FSS scatter of
#: 0.0062 at N=10 and 0.0074 at N=20, i.e. larger than the effect
#: (evidence/da-demo/ensemble-size-sweep/skill-decomposition-partial.json).

#: on the ensemble MEAN composite, and holding the analysis fixed while
#: deepening the average LOWERS FSS monotonically, 0.7470 at depth 1 to
#: 0.7423 at depth 20, because these forecasts already under-produce
#: echo (~2000 columns >=35 dBZ against ~2800 observed) and smoothing

#: It was ``wsm6-ysu-mm5-noah-no-radiation-v1`` until 2026-08-09: the
#: lw-off / sw-on pairing, shipped as the DEFAULT of a storm-scale
#: nowcast product whose cases are overwhelmingly nocturnal, while
#: docs/public/PHYSICS.md stated in as many words that "no door emits an
#: asymmetric pairing as a default".  This door is what made that
#: sentence false.  Nothing computed the downward longwave, so every
#: member of every cycle ran its land surface against a sky no scheme
#: produced -- and the nocturnal guard stayed silent on the emitted case
#: because ``woof domain`` had written the declaration into it on the
#: user's behalf.
#:
#: The nowcast background is HRRR by default (project ruling, 2026-08-06),
#: so this named product follows the HRRR route's authoritative suite.

#: (evidence/16gb-frontier/runs/f198n10/vram.json): whole-card peak
#: 15,888 MiB -- 97.0% of the card, 488 MiB of headroom -- against a
#: MEDIAN of 2,168 MiB.  The spike is the solve, not the forecast legs.
#:
#: Peak does not scale with ensemble size, because the driver holds one
#: trajectory on the GPU at a time: 15,946 MiB at N=4, 15,888 at N=10,
#: 15,796 at N=20.  The mechanism is in the filter block of those same
#: receipts -- letkf sizes its chunk as budget // per_point and
#: per_point scales with members, so chunk_points halves (6,912 at N=10
#: to 3,444 at N=20) while the chunk's BYTES stay pinned here.
#:
#: 6144 is therefore a MEASURED-TO-FIT value with a thin margin, not a
#: measured-optimal one.  The ladder that would settle a lower default
#: (and the CuPy pool-cap probe beside it, tools/ens_sweep/

    """Which radars every observation of this case is built from.

    One radar measures the wind along its own beam and nothing else, so
    a single-radar analysis is one projection of a three-component
    field.  ``tools/obs_radar_grid_build.py`` has accepted several
    radars per analysis time since the Level-II work; this type is how
    the front door asks for them, and it is the ONE place the request
    is turned into that tool's argv -- the cycle's observations and the
    rolling verifier's observed composites are built from the same
    object, so a case cannot grade itself against a thinner (or
    thicker) analysis than it assimilated.

    ``anchor`` is always the surveyed site: it sites the domain, it
    names the case's files, and it is what a receipt means by
    ``site``.  It is distinct from the radars that CONTRIBUTE, which
    is why both are carried.

    Three shapes, and the default is the old behaviour exactly:

    * neither ``sites`` nor ``discover``  -> ``--site <anchor>``, the
      single-radar argv this function emitted before multi-radar
      existed, byte for byte;
    * ``sites``    -> ``--site`` repeated, anchor first, deduplicated;
    * ``discover`` -> ``--discover-sites``, and the radars are computed
      from the georeference by :mod:`woof.obs.coverage`.  The anchor
      is NOT named in this route -- the obs builder refuses to mix
      naming and discovery, on the grounds that the receipt could not
      then say which route chose which radar, and the anchor sits at
      the domain centre so discovery finds it with the best coverage
