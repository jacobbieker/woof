"""Re-resolve every ``file:line`` anchor the manual and the public pages cite.

THE CONCRETE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS.  A documentation sentence that cites a
line number is making a checkable claim, and line numbers rot the moment
anything above them is edited.  Measured on this tree, 2026-09-17:
``docs/manual/02-dynamics-grids-nesting.md`` cited
``docs/public/CONFIGURATION.md:235`` and ``:414`` for the ``scalar_adv_opt``
matching rule; :235 is the middle of a plain list of other key names and
:414 is a sentence about sealed preparation states, while the rows that
carry the rule are :332 and :627.  Two lines lower it cited :90 for
``spec_bdy_width``, which is the ``## Tweakable knobs`` heading; the row is
:103.  A reader who follows such a citation to check a claim finds
unrelated text and cannot tell whether the claim or the pointer is wrong.

WHY AN ANCHOR AND NOT EXISTENCE.  :235 exists.  So each citation is resolved
against an ANCHOR: the configuration key or code symbol the citing sentence
itself names, in backticks.  The cited line, or any line of a cited range,
must contain one of those names.  A citation that drifts by one line loses
its anchor and is reported here.  This is the rule
``tools/check_registry_citations.py`` applies to the physics registry's own
citations, with the anchor read out of the citing prose instead of recorded
in a table, because prose is where these live and a table would rot beside
the thing it describes.

SCOPE.  ``docs/manual/`` and ``docs/public/``, citing ``CONFIGURATION.md`` or
any ``woof/**.py`` module: the pages a reader is sent to, and the two kinds
of target whose lines a reader would actually open.  A citation into a file
this repository does not carry is reported as unresolvable rather than
guessed at.  A sentence that names no key or symbol is counted as unanchored
and listed without failing, because nothing can check such a citation and
saying how many there are is the useful answer.
