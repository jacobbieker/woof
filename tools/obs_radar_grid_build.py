"""Level-II -> ``gpuwm-obs.radar-grid.v1``, the production spine.

One invocation builds ONE observation file for ONE analysis time on ONE
georeference, which is the 1:1 pairing ``tools/da_cycle_prepared.py``
hard-requires (one obs file + one ``--grid-wrfout`` per leg) made
explicit at build time rather than assembled by hand afterwards:

    fetch -> decode -> verify -> superob -> grid -> receipt

**One analysis time, but not necessarily one radar.**  ``--site`` repeats,
and ``--discover-sites`` finds them from the georeference itself through
:mod:`woof.obs.coverage`, which computes coverage from the front door's
own vendored site table and the grid's own mass points.  No site id is
ever a default here; ids are arguments or they are results, never
constants.

Why it matters: one radar measures the wind component along its own beam
and nothing else, so a single-radar velocity analysis is one projection of
a three-component field.  Two radars whose coverage overlaps measure two
projections of the same wind and constrain what neither can alone.  The
whole stack below this tool has carried a per-radar axis since it was
written -- ``merge_contributions`` takes a sequence, ``vr_obs`` is
``(radar, level, y, x)``, the file carries ``radar_id``/``radar_lat``/
``radar_lon``/``radar_valid_time``, and the DA adapter makes each radar
its own ``vr:<SITE>`` batch with its own localization and thinning.  This
tool was the one place that only ever passed one.

**Volumes from different radars are not synchronous, and the policy is
stated.**  Each site contributes the volume nearest the requested analysis
time within ``--max-offset-seconds``, exactly as the single-radar route
does.  The *spread* between the contributing volumes is then checked
against ``--max-radar-time-spread-seconds``: sites that agree to within a
volume period describe one atmosphere, and sites that do not describe two.
Every contributing volume's own valid time is written per radar into the
file, so the assimilating side is never told a fiction about simultaneity.

**A site that fails to fetch degrades to the ones that did.**  It is
recorded in the receipt with its refusal, counted, and the run continues
so long as ``--min-radars`` are left.  A thinner analysis that does not
say it is thinner is the failure mode this exists to prevent.

Every stage is shipped code: the vendored ``rw_nexrad`` front door via
:mod:`woof.obs.nexrad` (the audit-hardened S3/XML/cache subsystem; the
Message-31 VOL-block antenna resolution is active, so the volume places
its own antenna and the receipt records that source), the superobber via
:mod:`woof.obs.superob`, and the writer via
:mod:`woof.obs.radar_grid` with the grid identity bound to the
georeference wrfout the observations were gridded onto.

Range authority: this tool passes exactly ONE ``--max-range-km`` to BOTH
the decode and the superob parameters (default: the SuperobParams
default), closing the silent 300-vs-250 km disagreement between the two
defaults.  The receipt records the single value used.

Volume selection: the volume whose valid time is nearest the requested
``--valid-time`` wins, and it must land within ``--max-offset-seconds``
(default 480 s) or the tool refuses -- an analysis fed a stale volume
should be a decision, not an accident.

Dual-pol QC: ``--cc-qc`` requests the RHO (correlation coefficient)
plane from the decode and enables the mask in :mod:`woof.obs.cc_qc`,
whose rule is per moment.  In reflectivity low CC alone never drops a
gate, so hail cores, the melting layer and tornadic debris signatures
survive as echo.  In velocity there is no reflectivity shield: a
low-CC gate loses its velocity at every reflectivity, debris core
included, because a scatterer that does not move with the air is not a
wind observation.  The one exemption is the debris-signature fringe --
30 to 35 dBZ, CC above the debris floor, beside a clustered velocity
couplet in the same sweep -- which keeps its velocity because that band
is where a weak or distant tornado's rotation lives.  It is on with
``--cc-qc``; ``--cc-no-tds-fringe-exempt`` restores the strict rule,
and the receipt counts every gate the exemption kept and every
candidate each criterion turned away.

Off by default until the staged A/B proves it, and off is
byte-identical to a build from before the flag existed.  What the mask
did, sweep by sweep and moment by moment, lands in the receipt and the
NetCDF provenance -- per radar, since this tool builds one file from as
many radars as cover the grid.

Feed selection: ``--source auto`` (the default) prefers the real-time
chunk feed and falls back to the archive when the live feed cannot cover
the request; ``--source live`` refuses rather than falling back;
``--source archive`` is the route this tool opened with.  The choice, the
objects it resolved to, and the MEASURED lag between the newest object and
the bucket's own clock all land in the receipt and in the NetCDF
provenance -- see :mod:`woof.obs.radar_source`.

No case names belong here; sites, times and buckets are arguments.
EXPERIMENTAL, like everything it drives.
