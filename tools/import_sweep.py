"""Import every module the wheel ships, and refuse an undeclared absence.

    python -m tools.import_sweep

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS
--------------------------
xc-06-01 of the 2026-09 audit measured what this repository's automated gates
actually execute.  `.github/workflows/` held one file, `publish.yml`, whose
`test` job names 17 test files by hand -- 452 of the tree's 14,711 test
functions, 3.1%.  Resolving every `woof.*` import in those 17 files reaches
51 of 525 package modules directly; the module-scope transitive closure
reaches 221 modules, 209,243 lines, 48.3% of the package.  The other half --
`woof/da/`, most of `woof/core/`, the whole verify tree -- was not IMPORTED
by anything CI ran.  A SyntaxError, a bad module-scope constant or a broken
internal import there produced a green check on the pull request.

This sweep is the cheapest complete answer to that half of the finding.  It
imports every module of the packages the wheel ships, in seconds, with no GPU,
no fixtures and no network, and it fails on anything that is not a DECLARED
optional dependency.  It checks module initialization; it does not execute every function body.

WHAT COUNTS AS A PASS
---------------------
A module that imports.  A module that raises `ModuleNotFoundError` naming one
of `OPTIONAL_MODULES` is tolerated and REPORTED BY NAME, because those are the
extras a CPU runner deliberately does not install.

Everything else fails, including `ModuleNotFoundError` for a `woof.*` or
`tilestream.*` name: that is a broken internal import, not a missing extra,
and the distinction is the reason this tool does not simply swallow
`ImportError` the way an opportunistic walk would.  Measured at a70ade37 on a
CPU box with the base dependencies installed: 524 `woof` modules and 131
`tilestream` modules walked, 0 failures, and the only absent names were
`cupy` (29 modules once the five programs below are set aside) and `netCDF4`
-- and netCDF4 is a BASE dependency, so on a runner that ran
`pip install -e .` cupy is the only legitimate absence.

A module that calls `sys.exit()` at import scope is a FAILURE, named like any
other.  It used to be the end of the sweep: the walk caught `Exception`, and
`SystemExit` is not one, so the whole gate exited with that module's status
and printed no report at all.  On a box with a visible CUDA device that is
what `python -m tools.import_sweep` did -- exit 2, no verdict -- because
`tilestream/attack_real12gb.py` refuses at import scope when the card is not
idle.  A gate a module can terminate says nothing about the modules after it.

WHY NOT `tools`, AND WHY NOT THE FIVE PROGRAMS UNDER `tilestream`
-----------------------------------------------------------------
`tools/` ships, but several of its top-level modules print a report at import
(`tools/perf_survey.py` and neighbours write their tables to stdout) and some
open files beside them.  Importing them is a side effect, not a check, so the
sweep covers the two packages whose modules are libraries.

`tilestream/` carries five modules of the same shape -- the four `attack_*`
one-off structural attacks and `digest_dump`, whose module bodies ARE the
program: they read the device, spawn `tilestream.vram_probe` subprocesses,
print their tables and, in `digest_dump`'s case, open `sys.argv[1]`.  They are
named in `SCRIPT_MODULES`, walked, reported, and not imported.
