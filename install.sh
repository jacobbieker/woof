#!/bin/sh
# One-command install for a WOOF developer checkout (POSIX sh).
#
#   ./install.sh [--yes] [--no-render] [--cuda 12|13]
#                                           -- from a checkout root
#
# The standalone (curl | sh) form clones the public repository into
# ./gpuwm when run outside a checkout; WOOF_REPO_URL overrides the
# clone source (fork or mirror).
#
# What it does, in order (every step is re-run safe):
#   1. finds the checkout (or clones $WOOF_REPO_URL into ./woof);
#   2. creates .venv if absent, installs the checkout's recast-woof-data
#      companion, then installs -e '.[gpu-cuNN,render]' into it,
#      where NN is the CUDA major this box's driver reports (CuPy
#      ships one wheel per major and the wrong one dies at its first
#      cuBLAS load); --cuda overrides the detection, and an
#      undetectable major is announced rather than defaulted quietly;
#   3. stages the externalized Thompson tables with `woof fetch-tables`
#      (downloads only what is absent -- ~243 MiB from a checkout --
#      SHA-256 verified before install; a no-op when already staged;
#      skip with --no-fetch-tables or WOOF_INSTALL_NO_FETCH_TABLES=1);
#   4. offers to install rustup when `cargo` is missing (prompts first;
#      --yes or WOOF_INSTALL_YES=1 consents non-interactively);
#   5. builds the vendored Rust GRIB bridges offline in
#      tools/grib1_bridge;
#   6. builds the vendored production render engine offline in
#      tools/rustwx (skip with --no-render or
#      WOOF_INSTALL_NO_RENDER=1);
#   7. (the terminal workspace is not part of this engine);
#   8. builds the regular-grid Zarr reader offline in tools/zarr_bridge,
#      the mapped-source decode engine in tools/rw_wps and the velocity
#      dealiasing library in tools/region_global_dealias (the default
#      decode path and the default dealiasing engine);
#   9. finishes with `woof doctor`, with .venv/bin on its PATH, and
#      exits with doctor's status.
#
# Environment:
#   WOOF_REPO_URL     clone source when run outside a checkout
#                      (default:
#                      https://github.com/recastsystems/woof).
#   WOOF_PYTHON       interpreter used to create .venv (default:
#                      python3, then python)
#   WOOF_INSTALL_YES  "1" behaves like --yes
#   WOOF_INSTALL_NO_RENDER  "1" behaves like --no-render
#   WOOF_INSTALL_NO_FETCH_TABLES  "1" behaves like --no-fetch-tables
#   WOOF_INSTALL_CUDA  "12" or "13" behaves like --cuda
