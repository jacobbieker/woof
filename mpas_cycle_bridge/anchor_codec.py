"""The anchor's on-disk encoding, with no woof in it.

``woof.cycle.anchor`` owns the anchor's *policy*: which fields are
required, what a legal parent kind is, the three-phase commit, the
refusals.  This module owns its *encoding*: how an array mapping becomes
bytes, how those bytes hash, and how they come back.

The split exists so the forecast worker -- which may not import woof at
all (see :mod:`mpas_cycle_bridge.spine_guard`) -- can still read an
anchor and write a segment in exactly the same format, from exactly the
same code, rather than from a parallel reimplementation that drifts.  A
reader tested against its own writer proves nothing; both sides here run
these functions.

``woof.cycle.anchor`` imports from this module.  Nothing here imports
from it.
