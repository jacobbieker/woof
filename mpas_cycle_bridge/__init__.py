"""The bridge between the cycling spine and the MPAS GPU port.

This package exists because of a hard structural fact, not a preference.
The port pins woof by commit and loads it from a frozen Arwen checkout,
and it refuses to do so if ``woof`` is already live from another tree::

    woof was already imported from a different tree; exact frozen
    Arwen v2 Arwen cannot replace a live package

``woof.cycle`` -- the cycling spine -- IS woof.  So a spine that
imports the port into its own process has already claimed the package
name and the port refuses by law.  The two ways out were to rotate the
port's woof pin, or to put a process boundary between the spine and the
forecast.  Rotating the pin would re-base every MPAS receipt that cites
it and would couple cycle development to a frozen commit forever.  The
process boundary costs orchestration and nothing else -- and the port's
own restart proof (15+15 steps across a fresh process, bitwise identical
to 30 continuous) is exactly the evidence that a process boundary here
is lossless.

So: **nothing in this package may import woof.**  Everything the
forecast worker needs lives here, gpuwm-free, and the spine imports
*from* this package rather than the other way round.  The dependency
arrow points away from woof, which is what makes the constraint
structural instead of a comment somebody will one day not read.

The worker enforces it at runtime as well -- see
:mod:`mpas_cycle_bridge.spine_guard`.
