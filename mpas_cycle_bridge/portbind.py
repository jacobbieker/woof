"""The port-facing half of the seam, with no woof in it.

This is the code that loads the MPAS GPU port by path, verifies every
symbol it will call, maps an anchor's array mappings onto the port's
state objects, and takes a boundary off the device.  It lives in the
bridge rather than in woof.cycle for one reason: the forecast
worker runs in a process where importing woof is forbidden until the
port itself pins its frozen Arwen checkout, so anything the worker calls
must be reachable without the woof name.

woof.cycle.mpas_port_adapter re-exports everything here and adds
the spine-side refusal type.  There is one implementation; both sides
run it.
