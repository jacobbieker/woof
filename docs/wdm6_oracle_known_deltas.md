# WDM6 (mp_physics=16): known deltas before the oracle campaign

Read this before quoting any ULP or relative-agreement number for mp=16.

**Status of the scheme:** implemented-unverified. No oracle comparison against
`phys/module_mp_wdm6.F` has been run. This file is not evidence that one was;
it is the list of places where a comparison is expected to disagree, or was
suspected to and does not, written down before the campaign so nobody spends a
night rediscovering them.

The physics registry's `wdm6-mp16` warnings cite this file.

## 1. `_rgmma` runs in float64 where the Fortran runs in REAL(4) -- REAL, unbounded a priori

`woof/core/wsm6_constants.py::_rgmma` is WRF's own truncated Weierstrass
product, ported verbatim, and WDM6's coefficient block reuses it
(`woof/core/wdm6_constants.py`). Getting the *truncation* right is the thing
that matters and the port has it: `wdm6init`'s inline comment at
`module_mp_wdm6.F:2130` claims `g4pbr = 17.837825` (the true `Gamma(4.8)`),
while the code's own 10000-term product returns 17.8173. Porting to the comment
would have been a 0.1-0.7% error in every fall speed. The port reproduces the
code.

What is NOT reproduced is the arithmetic width. The Fortran accumulates the
product in default `REAL` (single precision); woof accumulates in Python
float64 and only then rounds to FP32. With 10^4 sequential multiply-accumulates
the accumulated single-precision rounding can reach the 5th-6th significant
digit, so every derived coefficient can differ in its last FP32 digits -- and
these coefficients multiply *every* fall speed and collection rate.

Consequence for the campaign: a per-column ULP comparison against a
`gfortran -O0` oracle will show a nonzero floor that is NOT a transcription
error. Establish that floor first, by driving the oracle's own `wdm6init` and
diffing its coefficients against `woof/core/wdm6_constants.py`, before
attributing any process-rate difference to the process.

This is inherited from WSM6, which shares `_rgmma`. It is deliberate: float64 is
the defensible arithmetic, and WOOF's standing rule is not to be bit-exact to a
rounding artifact.

## 2. The PLM remap's `kt` clamp -- REAL divergence, believed unreachable

`woof/core/kernels/wdm6.cu` clamps the remap top index (`kt = (kt > 0) ? kt - 1
: 0`) where `nislfv_rain_plmr:2629` and `nislfv_rain_plm6:2891` decrement
unconditionally. On the one input where they differ, the Fortran drops a
layer's mass and the port conserves it. The port takes the defined behaviour, as
the standing rule requires.

Believed unreachable for `nz >= 2`, because the `con1 = 0.05` limiter forces
`dza >= 0.95*dz`, and `nz = 1` is below the adapter's floor of 2. "Believed" is
an argument, not a measurement. If a column oracle ever shows a single-layer
mass difference in sedimentation with everything else matching, this is it. The
full reasoning is in a comment at the site.

## 3. The rain-slope density inconsistency -- REAL, and it is WRF's

`wdm62D` consumes `ncr` as a VOLUMETRIC number (`:2251`) while `refl10cm_wdm6`
forms `nr = nr1d*rho` against `rr = qr1d*rho`, so the densities cancel and
`nr1d` enters as a PER-MASS number (`:3005`). The two rain slope definitions
differ by a factor `rho` inside a cube root, about 3% in `lamr` near the
surface. WRF does this; woof reproduces both as written. An oracle will
therefore agree -- this is listed so nobody "fixes" it into a disagreement.

## 4. The -35 dBZ floor is NOT a delta -- checked, and the suspicion is wrong

Recorded because it looks like one on a partial read, and a reviewer raised it.

`refl10cm_wdm6` initialises `dBZ(k) = -35.0` and then, in its final loop
(`:3126-3128`), overwrites every level unconditionally with
`10.*log10((ze_rain+ze_snow+ze_graupel)*1.d18)`. With the `1.e-22` floor on each
of the three `ze` accumulators, a hydrometeor-free column leaves the routine at
`10*log10(3e-22*1e18) = -35.23` dBZ, not -35.0. So the ROUTINE's floor really is
-35.23.

But the routine is not the boundary. The caller stores
`refl_10cm(i,k,j) = max(-35., dBZ(k))` (`:294`), and woof applies exactly that
clamp inside its kernel (`fmaxf(-35.0f, ...)`). The published field is identical
on both sides, including in hydrometeor-free columns. There is no 0.23 dB
inheritance.

Compare against `refl_10cm`, the field WRF publishes -- not against `dBZ`, the
routine's intermediate -- and this reads as agreement.

## 5. Conservative rain interfaces replace an inherited loss

The rain update in unmodified WRF v4.6.1 `module_mp_wdm6.F:810-839`
caps an arrival by the upstream cell's remaining state after that cell
has already lost its outgoing flux. The earlier CUDA transcription did
the same. It is not a translation error: both versions can discard the
difference between the amount removed and the smaller amount received.

The corrected `wdm6_rain_substep` transfers a single amount across each
interface. Its mass inventory is `rho * dz * qr` in kg/m2 and its number
inventory is `dz * nr` in 1/m2. An outgoing flux is limited by that donor's
inventory once; exactly that amount enters the next cell or the recorded
surface fallout. Incoming flux is never capped by the donor's remaining
state. The column sums therefore telescope, including unequal layer
depths and densities. There is no state clipping or column renormalization.
The existing separate mass and number fall speeds and their substep
refresh remain unchanged.

A retained 40-level, 2km warm column with a 1g/kg rain slab activates the
defect through production physics at 25, 60 and 120 second physics steps;
the existing mixed-phase fixture does not. The production regression is
`tests/test_wdm6_column.py::test_warm_rain_conserves_water_through_production_microphysics`.
`tests/test_wdm6_sedimentation.py` compiles the same substep for independent
mass/number budgets, true surface-flux controls and unequal density/depth.
Full microphysics has physical number sources and sinks, so number
conservation is asserted for sedimentation, not for the entire scheme.

This changes the numerical trajectory deliberately. The checkpoint
algorithm identity advances to v3 so an older checkpoint cannot silently
continue under the changed rain update. A WRF comparison should report
this conservation difference rather than reinstate the defective arrival
cap to obtain agreement. No other microphysics scheme is changed.

### The substep schedule covers newly wet receiving layers

A count derived from initial rain speeds does not bound refreshed speeds.
In a two-layer column with depths 1m and 100m and an initially dry lower
layer, it permits a later terminal Courant number above 100 while donor
limiting still conserves water. The arrival profile then depends strongly
on the outer interval. Conservation alone does not establish time accuracy.

The inverse rain slope is bounded by the existing 1e-3m PSD cap. Therefore
`2998.49272 * (1e-3)**0.8 * sqrt(1.28/rho)` bounds the mass fall speed for
every layer, including a dry receiver. The number speed is smaller by
the existing coefficient ratio 0.47053124. The new count uses this bound
and layer depth, so its terminal Courant stays below 0.4 throughout the
interval. It retains the existing slope refresh and conservative transfer.

For the active smooth PSD branch, write `p=0.8/3` and `b=0.47053124`.
The mass/number flux Jacobian divided by the mass speed has trace
`1+p+b*(1-p)` and determinant `b`; its larger eigenvalue is about 1.228805.
The 1.25 speed multiplier and 0.5 wave Courant give the 0.4 terminal bound.
The capped branch has constant speed. The inherited small-moment branch
switches remain unchanged; this calculation is not a smoothness claim
across those thresholds. The general wave-speed basis is described in the
[Clawpack time-step documentation](https://www.clawpack.org/dev/setrun.html).

The schedule stays first order in time. Tests separately check evolving
Courants, final profiles against a refined simultaneous flux calculation,
and convergence of the first arrival under actual interval refinement.
They cover both initially wet and dry unequal layers. The geometric
speed envelope also bounds the first dry-receiver step, where a budget
based only on current wet-cell rates can be coarse. It is not a universal
seconds cap, a state clip, a forecast-skill result or a complete WRF oracle.
The v3 checkpoint identity distinguishes this schedule from the interim
v2 conservative transfer with initial-speed substeps.

## What an oracle campaign for this scheme still has to build

A `tools/wdm6_wrf461_oracle` harness driving the byte-frozen Fortran at
`gfortran -O0` over a column fixture set, on the Shin-Hong / Grell-Freitas
pattern. Both `hail_opt` arms, and both `xland` arms -- WDM6 is the first woof
microphysics whose PROCESS RATES read a surface field
(`module_mp_wdm6.F:607-614`), so a land/sea mask that differs between the two
sides is a trajectory difference with no other symptom.
