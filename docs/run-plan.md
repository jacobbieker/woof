# `woof run-plan`: driving woof from a program

Every other front door in woof talks to a person. `woof run-plan`
talks to a program: one versioned JSON plan in, one append-only JSONL
event stream out. A GUI, a scheduler or a fleet controller drives it as
a subprocess and never parses a line of human output.

Nothing about the model changes. The plan is an **envelope** over the
config system: it resolves through the same loader `woof run` uses and
executes through the same `runtime.run_experiment`. There is no second
config format.

```
woof run-plan PLAN.json          # run it, stream events
python -m woof.runplan PLAN.json # the same command, same flags

woof run-plan --resolve  PLAN.json   # what will run, and every value nobody typed
woof run-plan --estimate PLAN.json   # what it will cost
woof run-plan --probe                # what this machine can do
```

Exit codes: **0** when the last event was `completed`, **1** when it was
`failed`, **2** on a refused plan (nothing started), **130** on Ctrl-C.

## The plan document: `gpuwm.run-plan.v1`

```json
{
  "schema": "gpuwm.run-plan.v1",
  "name": "overnight-run",
  "route": "experiment",
  "config": { "path": "conus3km.toml" },
  "output_root": "runs/overnight",
  "fetch":  { "args": ["--source", "gfs", "--cycle", "2026080700", "--hours", "12", "--out", "data"] },
  "run_options": { "device": 0, "dry_run": false, "restart": null, "health_debug": false }
}
```

| key | required | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `schema` | yes | must be exactly `gpuwm.run-plan.v1` |
| `name` | yes | this run's label; carried on every event |
| `route` | yes | which existing front door executes it (see below) |
| `config` | yes | exactly one of `{"path": ...}`, `{"inline": "<TOML text>"}` or `{"intent": {...}}` |
| `output_root` | no | **the run directory itself**, not a parent. Default `out/run`, woof run's own |
| `fetch` | no | `{"args": [...]}`, the argv list `woof fetch` itself takes |
| `run_options` | no | the subset the route declares |

Relative paths resolve against **the plan file's own directory**, so a
plan and its config travel together.

Unknown top-level keys, unknown `run_options`, an unknown `route` and an
unknown `schema` are all **refused**, never ignored: a dropped key runs
a default under the name of your value.

`fetch.args` is validated by building woof's **real** fetch parser and
handing it the list. There is no second copy of the fetch flag table
here, so a flag added to `woof fetch` is accepted here on the same
commit, and a typo is refused before the run claims a directory.

### `config.intent`: submitting a shape instead of a config

A front end that collects "here, this big, this long, from this source"
has intent, not a config. `config.intent` hands that intent to the
`woof domain` wizard, which writes the complete TOML: the same wizard,
the same refusals, the same emitted bytes a person gets from the CLI.

```json
"config": { "intent": {
  "point": "35.2,-97.4",
  "ladder": "12-3",
  "source": "era5",
  "cycle": "latest",
  "hours": 12,
  "vram_gib": 24
}}
```

Every intent key is a `woof domain` flag, one to one. Nothing here is a
second config format, and no value is validated twice: the wizard's own
parser is what accepts or refuses each one.

| intent key | flag | intent key | flag |
|---|---|---|---|
| `point` | `--point LAT,LON` | `hours` | `--hours` |
| `polygon` | `--polygon` | `source` | `--source` |
| `buffer_km` | `--buffer-km` | `cycle` | `--cycle` |
| `projection` | `--projection` | `forecast_start_hour` | `--forecast-start-hour` |
| `name` | `--name` | `data_dir` | `--data-dir` |
| `card` | `--card` | `forcing` | `--forcing` |
| `vram_gib` | `--vram-gib` | `vtable` | `--vtable` |
| `ladder` | `--ladder` | `geog_root` | `--geog-root` |
| `root_dx_km` | `--root-dx` | `chain` | `--chain` |
| `physics_profile` | `--physics-profile` | `physics_choices` | `--physics-choices` |

`physics_choices` is an object, family to scheme (`{"microphysics":
"thompson-mp8", "pbl": "myj", "surface_layer": "eta-similarity"}`),
and reaches the wizard as the JSON its flag takes. The wizard checks it
the way `woof physics-catalog --check` does and writes it over the
suite (`physics_profile`, or the default at the finest grid, the one
the check names for the same grid) the way
`woof physics-catalog --into` writes a mix, on every size its fit
tries, so the card is priced for the schemes that run. The suite is then
the base, not an assertion: the chain's stages are not told the config
is that suite, and a plan that also sets `run_options.physics_profile`
is refused, because the preparer would refuse the config it makes. The
run manifest's `physics` records `choices`, `base_suite`, the
`components` they resolve to and the suite they make, or null. The
HRRR route runs its namelists, which have no key for `moist_cq`, so a
mix from HRRR is written with the value that route's importer runs:
the suite's own when the mix is a shipped suite, and `false` otherwise.

A `physics_profile` with no `physics_choices` is the suite the wizard
writes. The chain's stages are told the config is that suite only where
the written file is that suite on every domain, the conflict check
`woof go` derives its `--physics-profile` with. With nests it usually
is not: the wizard turns cumulus off on nests below the gray zone and
steps their sixth-order damping down the ladder, so a tree whose suite
has cumulus, or damps harder than the nests' ladder, runs its file as
written, the suite on the root; a cumulus-free suite that the ladder
leaves unchanged is still asserted. A suite named in
`run_options.physics_profile` is always asserted.

`point` or `polygon` is required (there is no default place), and so is
`cycle`. `--out` is deliberately **not** exposed: run-plan owns where the
generated config lands, so a plan cannot write outside its run directory.

The generated TOML is carried **verbatim** on the `resolved_plan` event
and in `--resolve`, as `generated_config`. The caller never typed it, so
it is the one thing they cannot look up: show it.

**There is no `nx`/`ny`.** Domain size is *fitted* by the wizard's VRAM
estimator from the ladder and the card budget; it is an output, not an
input. Each fitted size is reported in `automatic_resolutions` with
`basis: "fitted_to_vram_budget"`.

**Output cadence is a first-class control.** `history_interval_s` sets
the root domain's write interval and `nest_history_interval_s` every
nest's; they default to 3600 s and 900 s. Both map to new `woof domain`
flags (`--history-interval`, `--nest-history-interval`).

The engine's rule is that a cadence must be a whole number of seconds
**and** a whole number of *that domain's* time steps, judged against the
exact rational `dt`, so a nest's cadence must divide the nest's step,
not the root's. The wizard round-trips its emitted bytes through the
real loader before writing, so a bad value is refused with the loader's
own sentence and no file lands.

#### Which sources an intent drives is derived, not listed

Whether an intent can drive a source is **derived from its registry
row**, never from a list of model names kept in run-plan
(`woof.runplan.intent_drivability`): the row must be runnable, declare
a forcing cadence (so `woof domain` can emit its `namelist.wps`), have
an acquisition route, and sit on an implementation route one of this
door's chains executes. A row added to the registry with those facts is
intent-drivable with zero code change here. An intent naming a source
that fails a fact is refused up front **with that fact** (a missing
acquisition route, a missing cadence, no runnable implementation
route, a member selection the route's own grammar cannot bind),
never with "unknown source".

A member set is no longer one of those facts. An ensemble row
resolves its default or config-selected member through its
acquisition route's grammar, and the staged chain verifies the member
identity of the messages that arrive before preparation consumes
them, so an intent naming an ensemble source drives it.

`woof domain` writes a `[case_data]` table (the declared inputs a
config-driven run needs) only for the combined-GRIB1 decode family
(`era5` today), so those sources run on the `experiment` route and
every other drivable source runs on `prepared`. An intent naming a
source on the wrong route is refused naming the right one.

### Routes

| route | what it is | source |
|---|---|---|
| `experiment` | the config-driven route: one experiment TOML with its `[case_data]` inputs, prepared and integrated in this process, what `woof run CONFIG` executes | era5 |
| `prepared` | the native prepared-cache chain, in the documented order | **gfs**, **hrrr**, or any packaged mapped source with a table fetch route (icon-eu, rap, rrfs, hrrr-prs, gem-gdps, aifs, aigfs, ecmwf-open-data, the registry's facts decide, not this list) |

ERA5 through the public ARCO store is keyless; an ERA5 intent naming no
provider already uses it. Only the Copernicus CDS provider and ERA5 ensemble
members need a Copernicus key. The `prepared` + `gfs` path is also public and
runs end to end on a machine with no credentials at all.

The route reads the config's own `[fetch].source` and drives that
source's documented chain. Neither chain is re-implemented here.

**gfs** runs `woof go`: the documented chain, and the only thing that
relays the integrity digests between stages without a person carrying
them. run-plan builds the same argparse namespace the `go` subcommand
builds and hands `go_main` an observer, with trees allowed: a
multi-domain config keeps the same preparation stages and dispatches
the forecast to `woof-prepared-tree-forecast`, binding the sha256 of
the hierarchy document rw-wps left in the prepared root. `go`'s other
refusals (an ERA5 `[case_data]` config, another source) surface
verbatim as a `failed` event, and the interactive `woof go` command
keeps its own tree refusal.

**A packaged mapped source** (icon-eu, rap, rrfs, hrrr-prs, …) runs the
**staged chain**: `woof fetch` (its table acquisition route) →
`woof prep` (rw-wps's declarative mapped arm, the packaged profile
already bound) → the prepared forecast runner, in process. The
preparation's arguments are relayed from the fetch route's own
published handoff (`prep-arguments.json`: the ordered `--input-list`,
every `--supplement` role binding, the manifest authoring flag); the
chain appends explicit `run_options.supplement` bindings and the four values the handoff declares are the
caller's, `--wps-namelist` (the wizard's emission beside the config),
`--experiment-config`, `--geog-root` and `--output-root`. The forecast
is bound off the bundle exactly as `woof sim` binds it
(`stage_cli.resolve_bundle` + `sim_command`), then rendered by `go`'s
render stage. Which source lands on this chain is the registry row's
answer (`runner = "mapped_composition_v1"`, a composed packaged
profile, a table fetch route, no member set), never a name list.

**hrrr** runs its own chain, because `go` refuses the source by
construction (`ORCHESTRATED_SOURCES = ("gfs",)`): fetch →
`tools.prepare_hrrr_wrf` → `prepared_single_domain_forecast`. The
stages and their order are the wizard's own printed chain
(`domain_wizard.hrrr_route_commands`), driven rather than printed, with
every stage's refusals left alone. It reuses `go`'s stage primitive, so
capture, heartbeats and failure replay are identical on both chains.

One thing is *added* to the HRRR chain: **`--wps-namelist`**. The
runner's HRRR manifest requires a `wps_namelist` role (the prepared
cache identity's `namelist_sha256` **is** that file's digest on this
route), and the preparer only publishes the portable bundle (`proof.json`,
the role-keyed source manifest, the experiment authority) when handed
that flag. The printed chain never passed it, so the bundle it produced
could not be read by the single-domain runner at all and HRRR was sent
to a benchmark script instead. Passing it makes a single-domain HRRR
bundle structurally identical to a GFS one at the run step: same runner,
same digests, same in-process observer.

The forecast stage's inputs come from the preparer's published
`portable_bundle` handoff (in `public-wrapper-result.json`), not from
re-derivation. Three of them are not guessable: `proof.json` lives at
the **output root**, not inside the prepared cache; `--prepared-root` is
that same root; and `--experiment-config` / `--wps-namelist` must be the
**published copies** (`experiment.toml`, `namelist.wps`), because the
runner checks each supplied file's name and digest against the portable
manifest. The relayed digests are cross-checked against `proof.json` on
disk before the forecast starts.

Multi-domain HRRR runs too, on a four-stage chain: the fetch, the root
preparation, `woof.hrrr_hierarchy_direct` to build `d02..dNN` from the
sealed root, and then the same `woof-prepared-tree-forecast` the GFS
tree uses. Multi-domain GFS runs, as above. A nested HRRR tree can also
*move* a nest: the hierarchy stage seals the statics corridor, see
moving nests, above.

`physics_profile` is passed to the HRRR preparer only when the plan
states it (as an intent key or a run option). The route owns its own
physics gate, the emitted TOML records physics as numbers rather than a
profile id, and a default invented at this layer would silently outrank
the preparer's own.

`prepared` additionally takes the `data_dir` run option (where the
fetch lands). The `experiment` route does not: it declares its inputs
in `[case_data]` instead.

Routes are named generically. A route is a way of running the model,
never a particular experiment.

#### Moving nests (`[relocation]`) by route

A moving nest is a config with a `[relocation]` follow source:
`[relocation.follow]` or `[[relocation.move]]`. Enabled `[relocation]`
with neither is a *bounds-only* nest: it constrains where the nest may
sit, the nest does not move, and none of this section applies to it.

**Nothing to add to the plan document.** A moving nest is declared in
the config, and every door reads it from there
(`woof.static.corridor.config_declares_follow_source`: one predicate,
shared by `woof go`, the printed `rw-wps` line and run-plan, so they
cannot disagree). There is no `run_options` key for it: a caller that
could ask for a moving nest and separately forget the statics it moves
onto would be a caller that can prepare a bundle its own forecast stage
refuses.

| chain | how a moving nest gets its statics |
|---|---|
| `experiment` | the route holds the geography source for the whole run and rebuilds each footprint at move time. Nothing prepared, nothing priced. |
| `prepared` + gfs | the preparation seals a **statics corridor** and the tree runner crops it. Run-plan composes `--statics-corridor` on the rw-wps prepare stage. |
| `prepared` + hrrr | the same corridor, sealed by the **hierarchy stage**. Run-plan composes `--statics-corridor` on `woof.hrrr_hierarchy_direct`. |
| `prepared` + a packaged mapped source | the same corridor, sealed by mapped hierarchy preparation. Run-plan composes `--statics-corridor` on `woof prep`, which forwards it to `woof.mapped_direct`. Every source using this preparation contract inherits the capability. |

The preparation dispatcher (`woof.source_cli.preparation_runners`) owns each
implementation's hierarchy schema and corridor stage. Run planning and the
cyclone menu derive moving-statics support from those existing implementation
rows; they keep no separate source eligibility list. Other workflows can query
`source_preparation_outputs` without importing either workflow. A new source
using an existing mapping and preparation implementation inherits its outputs.

These declarations describe available machinery. Actual admission still binds
the source state, forcing window, geographic coverage and prepared artifacts
through the ordinary readers. A missing hierarchy or corridor writer is an
implementation gap; a missing or invalid corridor in a particular bundle is an
input requirement. Reuse includes the corridor flag in its argument binding,
so a previous stationary preparation is retained and rebuilt for a moving run.

On every corridor-sealing prepared chain the preparation seals child-resolution
statics over the ground each child can reach during the run (its declared
footprint widened by what its follow settings, itinerary and
`reach_speed_m_s` let it and every moving ancestor travel, clipped to its
frame; see docs/prepared-followers.md) beside the other
hierarchy artifacts, digest-bound into the preparation document, and the
tree runner (`woof-prepared-tree-forecast`) crops each new footprint's
statics out of that corridor at move time: the run stays fully sealed,
no runtime ingest. A bundle prepared *without* a
corridor refuses a follow config at the tree runner's preflight with
the flag named as the remedy, and a corridor that fails digest or
geometry verification refuses loudly rather than running the nest
silently static.

**Which stage carries the flag differs, and that is the only
difference.** On GFS the whole hierarchy is prepared inside rw-wps, so
the corridor rides `woof.source_cli` (`woof go` derives it from the
config, and run-plan drives `go`). HRRR prepares its root first and
builds `d02..dNN` in a separate stage, and only *that* stage knows the
children exist or holds `--geog-root`: its root preparer would refuse
the flag. So the HRRR corridor is sealed by
`woof.hrrr_hierarchy_direct --statics-corridor`, into
`hierarchy-artifacts/statics-corridor/` and bound into `receipt.json`,
which is the same relative path and the same digest discipline the GFS
bundle uses in `proof.json`. The tree runner reads whichever document
matched its pinned digest and cannot tell the two apart.

All of it is derived from one predicate
(`woof.static.corridor.config_declares_follow_source`) and emitted by
one function (`woof.static.corridor.emit_statics_corridor_set`), so
neither chain can drift into a second corridor format or a second
reading of what "a moving nest" means.

**`--resolve` says so before anything runs.** The decision is a record
of its own plus an `automatic_resolutions` entry:

```json
"moving_nest": {"chain":"prepared:go","delivery":"statics_corridor",
                "relocation_grid_id":2,"statics_corridor":true}
```
```json
{"scope":"preparation","key":"statics_corridor","value":true,
 "basis":"relocation_follow","note":"the config declares a [relocation] follow source on d02, so the prepare stage is composed with --statics-corridor …"}
```

`moving_nest` is `null` for a config that moves no nest, and that plan
resolves and prepares exactly as it did before this existed.

**`--estimate` prices it.** The corridor is the largest single thing
the preparation writes for a moving nest, and it is not inferable from
the domain sizes a caller already has: it is *the ground the nest can
reach, at child resolution*, the declared footprint widened by what the
follow settings, itinerary and `reach_speed_m_s` let it and every moving
ancestor travel over the run, clipped to its frame. A 6 h tree with a
9 km 301×335 root, a 3 km nest at (94, 30) that moves up to 8 parent
cells every 30 minutes, and a 1 km and a 500 m nest riding inside it,
prices its 500 m corridor at 3846×2694 cells of the 5418×6030 frame:

```json
"corridor": {
  "domains": [{"domain":"d04","grid_id":4,"parent_id":3,"frame_grid_id":1,
               "corridor_nx":3846,"corridor_ny":2694,"cells":10361124,
               "planes_per_cell":97,"bytes_per_cell":776,
               "host_bytes":8040232224,
               "window_child_cells":[750,750,3846,2694],
               "frame_child_cells":[5418,6030],"whole_frame":false}, …],
  "host_bytes": …, "host_gib": …, "basis": "…"
}
```

`whole_frame` is true when the reach covers the frame, as it does over a
long run. `unbounded` says why when nothing bounds the reach at all: a
dormant nest, whose start is chosen when it fires.

Every child is priced, not only the one that relocates: run-plan passes
the flag bare, which the preparation reads as "every child domain".
Disk and host are the same figure to within container headers: the
cache is an uncompressed NPZ of exactly those arrays, loaded whole by
the runner's preflight. It adds **no GPU residency**, so the `vram`
block is identical with and without a corridor and the VRAM gate is
unchanged. `host_bytes` is `0` with an empty `domains` list when no
nest moves.

**A chain that could not feed a moving nest would refuse at resolve
time, not minutes in.** Every chain this front door dispatches to can
feed one today, so nothing reachable takes that path, but the
machinery stays, because the alternative is a plan that fetches,
prepares a root and builds a hierarchy before the forecast preflight
rejects it. A chain added without an answer to "and where does a moving
nest get its statics on it?" fails the delivery table's completeness
test rather than falling through to whatever the chain happened to do.

### `run_options`

| option | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `device` | `null` | GPU index or full `GPU-…` UUID; sets `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` before anything can create a context |
| `dry_run` | `false` | resolve and validate, emit `resolved_plan`, stop before any device work |
| `restart` | `null` | a `gpuwmrst` checkpoint to continue from |
| `render_products` | `null` | which products the render stage draws: `woof render --products`' own spec (a comma-separated list, or `all`), or `none` to skip rendering. Absent leaves the default set unchanged. `prepared` route only |
| `render_section` | `null` | the line every `xsec:` term of `render_products` is cut along, `woof render --section`'s own value (`lat,lon,lat,lon`, or a JSON file resolved relative to the plan); carried to every render the run draws. An `xsec:` term with no line, or a line the renderer cannot read, is refused when the plan is built |
| `geog_root` | `null` | static geography tree (`prepared` route only) |
| `supplement` | `[]` | repeatable `ROLE=PATH` preparation donor bindings, resolved relative to the plan. HRRR accepts `PMSL=GRIB` inside `data_dir` and binds explicit donor hashes in a run-local source manifest. Mapped routes forward the bindings to their preparer. GFS and existing prepared bundles reject this option. |
| `data_dir` | `null` | where the fetch lands (`prepared` route only) |
| `transport` | `null` | the one host the fetch stage pins, the value `woof fetch --transport` takes; wins over the config's `[fetch] transport`, and `automatic_resolutions` records which one was used (`prepared` route only) |
| `physics_profile` | `null` | passed to the HRRR preparer when stated (`prepared` route only) |
| `health_debug` | `false` | enable debug phase health attribution |

`run-plan` integrates in **this** process rather than re-executing under
woof's own supervisor, so the pid in the manifest is the pid doing the
model work and the caller owns restart policy. That choice is reported
in `automatic_resolutions` on every run, never assumed.

---

## The event stream: `gpuwm.run-plan.event.v1`

One JSON object per line, appended to `<run_dir>/events.jsonl` **and**
mirrored verbatim to stdout. Every line carries the same four envelope
keys, with the event's own fields flattened alongside:

```json
{"schema_version":"gpuwm.run-plan.event.v1","sequence":7,"emitted_unix_ms":1786087223348,"event":"model_progress","domain":1,"outer_step":3,"model_seconds":180.0,"wall_seconds":4.21,"speed_x":42.75,"step_ms":1403.2,"phase":"post-d01-sync"}
```

`sequence` is monotonic **and dense**, starting at 1. A gap means a lost
or reordered line, never a skipped one, and the reader refuses it.

| `event` | fields | when |
|---|---|---|
| `plan_accepted` | `name`, `route`, `plan_source`, `plan_sha256`, `run_dir`, `manifest_path`, `events_path`, `pid`, `run_id` | first line, always |
| `resolved_plan` | `configuration`, `automatic_resolutions`, `config_sha256`, `config_source`, `run_options` | after the config loads, before any device work |
| `stage_started` | `stage`, `phase` | a stage opens |
| `stage_finished` | `stage`, `wall_seconds`, `phases`, (`receipts`, `outcome`) | that stage closes |
| `model_progress` | `domain`, `outer_step`, `model_seconds`, `wall_seconds`, `speed_x`, `step_ms`, `phase`, (`domains`) | each outer step |
| `output_committed` | `domain`, `valid_time`, `path` | a wrfout is durable on disk |
| `first_products_ready` | `domain`, `valid_time`, `frame`, `paths`, `render_products`, `render_seconds`, `seconds_from_plan_accepted`, `complete` | the first frame's pictures are on disk, while the forecast runs on; `complete` is false when the renderer exited nonzero partway (the pictures it drew are kept and finalize draws the frame again) |
| `model_progress` (polled) | as above plus `source: "stage_progress_file"`, `step_ms: null` | a `prepared` stage that runs as a subprocess, sampled from its own progress file |
| `prepare_head_ready` | `head_sha256` | a chained preparation published its head: `prepare` has just closed and the forecast starts while the later boundary intervals are prepared |
| `prepare_sealed` | `prepared_root`, `prepared` | that preparation sealed (its `proof.json` is written), while the forecast runs on |
| `boundary_wait_started` | `interval`, `reason` | the forecast reached a boundary interval that is not prepared yet |
| `boundary_wait_finished` | `interval`, `seconds` | that interval arrived after `seconds` of waiting |
| `warning` | `code`, `message`, (`detail`, `folder`) | anything worth saying, nothing worth stopping for; `folder` is the scratch folder a `compose_scratch_may_not_fit` warning measured |
| `completed` | `dry_run`, `run_dir`, `receipt_path`, `receipts`, `outputs_committed`, `first_products_seconds`, `summary` | last line, exit 0 |
| `failed` | `stage`, `error_class`, `message`, `remedy`, `run_dir`, `receipts`, (`folders`) | last line, nonzero exit; `folders` lists the folders a refusal names as the place to act (a scratch folder to make room in), which a page keeps in the words it shows |

`stage` ∈ `fetch`, `prepare`, `initialize`, `forecast`, `finalize`.
`fetch` appears only when the plan declares one; every other stage
always emits its pair, so a stage timeline has no holes to interpret.
A chained preparation (a single domain; see PIPELINE-STAGES.md) is the
one stage whose work outlives its pair: `prepare` closes at the head,
`prepare_head_ready` follows, the `forecast` stage opens while the later
boundary intervals are still being prepared, and `prepare_sealed` marks
the end of the preparation wherever it lands among the forecast's
events. A domain tree, and a preparation that declines chaining, closes
`prepare` at its seal as before.
The finer pipeline phases inside a stage are not lost: they arrive on
`stage_started.phase` and the full ordered list on
`stage_finished.phases`.

`speed_x` and `step_ms` are `null` rather than an infinity when no wall
time has elapsed yet. A rate over no elapsed wall is undefined, not
large.

`domains` appears only on a domain tree with more than one clock: a
list of `{domain, model_seconds}` giving each grid's own clock, the
`domain`/`model_seconds` pair at the top level staying the root's. Its
absence means the root **is** the tree, so single-domain consumers see
the stream they always saw.

`output_committed` is raised at the moment the file is genuinely durable
(after the writer has fsynced it, validated it against its own
inventory and renamed it onto its final name) so the event never
announces a file that is merely queued. On the domain-tree route it
arrives from the per-domain writer thread, which is why the stream
serializes writes under a lock.

---

## `cycle: "latest"`

`latest` was already implemented across the fetch machinery before this
front door existed; run-plan does not reimplement it. What it adds is
that the **resolved** cycle is recorded rather than the question.

`resolve_latest_cycle` walks candidate cycles backwards (GFS/GDAS: 6-hourly,
~48 h; HRRR: hourly, 12 h) and accepts the first whose objects for the
**final requested forecast hour** are all published on S3, for HRRR both
the `wrfnat` and its `wrfprs` sibling, since during a live publication
one can appear before the other. So **completeness is structural**: a
partially uploaded cycle cannot win, and the fetched window is complete
by construction. There is no "cycle still receiving files" state to
detect, because such a cycle is never selected.

run-plan resolves `latest` **before** the fetch stage runs and rewrites
the argv with the concrete cycle, for two reasons: a plan that records
`latest` records a question whose answer changes every six hours, and
resolving once removes the window where this front door could report one
cycle while the fetch downloads the next. It is the rule the wizard
already applies to its emitted `[fetch]` table: *the resolved cycle,
never the literal `latest`*.

The concrete cycle lands in `automatic_resolutions`:

```json
{"scope": "fetch", "key": "cycle", "value": "2026-08-07T12",
 "basis": "resolved_latest",
 "note": "the newest cycle whose objects for the final requested hour are all published; a partially uploaded cycle cannot win, so the window is complete by construction"}
```

If the resolved cycle is not the newest the clock allows, newer cycles
exist but are still publishing: the run will initialize from older data
than a caller may assume. That is a **`warning` event, never a refusal**:

```json
{"event": "warning", "code": "latest_cycle_is_not_the_newest",
 "cycle": "2026-08-07T00", "source": "gfs", "age_hours": 20, "last_hour": 6}
```

`latest` is matched case-insensitively here. `woof fetch` compares bare
equality while the wizard and the interactive door lower-case first, so
`--cycle Latest` works on two of the three front doors today; a machine
interface should not inherit that coin flip.

ERA5 has no `latest`: it is a reanalysis published days late, and both
the fetch and the wizard refuse it by name.

---

## Planning before the data exists

`--resolve` and `--estimate` answer *what would this run be*, which has
to work before anything is downloaded. They load the config with the
input-existence check off, so the geometry, physics and VRAM estimate
come back from a plan whose forcing has not been fetched yet.

Nothing is skipped silently. The answer carries the full inventory:

```json
"inputs_present": false,
"declared_inputs": [
  {"role": "forcing", "path": ".../era5-combined.grib", "kind": "file", "present": false},
  {"role": "vtable",  "path": ".../Vtable.ERA5_CDO",    "kind": "file", "present": true},
  ...
]
```

A **run** keeps the check on. The `resolved_plan` event carries the same
inventory, then the fetch stage runs, and the gate fires after it: one
refusal naming every missing input, rather than discovering them one at
a time inside preparation.

## The minimum domain size

`--resolve` reports the floor, and it is **derived from the engine**, not
transcribed:

```json
"domain_size_floor": {
  "root_mass_points": {"nx": 60, "ny": 48},
  "nest_span_mass_points": 12,
  "clearance_rows": 10,
  "basis": "the wizard's fit loop bisects grid scale between _MIN_SCALE and _MAX_SCALE; ... Domain size is FITTED from the ladder and the VRAM budget -- there is no nx/ny input to set."
}
```

60 × 48 is the smallest layout that still hosts the deepest ladder with
full Davies/blend clearance; a nest span below 12 mass points is refused
outright; `clearance_rows` is `spec_bdy_width + blend_width`. The numbers
are computed from the wizard's own fit bracket at call time, so they move
when it moves: a constant copied into a front end would be right until
somebody tuned the bracket, then wrong silently.

When a shape does not fit, the refusal carries the wizard's own sentence
(which names the budget, the layout it bottomed out at, and what to
change) **and** this floor beside it.

---

## stdout is the machine channel

stdout carries JSONL and nothing else. Everything a person would want to
read (the resolved-config report, the wizard's sizing table and next
steps, warnings, the feedback advisory) goes to **stderr**.

This is enforced, not hoped for: `run_plan_main` binds the real stdout
for the event stream and then redirects `sys.stdout` to stderr for the
whole run. The pipeline and the wizard print with plain `print()` and
are correct to; they simply do not get the machine channel.

---

## Attaching to a running run

`<run_dir>/run-manifest.json` (`gpuwm.run-manifest.v1`) is written
before any work starts and names every stream a consumer may want,
including the two `run-plan` does not own:

```json
{
  "schema": "gpuwm.run-manifest.v1",
  "pid": 24188,
  "process": {"pid": 24188, "start": "…", "boot": "…"},
  "started_at_utc": "2026-08-07T18:00:12.104Z",
  "plan_sha256": "…",
  "run_dir":     "…/runs/overnight",
  "outputs_dir": "…/runs/overnight",
  "events_path":           "…/runs/overnight/events.jsonl",
  "events_schema":         "gpuwm.run-plan.event.v1",
  "progress_path":         "…/runs/overnight/run-progress.json",
  "progress_schema":       "gpuwm.run-progress/v1",
  "failure_capsule_path":  "…/runs/overnight/failure-capsule.json",
  "failure_capsule_schema":"gpuwm.failure-capsule/v3"
}
```

### Reattach: read the heartbeat, don't own the pipe

1. Read `run-manifest.json` for the paths and the pid. A pid names a
   process only until it ends; after a crash or a restart another
   program can hold the same number. `process` is the run's own
   identity: the process's creation time (`start`, as the operating
   system reports it) and, on Linux, the boot it belongs to (`boot`,
   `/proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id`). The run is alive only while the
   process holding `pid` has that same identity (`woof.proc_identity`
   compares them); a manifest without `process` cannot prove which
   process it named, so treat its run as ended and never signal its pid.
2. Read `run-progress.json` for **current state**. That file is the
   authoritative anchor: atomically republished on every step, and what
   woof's own recovery reads.
3. Replay `events.jsonl` from byte zero for **history**. It is the
   complete record, never rotated or truncated. Then tail it for live
   detail.

`run-plan` publishes **no progress state of its own**.
`woof.supervisor` already writes `run-progress.json`, and it stays the
only writer of it: the run-plan observer *composes* with
`supervisor.RuntimeHeartbeat` rather than replacing it, so a run-plan
run leaves exactly the heartbeat a `woof run` leaves.

A consumer that treats the event stream as the anchor will be wrong
exactly once: after a crash between the last event flush and the process
exit. The heartbeat is the thing that is durable by design.

A torn final line in `events.jsonl` means the writer died mid-flush.
`read_events` refuses it by default rather than trimming it, because a
reader that silently drops a partial line cannot tell "still going" from
"died here". Pass `allow_partial_tail=True` once you have established
which.

One process writes a run's stream at a time. While a stream is open its
writer holds `.events.jsonl.owner` beside it: the process id, when that
process was created, the host and a random token. A second
`woof run-plan` or `woof go` aimed at a folder whose stream a live
process is writing is refused before it writes a record, and the refusal
names that process. An owner file left by a process that has ended, or
whose process id now belongs to a different process, is taken over; one
written on another machine is never taken over, and the refusal names
the file to delete once nothing runs there. The next writer to open a
stream that ends in a torn line moves those bytes to
`events.jsonl.torn-<UTC time>` beside it, cuts the stream back to its
last whole record and continues the numbering from there, so the history
replays again and nothing the dead writer left is thrown away. The first
record it then writes is a `warning` with code `event_tail_recovered`,
whose `preserved_path` names the file the cut bytes went to.

### Do not touch the checkout a run is reading

If the run is executing out of a git checkout, leave that checkout
alone until it finishes. Committing to it, staging into it, or merely
dropping a scratch file beside it will fail the run, and by design: the
HRRR hierarchy stage samples `git status --short` when it publishes and
refuses a tree with anything uncommitted in it
(`public HRRR hierarchy requires a completely clean source tree`)
because a bundle stamped with a commit it was not actually built from
is a provenance claim that is false. `git status --short` reports
untracked files too, so an editor swap file is enough to do it.

Nothing about this is specific to moving nests; it is just easy to hit
on the prepared HRRR route, where the hierarchy stage runs minutes into
a run rather than at the start. Work in a second worktree, or run from
an installed package: an install has no worktree to dirty, and its
identity comes from the sealed distribution manifest or from pip's own
`RECORD`, neither of which an edit elsewhere on the box can move.

---

## Nothing silent: `automatic_resolutions`

Every value the pipeline chose on its own appears in the
`resolved_plan` event and in `--resolve`, one entry each:

```json
[
  {"scope":"plan","key":"output_root","value":"…/out/run","basis":"front_door_default"},
  {"scope":"run_options","key":"device","value":null,"basis":"schema_default"},
  {"scope":"experiment","key":"blend_width","value":5,"basis":"schema_default"},
  {"scope":"domain","grid_id":2,"key":"dt","value":20.0,"exact":"20",
   "basis":"derived_from_parent_time_step_ratio",
   "note":"parent d01 step divided by parent_time_step_ratio=3"},
  {"scope":"execution","key":"execution_mode","value":"in_process","basis":"front_door_contract"}
]
```

A front end can render that list and a reader can see, before the run,
every number nobody typed. The per-domain timestep is the flagship case:
it changes the model's answer, nobody writes it, and until now it
appeared only inside a printed report.

Library warnings (`woof.explain.warn`) reach the stream as `warning`
events with `code: "library_warning"`, the same fact as fields rather
than as a line to recognize.

---

## Query modes

Each prints exactly one JSON document to stdout and runs nothing.

**`--resolve PLAN.json`** → `gpuwm.run-plan.resolved.v1`. The fully
resolved configuration (the objects the model will actually run, not a
re-read of the TOML), `automatic_resolutions`, `moving_nest`, and any
warnings the load produced. This is the "what will this do?" answer, and
it creates nothing on disk. It is also where a plan that cannot run is
refused: a moving nest on a chain whose preparation cannot feed one is
rejected here, from the config alone, rather than after the fetch.

For an intent plan, `memory` is the card memory the wizard fitted the
grid to: `peak_envelope_bytes` of the binding phase (`binding_phase`)
against `budget_bytes`, with `alloc_estimate_bytes`, the `free_bytes` and
`vram_gib` it was sized from, and `sizing_basis` (`declared-capacity`
for a named card, `measured-available` for this machine's GPU). Every
source fills it, including one whose inputs are fetched only when the
run starts, so a front end reads how close a draft is to its card from
this record rather than from the words printed beside it. It is `null`
for a plan that names its own config; `--estimate` prices that one.

An intent whose grid does not fit its card is refused at exit 2: the
sentence goes to stderr, and stdout carries the memory refusal document
every memory refusal prints (`arwen.configuration-error.v1`, `kind`
`memory`). Its `error` is the whole refusal and its `memory` holds
`peak_envelope_bytes`, `budget_bytes` and `binding_phase` for the layout
that was priced, whether or not preprocessing is priced for the source.
`--estimate` refuses the same intent the same way. Any other refusal
prints nothing on stdout.

**`--estimate PLAN.json`** → `gpuwm.run-plan.estimate.v1`. VRAM from
`woof.core.preflight`'s own itemization: the arithmetic `woof check`
reports, on the CPU, with no CUDA context.

`vram.envelope_basis` says which figure you got. It is `"resident"` for
a plan with no `[tiles]`, and every number beside it is unchanged. It is
`"streamed"` when the config's `[tiles]` table resolves to streaming, and
then `peak_envelope_bytes` is what the card actually has to hold
(`nbuffers` tile buffers of the compute window, priced off the same
`tilestream.autoplan` footprint the run attaches with, **plus the
measured RRTMGP per-call transient**) not the resident itemization,
which describes a run that will not happen. A `vram.streamed` block
carries the tiling, the resident figure it replaced, the two terms of the
peak (`vram_bytes`, what the tiling holds between radiation calls, and
`radiation_transient_bytes`, what an RRTMGP step allocates and frees on
top of it from the first step onward, zero on the rungs that run no
radiation), and `host_bytes`: on a streamed plan the domain lives in
pinned host RAM, so that is a **requirement** of the plan and not a spare
number. `peak_envelope_bytes` keeps its meaning across both (it is the
figure to compare against a card) and only gains accuracy.

Output-frame counts per domain, which are exact. A `corridor` block sizing the statics corridor
a moving nest's preparation will seal (disk and host; zero VRAM), from
the corridor module's own arithmetic rather than an estimate that
merely agrees with it.

A `download` block prices the download the run will make: the plan's
own `fetch` block when it has one, otherwise the config's `[fetch]`
table, which is what the prepared route downloads from. It counts the
objects the fetch will request the way the fetch counts them and prices
each at the size measured for its source and byte transport in
`woof/data/download-bytes.v1.json` (`bytes` left on disk,
`transfer_bytes` moved over the network, `objects`, `leads`, `source`,
`mode`, `basis`). The transport is the one the fetch will take: a GFS
or GDAS cycle older than the grib-filter host keeps is read as whole
objects from the archive when no mode is named, and is priced that
way. A route that composes files after the transfer (a GEFS a/b pair,
a GDPS valid time) keeps the objects beside the composed copy, so
both are counted in `bytes` and only the objects in `transfer_bytes`.
A download already on disk is not counted again: all of the
managed download folder, which is keyed to the request, and in a
folder named by hand (`data_dir`, or a fetch's `out`) only the files a
fetch receipt of the same request names, for the leads this request
asks for. A `disk` block gives
`bytes`, the whole of what the run writes: the download, the
preparation (priced per grid cell from real preparations of the same
chain), the history files, the kept checkpoints and the pictures, each
also given on its own. It is the
projection `woof run-plan` refuses on before its download, and the
figure the event page compares with free disk. A source or transport
with no measured size is left out by name in `disk.unpriced` and
`download.basis`, never priced at a guess. Where this package has no
measured number (wall time for an arbitrary configuration) the field is
`null` **with its `basis` stated**. A front end showing an invented
duration would be showing woof's name on a number woof never
measured.

**`--catalog`** → `gpuwm.run-plan.catalog.v1`. The renderer's product
catalog: what may go in `render_products`. Asked of the renderer, never
transcribed: on a box with the Rust engine that is its own
`--list-products` (150 slugs plus the `all`/`direct`/`derived`/`heavy`/
`windowed` group keywords); on a box with no usable engine it is
`engine: null`, `products: null` and the staging remedy in `error`,
because `woof render` refuses there rather than answering from a second
engine, and a picker built against one catalog and run against the other
would offer products that do not exist. The parse is checked against the renderer's own declared
count, and a disagreement is reported in `parse_warning` with the raw
output carried, rather than silently returning a short list.

**`--sources`** → `gpuwm.run-plan.sources.v1`. The source registry's own
rows: every registered source with its display name, aliases, kind, file
family, decoder, products, forecast horizon, cadence, packaged profile,
coverage window (or `null` for a global product), maturity, credential
prerequisites, and how its bytes are acquired, a table route, its own
legacy transport, or the table's named refusal carried verbatim. The rows
come out in the registry's order, so a picker shows the engine's order
rather than one it invented, and a model added to the registry appears
here with **no code change** on either side of the seam.

`display_name` is the registry's display-name column: the name a person
would say (`HRRR (pressure levels)`, `GEM GDPS (Canadian global)`), not
the id. `title` carries the same string, so a consumer already reading
it shows the name with no change; a row that declares no name reads back
as its id.

`credentials` is what the row declares must be **configured** before its
bytes can be acquired, resolved against the box that answered:
`required`, a one-line `summary`, and an `items` entry per credential
with `display_name`, `location_kind` (`home_file` / `env_var`),
`location`, `location_display` (the path or variable as it is on this
box), `needed_for`, `breakage`, `obtain_url`, `present`, and the
`status_message` to show. Existence only ever leaves the door: the
credential's value is never read. A row that declares nothing says
exactly that; it does **not** say the source is public, which is a
promise about a provider the registry cannot make. Adding a source that
needs an account key is one registry row, and no front end carries an
exception table for it.

Read `run_plan.intent_supported` before offering a launch. The registry
is wider than this front door: it declares more rows than a run-plan
**intent** (a point, a cycle, a source) can drive, and the field is the
**derived** verdict of `woof.runplan.intent_drivability`, registry
facts, never a hand-kept list, so a registered source with a runnable
route, a forcing cadence, an acquisition route and an executable chain
is intent-drivable the moment its row lands. `run_plan.intent_routes`
names the route(s), `run_plan.intent_chain` the prepared-route chain
the dispatch would take, and, on an undrivable row,
`run_plan.intent_refusal` carries the derived sentence naming the
missing fact (no acquisition route, no cadence, no runnable route, a
member the route's grammar cannot bind). Every row is listed either
way,
because a truthful "not from an intent" beats a short menu.
The envelope carries `gpuwm_version` and the registry's `readiness_rule`
and `certification_rule`, so the maturity words a front end shows are the
engine's and not a second vocabulary. The document is roughly 65 kB.

**`--physics-profiles`** → `gpuwm.run-plan.physics-profiles.v1`. The
per-source physics menu: every registered source crossed with every
shipped physics suite, computed against the same admissibility rules
that refuse at emission. This is the answer to "what can THIS model
actually run", which nothing could ask before: a front end that wanted
a physics list had to type one, and a typed list cannot know that the
native HRRR route refuses every Kain-Fritsch suite because its 3 km grid
resolves its own convection.

`profiles[]` is the source-independent half, in the wizard door's own
order (nocturnally valid suites first): `summary`, the scheme selectors,
`day_only` with its reason, `maturity` (the physics registry's template
maturity plus the verification word), `vertical_levels` (the level-count
window every component of the suite accepts, from the same preflight
that refuses a 130-level YSU configuration), and the full `switches`
table.

`sources[]` is the per-source half, in registry order, and its
`profiles[]` list is parallel to the top-level one so a consumer can zip
them. Each cell carries `profile_id`, `admissible`, `why_not` (the
route's own refusal sentence, **verbatim**, never paraphrased, so the
menu and the refusal read as one gate), `is_default`, `day_only`,
`maturity`, and `select_with` (the flag to pass, or `omit
--physics-profile` for the default).

Each source row also carries `default_profile_id` (what a bare run on
that source binds) with `default_basis` saying why, `admissible_count`,
and `nocturnal_remedy`: the way forward when a daytime-only suite meets
a window with local night **on this source**. That field is what the
wizard's own nocturnal refusal now prints, so a printed remedy can never
name a suite the active source's route then refuses.

The default is **derived**, not tabled: the door's declared default when
this source's route admits it and it runs both radiation streams, else
the next suite in the listed order that satisfies both. A source added
to the registry gets a working default with **no code change**, and so
does a suite added to the shipped list.

`spacing_defaults` is the default by grid spacing, which binds ahead of
`default_profile_id` when the run's finest grid is finer than a row's
`finest_dx_below_m`. Each row names its suite (`profile_id`), its
`basis`, and whether this source's route admits it: `admitted` for a
single domain and `admitted_nested` for a domain with nests, each with
the route's own sentence (`why_not`, `why_not_nested`) when it does not.
Today there is one row: below 1 km the default is Thompson with
MYNN and RUC on both radiation streams, the suite that kept coastal fog
and stratus. A run the row does not admit keeps `default_profile_id`.
`admitted_nested` equals `admitted` for every source today: the one
stage that answered differently for a tree, the nested HRRR hierarchy's
soil pin, now pins the soil column its land surface runs.

A plan whose `physics_choices` name no suite records their base in the
run manifest from the configuration the plan resolved to, so an `auto`
ladder, whose depth only its fit knows, records the default of the
ladder the fit landed on.

`admissibility_rules[]` names the rules the cells were computed against
and who owns each one, the route emission gate with its declared
`required_physics` / `admitted_pbl_physics` /
`admitted_radiation_pairs` / `supported_microphysics`, the registry's
land-surface offer declaration, the nocturnal-validity predicate, and
the vertical-level bounds, so a front end can say *why* a cell is
closed without reimplementing the reasoning. The document is roughly
250 kB.

**`--probe`** → `gpuwm.run-plan.probe.v1`. Device inventory (name, UUID,
driver, VRAM total/used/free) read through NVML only: **no CUDA context
is created**, so it is safe to poll on a busy card. Plus route and schema
inventories, and a readiness section delegating to `woof doctor`.

That readiness section **does** create a context: doctor verifies the
estate by execution, including a subprocess that imports CuPy and runs a
2×2 matmul. Pass `--no-readiness` for the NVML-only document when
polling.

---

## Python API

```python
from woof.runplan import (load_plan, resolve_plan, estimate_plan,
                           probe_environment, execute_plan,
                           EventStream, read_events)

plan = load_plan("PLAN.json")
resolution, exp, data = resolve_plan(plan)         # no device work
with EventStream(plan.run_dir / "events.jsonl") as events:
    exit_code = execute_plan(plan, events=events)

history = read_events(plan.run_dir / "events.jsonl")
```

`EventStream(path, mirror=...)`: `mirror` defaults to stdout; pass
`None` for the file only, or any writable stream.

## The observer seam

`run-plan` adds no private hooks. It uses the `progress_callback`
protocol `runtime.run_experiment` already accepted, plus one new
optional hook discovered the same way the existing ones are:

| hook | added by | raised at |
|---|---|---|
| `progress_callback(**event)` | pre-existing | each outer step |
| `.preparing(phase)` | pre-existing | each preparation phase |
| `.starting()` / `.complete()` / `.failed()` | pre-existing | lifecycle |
| `.output_committed(domain=, valid_time=, path=)` | **new** | `runtime._output_committed`, and the per-domain async writer once the file is durable |

Any object carrying those attributes works. A `progress_callback`
without `output_committed` is unaffected: the hook is discovered by
name, and absent means nothing happens.

---

## What the `prepared` route does not reach yet

Single-domain **gfs** and **hrrr** both run, and so do **GFS domain
trees**: `rw-wps` prepares the whole hierarchy in one call, and run-plan
owns the relay the manual chain used to need a person for, the
forecast stage reads the hierarchy document the preparation left in the
prepared root (`proof.json` or `receipt.json`, matched on schema
against the tree runner's own table) and binds its digest for
`woof-prepared-tree-forecast`. The estimate is tree-aware
(`peak_envelope_bytes` beside the pool request) and `model_progress`
carries a per-domain clock list when the tree has more than one domain.
**Multi-domain HRRR** runs as well, on the four-stage chain described
under Routes. **A moving nest on a nested HRRR tree** runs too, as of
the corridor emission on `woof.hrrr_hierarchy_direct`: the tree runner
was always source-agnostic about relocation (it wants a sealed statics
corridor and does not care which preparation sealed it) and what was
missing was purely that nothing on the HRRR path wrote one. It was a
preparation-side change, and that is where it was made; run-plan's part
was to stop refusing and to compose the flag on the right stage.

---

## Selective rendering

Both chains end in `woof render`, and both take the same filter:

```json
"run_options": { "render_products": "composite_reflectivity,sbcape" }
"run_options": { "render_products": "all" }
"run_options": { "render_products": "none" }     // skip the stage
```

The value is `woof render --products`' own spec, passed through
**verbatim**: this front door does not parse or validate it, because the
render command owns that vocabulary and a second copy of it here is the
enumeration drift `render.py`'s own catalog code already refuses to pay
for. Absent leaves the default set exactly as it was, so `woof go`'s
own behaviour is unchanged.

A vertical section (`xsec:<fill>[/<overlay>...]`) is cut along the line
in `render_section`, the same value `woof go --section` and `woof render
--section` take; the plan is refused before anything is fetched when it
names an `xsec:` term and no line:

```json
"run_options": { "render_products": "composite_reflectivity,xsec:QCLOUD=0.01,0.1/wa",
                 "render_section": "38.3,-99.0,38.3,-98.4" }
```

`none` lives in the same field as the product list rather than in a
separate boolean, so "which products" has one answer and not two that
can disagree; it is not a product name in the catalog, so it cannot
collide with one.

Ask `run-plan --catalog` for the list. It is **not** an intent key:
intent mirrors `woof domain`'s flags one for one, and the wizard writes
configs, not pictures.

The HRRR chain has no render step in its printed form; run-plan gives it
`go`'s, so the option means the same thing on both sources.

---

## Time to first plot

The first picture used to wait for the last timestep. It no longer does.

The first frame a forecast commits is the **analysis**: the state the
run was initialised from. WRF's history alarm is true at `t = 0`
(`Clock.history_due`), so that frame is written before a single step is
integrated, and the per-domain writer raises `output_committed` for it
the moment it is fsynced, self-validated and renamed. On a two-hour run
that finished picture then sat on disk for the whole forecast, waiting
for the finalize stage to notice it.

A run that sets `render_products` now renders that frame as it lands, on
a worker thread, concurrent with the forecast, and emits:

```json
{"event":"first_products_ready","domain":1,"valid_time":"2026-07-28T05:00:00","frame":".../wrfout_d01_2026-07-28_05_00_00","paths":["...png"],"render_products":"refl,t2","render_seconds":3.9,"seconds_from_plan_accepted":118.7}
```

`seconds_from_plan_accepted` **is** the TTFP number: wall clock from the
instant the plan was accepted (the instant the person who launched it
started waiting) to the instant the pictures were readable. It is
measured by the engine, on every run, and it lands in `events.jsonl`
beside everything else. The `completed` event repeats it as
`first_products_seconds` (null when nothing was published early), so
comparing two runs does not mean scanning two streams.

It is measured accurately: the event is emitted before the frame is
digested and before the receipt is written, because both of those are
bookkeeping for the finalize stage and hashing a 362 MB history frame
first would have put a second of it inside the number.

Default ON where it can apply, and inert everywhere else. A plan that
names no products (the default) or names `none` gets exactly the
behaviour it had before; the `experiment` route has no `render_products`
option at all and is untouched. There is no second switch.

**It does not contend with the forecast.** The render is a separate
`python -m woof.cli render` process driving the CPU-side Rust renderer.
It imports cupy as a transitive dependency of the package and creates no
CUDA context: measured with the driver itself, `cuCtxGetCurrent`
returning `CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED`, and pinned as a test. The
forecast keeps the card for its whole run.

**Finalize does not redo the work, and does not take that on trust.**
The early render leaves `first-products.json` beside the pictures naming
the frame it read and every PNG it wrote, all by sha256. The finalize
stage collects the render, then drops that frame from its own list only
when the frame still hashes to the recorded digest, every recorded
picture is on disk hashing to its recorded digest, and `render_products`
has not changed. Any other answer (a deleted picture, an edited frame,
a different product spec, a render still running) and the frame is
simply rendered again. Byte-identity between the two paths is a property
of construction: the early render runs the command `render_command`
composes from the same plan, in the same working directory, with the
same environment, naming one frame instead of all of them.

Pictures are published by `os.replace` out of a scratch directory, so a
reader watching the render output sees a whole PNG or none.

`woof go` reads the receipt off disk the same way, whether or not the
chain hosted the render that wrote it: it does not, because `go` asks
the runner subprocess for the early render on its command line and keeps
its process isolation. Every digest check above still gates the skip.

**What the receipt's clock means.** `published_unix_ms` is the wall-clock
instant at which every picture named in `written` was readable at its
final path under the render directory, and the receipt carries that
sentence in its own `measures` field. A picture found there with a later
mtime was rewritten afterwards, so the instant no longer describes
anything on disk; the chain checks that before it quotes the number, and
falls back to the earliest picture's own mtime (labelled as the coarser
measurement) when it does not hold. Before that check, `go` could print
`time to first plot 0m 46s (first-products receipt)` for a run whose
earliest published PNG carried 2m 45s.

### Measured

A real seven-frame `d01-12km` run, 362 MB analysis frame, products
`refl,t2,wind10,precip`, on the RTX 5090 box with the vendored Rust
renderer:

| | wall | output |
|---|---:|---:|
| early render, analysis frame alone | 17.0 s | 4 png |
| finalize render, all 7 frames (before) | 116.0 s | 28 png |
| finalize render, other 6 frames (after) | 100.0 s | 24 png |
| `output_committed` → returns to the writer thread | 0.0007 s | |

`17.0 + 100.0 = 117.0` against `116.0` for one batch, so splitting the
work costs nothing measurable, and the 17 s is hidden under a forecast
that is still running. The product set is unchanged: 28 pictures either
way, 4 of them published by the early render and skipped at finalize
with the message

```
-- render: 1 frame already published by the early render (4 picture(s), digests verified): wrfout_d01_...
```

All four early pictures are **byte-identical** to the same frame
rendered inside the seven-frame finalize batch.

What this buys on a live run is the render delta (100 s of the 116 s
moves off the critical path) **plus the entire forecast wall time**,
because the first plot no longer waits for the last timestep. Against
the reference HRRR budget (208.6 s fetch, 27 s prepare, both measured)
the emitted number for this frame was `seconds_from_plan_accepted:
253.2`.

### What fetch ordering does and does not buy

The other half of TTFP is the download, which on a live HRRR run is
~85% of it. The analysis frame needs only the analysis hour's files, so
the obvious lever is to fetch those first and let the boundary hours
stream while preparation runs.

**They are already fetched first.** Every ladder builder
(`gfs_forecast_hours`, `gdas_forecast_hours`, `hrrr_forecast_hours`)
returns an ascending `range` beginning at the forecast-start lead, and
every fetch loop walks it in order: HRRR fetching both of an hour's
products before touching the next hour. Reordering therefore buys
**zero seconds**; there is nothing to reorder. That property was
incidental and is now pinned (`tests/test_fetch_analysis_first.py`), because
it is what any future overlap work would stand on.

Pinned alongside it is the property such work would have to preserve:
`SHA256SUMS` (the artifact preparation binds through
`--source-manifest-sha256`) is **byte-identical whatever order the
hours land in**, proven by fetching the same window forwards and
backwards and comparing, not by reading the `sorted` call that makes it
true. The payload files come out byte-for-byte identical too.

The gain that ordering was supposed to unlock is **overlap**:
preparation starting on the analysis hour while boundaries download.
That is not available today, and the obstacle is not the digest
discipline: it is the shape of preparation:

* Root preparation is one pass over the whole series. The decoder is
  invoked once with the series file, and the same loop that builds the
  initial condition from `snapshots[0]` accumulates every snapshot's
  perimeter into the boundary tables and seals them into the prepared
  cache (`gfs_direct.py`). There is no later "LBC step" to defer to.
* Three independent gates refuse a one-time series outright
  (`gfs_direct._read_series`, `gfs_direct.prepare_gfs_wrf`,
  `ingest/lateral_bc.build_lateral_boundaries`), and the HRRR preparer
  refuses if any hour's atmosphere or soil file is missing.
* The sealed manifest binds the **role set**, not just the bytes:
  preparation refuses when the manifest's declared roles differ from the
  ones it was asked for. Preparing from a subset means authoring a
  manifest over that subset, which is a different sealed artifact with a
  different digest, and the runner binds exactly one
  `--source-manifest-sha256`.

Splitting that is a preparation-format change (an IC-only artifact, a
runner that can start from one, and a second seal for the boundary
extension), not plumbing. It was **not** done here, because the only
ways to do it quickly all weaken a digest binding to win seconds. The
receiving end for a future attempt already exists: the fetch receipt is
republished after every completed hour, with `forecast_hours` naming the
verified prefix, so "the analysis is on disk and checked" is already an
observable event.

Fetch **parallelism** is separately debunked on this link: six
concurrent streams aggregate 20.2 MB/s against 17.9 MB/s for one, a
1.29x that is bandwidth-limited, not a 6x. It is also the wrong
direction: concurrency stops the analysis hour landing first, which is
the one property the overlap work above would need.
