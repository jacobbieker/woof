# The radar-DA nowcast front door (demo-grade)

**First time here?**  Read
[`da-nowcast-quickstart.md`](da-nowcast-quickstart.md) instead: it covers
install, the GPU and cuSOLVER prerequisites, the interactive launcher,
the continuous daemon, and the failures you are likely to hit.  This page
is the reference for the pipeline itself.

One command takes any WSR-88D site id and a time window and produces a
cycled, ensemble, GPU-LETKF nowcast with a map-styled gallery that
verifies itself as reality arrives:

```
python -m tools.da_nowcast run --site XXXX --window-end latest --out CASE_DIR
```

That is the whole command.  **Verification is automatic**: when the run
finishes it hands the case to a detached rolling verifier that grades
each free-forecast frame as the archive covers its valid time, updates
the gallery in place, and stops with a verdict.  `--no-verify` opts
out; the same verifier can be started or re-run by hand later:

```
python -m tools.da_nowcast watch  --case-dir CASE_DIR   # roll until graded
python -m tools.da_nowcast verify --case-dir CASE_DIR   # one pass, then stop
```

## What it accurately is

A **demo**, productized from the live-fire engineering exercises
(receipts under `evidence/da-demo/`).  It is UNSCORED and outside any
registered campaign.  Defaults are the demo shape: **N=10 members**,
six applied 15-minute cycles, six free forecast legs, a single 3 km
domain sized to the radar's range authority.  Every figure it emits
carries that statement; free-forecast panels are stamped
"PAST LAST OBS" until an observed counterpart exists.

For how this configuration compares to the Warn-on-Forecast System --
members, domain, observations, compute, and why the FSS below does not
sit next to a published WoFS number -- see
[`da-vs-wofs.md`](da-vs-wofs.md).  That page also scores the demo against
the **operational HRRR**, the one external baseline that could be scored:
on one case it wins across the whole 90-minute free forecast, with the
margin peaking near +45 min and spent by +1:30.  The window is part of the
result -- quoting the win without it misstates the page -- and the HRRR
ingests strictly more radar data than this demo does.

Two capabilities live beside this quickstart rather than in it, because
each is optional and each changes what a run costs:

- [`da-nested-forecast.md`](da-nested-forecast.md) -- a fine one-way nest
  that runs inside the parent over the FREE forecast legs, inheriting the
  analysis rather than resampling it.  Reached with the `--nest-*` flags
  on `tools/da_cycle_prepared.py`; the parent is proven bitwise unchanged
  by the nest's presence.
- [`da_jacobi_eigensolver.md`](da_jacobi_eigensolver.md) -- the batched
  Jacobi kernel that factors the LETKF's own matrices.  There is no CLI
  flag for it: at `--solve-device cuda` and 2-64 members it is simply
  what runs, which means cuSOLVER is no longer required for radar DA.
  `woof doctor` reports a "radar-DA eigensolver" line, and each cycle
  report now names the solver that produced it under
  `filter.eigensolver`.

Known limits, stated up front:

- **No skill claim.**  The verification numbers (>=35 dBZ column
  counts in the echo mask; FSS at 30 dBZ / 27 km via
  `woof.verify.field_metrics`) are demo-grade diagnostics, not
  campaign scores.  N=10 is far below what ensemble calibration wants.
- **No velocity dealiasing** -- the obs ladder masks fold-risk
  signatures and counts every rejection (`tools/obs_radar_grid_build.py`
  provenance), which is not the same thing as unwrapping.
- **HRRR background by default** (project ruling, 2026-08-06: permanent;
  `--source gfs` is retained for archival reproduction of pre-HRRR
  runs), with the no-radiation WSM6/YSU demo profile.
- **Prepared cases are host-bound** -- preparation runs on the local
  box, by receipted finding; do not point the front door at remote
  prep.
- Storm motion for domain siting is **centroid displacement** between
  two volumes: it mixes advection with growth/decay and is used only
  to bias the domain downstream, never as a forecast.

## What to expect from the pictures

Read this before comparing a forecast panel to a radar panel, because
the accurate target is narrower than the imagery suggests:

> **Band placement, orientation and convective mode by T+30..T+60 is
> the winnable target. A cell-for-cell match at T+90 storm scale is
> not winnable at any setting.**

Three separate reasons, none of them a defect:

1. **Predictability.** Individual convective cells have a useful
   lifetime of tens of minutes. No initial condition, ensemble size or
   resolution recovers a particular cell's position an hour and a half
   out; what survives is the system -- the band, its axis, its mode.
2. **Effective resolution.** A finite-difference core resolves roughly
   seven grid lengths, so a 1.5 km run resolves ~10 km features while
   the observed composite carries gate-scale texture. Placed side by
   side at native texture the forecast will always look too smooth,
   even when it is right. The per-member verification strips
   (`09-verification-*.png`) therefore show the observed field twice:
   at gate texture, and box-averaged in linear Z to the model's own
   resolving power. FSS is computed against the RAW observation in
   both cases, so the numbers never flatter the display.
3. **What the analysis can constrain.** Radial velocity alone nudges
   winds; it does not tell the filter where echo is and is not. A
   velocity-only single-radar analysis therefore leaves every member
   carrying the background's own misplaced storms -- the ensemble
   agrees with itself and disagrees with the radar. Assimilating
   reflectivity beside velocity (`--reflectivity-analysis` with
   `--hydrometeors` and an explicit `--positivity-policy`) is what
   moves placement; measured on one 1.5 km HRRR case (ktbw, 2026-08-06)
   it raised mean member FSS30 from 0.559 to 0.700 while member-to-
   member agreement barely moved. The members did not become more
   diverse; they became more correct. That is the intended behaviour,
   and it is also why an ensemble that looks tight is not automatically
   an ensemble that is confident.

   **That result is not the wider analysis on its own.** It was
   measured with the hot start on, which is the default. On one
   measured case with the hot start turned off, the wider analysis
   collapsed the storm FASTER than the velocity-only analysis did --
   so the wider set is not strictly better than winds alone, and a page
   that says it is would be describing a configuration nobody ran. What
   the two measurements together say is that the wider set needs
   condensate already in the background to correct, and the hot start
   is what puts it there. See **The three findings that pick a cycle's
   configuration** below.

## What one run does

1. **survey** -- S3 listing for the site; archive freshness measured
   and enforced (default ceiling 15 min; `--allow-stale` to override);
   two volumes decoded through the rw_nexrad seam; echo census and
   centroid-displacement motion.  The listing window ends at the
   moment the run is ABOUT: the `--window-end` that was asked for, or
   now when it was `latest`.  A replay of an archived hour is surveyed,
   sited and timed on that hour's own volumes, and the survey receipt
   carries `clock` (`window` or `wall`) and `listing_window` so a case
   read later says which it was.
2. **domain** -- a range-authority-sized box centered on the echo,
   biased downstream by the measured motion and clamped so the radar
   keeps observing the grid, emitted by the `woof domain` wizard
   (config and WPS namelist are never hand-typed).
3. **prepare** -- authority materialization, GFS fetch, front-door
   manifest, prepared cache -- all hash-chained, all on this box.
4. **forecast** -- the georeference run that gives every observation
   its grid and every verification its wrfout.
5. **obs** -- one `gpuwm-obs.radar-grid.v1` file per cycle.
6. **cycle** -- N-member cycled LETKF (`tools/da_cycle_prepared.py`,
   CUDA solves by default) with free forecast legs past the last
   observation.  Every leg of every trajectory, free legs included,
   leaves a frame in `CASE_DIR/cycle/composites/`: a column-max
   composite `legNN_<trajectory>.npz` and the same field as a real
   wrfout beside it (`wrfout_legNN_<trajectory>.nc`) for `woof render
   --engine rust`.  The receipt names that directory and the free legs
   under `outputs.forecast_frames`.  A nest over the free legs is asked
   for with `--nest-half-width-km` (or `--nest-nx`/`--nest-ny`) and
   writes the same pair beside them under a `_d02` name, so the child
   draws through the same renderer as the parent.  Parent and child
   frames are one-level surface snapshots, and composite reflectivity
   is the field drawable from either.
7. **render** -- the map-styled gallery (`tools/da_nowcast_render.py`):
   WOOF product-map frame from the vendored basemap assets, one
   reflectivity scale, accuracy stamps throughout.

8. **verify** -- the handoff: a detached `watch` process polls the
   archive, builds each free-forecast frame's observed composite as
   its valid time gets covered, re-renders the gallery (counts and FSS
   on every pair, observed above forecast at the same valid time), and
   exits once the last frame is graded or its safety ceiling is hit.

## The defaults, and the measurements behind them

Set 2026-08-05 from runs on three cards.  Each number below is a
measurement with a receipt, not a preference; the code carries the same
citations (`tools/da_nowcast.py`, `DEFAULT_MEMBERS` and
`DEFAULT_MEMORY_BUDGET_MIB`).

### Ensemble size: `--members 10`

Bigger is not better here, and the reason is in the metric.  FSS is
computed on the ensemble **mean** composite, and these forecasts already
under-produce echo -- about 2,000 columns over 35 dBZ against about
2,800 observed.  Averaging pulls peaks down, so the mean field clears
30 dBZ in fewer places and moves *away* from truth as N grows.  Holding
one N=20 analysis fixed and varying only the averaging depth
(`evidence/da-demo/ensemble-size-sweep/skill-decomposition-partial.json`):

| depth | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 10 | 16 | 20 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FSS | .7470 | .7451 | .7435 | .7428 | .7425 | .7425 | .7423 |

The measured skill-and-cost ladder, same case and same scorer
throughout, mean FSS over the six free-forecast leads:

| N | FSS (32 GB) | wall (32 GB) | FSS (16 GB) | wall (16 GB) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | -- | -- | 0.7331 | 431 s |
| 10 | **0.7408** | **465 s** | **0.7397** | **727 s** |
| 20 | 0.7423 | 847 s | 0.7435 | 1163 s |
| 36 | 0.7396 | 1826 s | -- | -- |

Receipts: `evidence/da-demo/ensemble-size-sweep/n{10,20,36}/` and
`evidence/16gb-frontier/runs/f198n{04,10,20}/`.

- **Up from 10 is not distinguishable from zero.**  With averaging depth
  held at 10 for both, analysis quality alone gives 0.7408 at N=10 and
  0.7426 at N=20: +0.0018.  Per member -- the statistic averaging cannot
  flatter -- +0.0038.  The across-member FSS scatter is 0.0062 at N=10
  and 0.0074 at N=20, larger than either effect, and the per-member
  difference is t = 1.47.  The price is +82% wall clock.
- **N=36 scores below N=10** on the mean field (0.7396 vs 0.7408) at
  3.9x the wall clock.
- **Down from 10 is measurably worse and saves nothing**: N=4 costs
  0.007 FSS at +15 min and 0.008 at +90, and leaves peak VRAM where it
  was.
- **N=36 is also where it starts to fall over.**  The N=36 arm of the
  2026-08-05 local sweep ran 1527 s and then died with
  `CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY` copying back from the device, on a 32 GB
  card at the default 6144 MiB budget.  The card was shared with other
  work at the time, so this is not "N=36 needs more than 32 GB" -- it
  is "at N=36 the default budget leaves no room for a neighbour", which
  is the failure mode a first run should not meet.

One caveat on the cost column, stated because it is unresolved: the
N=36 timings were taken with cuSOLVER, and this tree now factors the
LETKF's own matrices with a batched Jacobi kernel by default.  The
*skill* half of the table is unaffected (the two solvers agree to about
1e-11); the *cost* half at large N is provisional.

### Memory: `--memory-budget-mib 6144`, and peak does not scale with N

The driver holds one trajectory on the GPU at a time and frees the pool
between members, so the ensemble is a **time** budget, not a memory one.
Measured whole-card peak on a 16,376 MiB RTX 4080, at 4 Hz with stage
markers (`evidence/16gb-frontier/runs/*/vram.json`):

| N | peak VRAM | % of card | chunk points |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | 15,946 MiB | 97.4% | 17,316 |
| 10 | 15,888 MiB | 97.0% | 6,912 |
| 20 | 15,796 MiB | 96.5% | 3,444 |

Peak is flat in N and what motion there is runs the *wrong* way.  The
last column is why: `letkf` sizes its chunk as `budget // per_point` and
`per_point` scales with members, so chunk points fall as 1/N while the
chunk's **bytes** stay pinned to `--memory-budget-mib`.  The model is

```
peak = 2 fields x N x nx x ny x nz x 8 B     (143 MB at N=10 here)
     + a chunk workspace pinned to --memory-budget-mib
     + whatever high-water CuPy's pool churn leaves behind
```

Only the middle term is under the operator's control, which is why it is
now reachable from the front door instead of only from the cycle driver.

**The default is measured-to-fit, not measured-optimal.**  15,888 MiB is
97.0% of a 16 GB card with 488 MiB spare, for a few seconds per cycle,
against a median of 2,168 MiB.  Lower it if you want margin.  The
budget ladder that would choose a better default, and the CuPy pool-cap
probe beside it (`tools/ens_sweep/pool_limit_probe.sh`, caps at
16/12/8/6/4 GiB), had **not finished** when these defaults were set, so
the shipped 6144 is unchanged rather than guessed at.

### `--profile card-16gib`

The 16 GB frontier produced a profile, and its content is that nothing
has to change:

```
python -m tools.da_nowcast run --site XXXX --window-end latest \
    --profile card-16gib --out CASE_DIR
```

The shipped demo shape -- N=10, 3 km, 49 levels, 198 km box half-width,
six applied 15-minute cycles, six free legs -- ran to completion on a
16,376 MiB RTX 4080 and returned the 32 GB card's answer: mean FSS
0.7397 over six leads against 0.7403 for the same case on the 5090, and
innovation RMS tracking the 32 GB run within 0.35 m/s cycle by cycle
across all six cycles.  (Not a controlled pair: driving today's wizard
with the shipped 198 km box half-width fits 136x134 on the node against
the 132x132 the 32 GB run recorded, 4.9% more cells at the same dx,
centre, radar and valid times.)  Cycle stage 533.8 s against 506 s on
the 5090; the solve is about 1.55x slower -- 65.3 s against 42.2 s
summed over six cycles -- because it is bandwidth-bound, while the
forecast legs run at near parity (3.4 s against 3.15 s per member-leg)
because at 893k state points they are launch-latency-bound.

So the profile does not shrink the run.  It points the memory preflight
at the card that is actually in the box (`--vram-gib 16`), which the
wizard would otherwise guess, and it names a configuration that has been
run rather than estimated.  An explicit flag always beats the profile.

Recorded while there: on sm_89 NVRTC `--ftz=false` **is** effective and
FP32 subnormals survive, as the tree's receipt records for the
direct-NVRTC routes on sm_120 as well
(`evidence/16gb-frontier/receipts/ftz_probe_sm89.json`, with its
negative control; the same file shows CuPy's own compile route flushing
on the 4080 too).  The shortwave chain's subnormal countermeasure is
inline PTX without `.ftz`: the receipt's R5 arm keeps subnormals on
sm_120 riding the loader's tuple (`ieee-agreement` on the four
mechanisms PTX can express), the committed bit table reproduced on an
sm_89 card through the same arm (`evidence/ftz-side-readings-20260919/`),
and what fixes that instruction's behaviour is the PTX ISA, not the
option tuple.

### Off by default, and why

Both of these are opt-in.  One of them is reachable from this front
door now; the other is not in this tree at all.

- **The fine free-forecast nest** (`--nest-*`, default off, on
  `tools/da_cycle_prepared.py` AND on this front door, which forwards
  the driver's own flags).  The parent is proven bitwise unchanged by
  the nest's presence.  Its cost model is still *computed* --
  `evidence/da-nested-forecast/cost-model.json` says `"basis":
  "computed (woof.core.preflight), not measured"` -- and the computed
  prices, for scale, are 176 MiB and about 47 s added to a control-only
  free forecast at a 60 km half-width, about 513 s if every member
  carries one.  A MEASURED pair is owed: the same replay was run with
  and without a 45 km half-width nest on the control and one member,
  two free legs at 3 km, but the two arms met different card loads --
  one began its cycle stage on an idle card, the other on a card at 70
  percent -- so no measured cost is quoted from it.  It stays opt-in
  until that pair and the three-arm comparison exist, which is what the
  table below is waiting on.
- **Concurrent member advance** (`--member-workers`).  Not in this tree
  at all: the lane carrying it was held out of the integration with its
  byte-identity proof still open, and its extracted worker had three
  silent failures on the resume path.  There is nothing to enable.

### On by default: the radial-velocity dispersion gate

Radial velocity updates theta and vapour through the ensemble's
cross-covariances.  Where the ensemble is under-dispersed in Vr (its
innovations far larger than its spread and the observation error explain),
those covariances are noise with a large gain.  On a storm-scale
four-minute cycle (3 km parent, 1 km child, one radar) the first analysis
put 6.44 Mt of vapour into a box where no radar saw a storm, and the model
built storms there.  Keeping Vr off theta and vapour everywhere removed it
but starved the cycled storm (footprint rain 0.083 against 0.396).

So a Vr batch whose innovation variance over all its gates is more than 3
times its ensemble plus observation error variance is withheld from theta
and vapour in the columns whose local ratio exceeds 2; theta and vapour
there come from the same analysis without that batch.  The first
analysis's batches measured 4.68 (child) and 3.72 (parent) and every cycled
batch at most 1.97, so once the ensemble has cycled nothing is withheld.
`--velocity-dispersion-gate RATIO|none` and
`--velocity-dispersion-batch-gate RATIO|none` set or switch off either
condition, and every analysis receipt carries the ratios per batch under
`velocity_dispersion`, gate on or off (`woof/da/velocity_dispersion.py`).
Any number of radars may be gated in one analysis (each radar is its own
Vr batch, and a first analysis gates every one of them); each solve
without a withheld set runs over the box around the columns it writes and
the observations within their reach, so it costs what those columns cost
and not what the domain does.

### The three findings that pick a cycle's configuration

This page is where these belong: it is the one the quickstart names as the
reference for the pipeline, it is the page that holds *The defaults, and
the measurements behind them*, *Off by default, and why* and *Pending
measurement*, and it is therefore the page a reader is on when they decide
what a cycle will run. [`da-nested-forecast.md`](da-nested-forecast.md)
owns the nest and [`da-background-source.md`](da-background-source.md)
owns the background; neither owns the cycle.

All three were measured on this engine's own radar cycle, on real
observations, one storm each.  They are measurements, not laws: one case
each, and stated as one case each.

**1. The hot start is what keeps a storm alive through the first cycles,
and the wider analysis is not strictly better than winds alone.**  The hot
start is the reflectivity insertion that runs before the first analysis.
It is on by default; `--no-hotstart` turns it off. On one measured case it
was worth **42 minutes of storm life** on its own.  On the same case with
it off, the full analysis -- reflectivity and hydrometeors beside the
winds -- **collapsed the storm faster than a wind-only analysis did**.  So
the analysis variable set is not a ladder with winds at the bottom: the
wider set corrects condensate the background already carries, and on a
background that carries none the hot start is what puts it there for the
filter to work on.  Turning the hot start off is a decision about whether
the run has a storm at the end, not a tuning detail.

**2. A ladder is chosen together with the time step it will run at.** The
vertical Courant number of an updraft through a layer is `w*dt/dz`, so
halving the layer doubles it, and past 1 WRF's vertical-velocity limiter
pushes the w tendency against the motion
(`woof.core.dycore.apply_w_damping`).  It is a limiter, not physics: the
run stays up and the updraft pays.  It acts only where the run carries
`w_damping = 1`; this tree's own default is 0 (`woof/config.py:113`) and
the value comes from the imported namelist, so a run is in one regime or
the other and the preflight line below is how you tell which.  Past 1 with
the limiter OFF is not the safe case, it is a different one: the vertical
advection is then outside its stability limit with nothing damping it.  On
one measured case, same storm, same minute, same analysis: a 49-level
ladder ran the band at **643 m layers** and a vertical Courant number of
**0.79** at the 15 s parent step, with no cell over 1; the same band
stacked to layers specified at 200 m, **198 m as built**, under the same
step ran **1.41** with **606 cells over 1**, its strongest updraft halved
from **33.9 m/s to 18.5 m/s**, and the area it held above 45 dBZ lasted
**25 minutes against 53**.  The ladder was right and nothing priced the
step it needed.  Two surfaces say it before a card is spent.  Both are in
2.7.6; a 2.7.5 install has neither.

- `tools/build_stretched_eta_ladder.py` takes **`--dt SECONDS`** and
  prices the ladder over a height band.  With it the tool prints `priced
  at dt`, `thinnest layer in band`, `vertical Courant` (with `-- HOLDS` or
  `-- OVER 1: the limiter ... fires here`) and `step for Courant 0.80`,
  and the emitted score carries a `time_step` block: `dt_s`, `w_max_ms`,
  `band_m`, `thinnest_layer_in_band_m`, `mean_layer_in_band_m`,
  `vertical_courant_in_band`, `target_courant`, `holds`, `dt_for_target_s`
  and `limiter`, which names the routine itself:
  `woof/core/dycore.py::apply_w_damping`.  **`--w-max M/S`** is the
  updraft the ladder has to carry (default 35, the measured peak of a
  strong convective storm), **`--price-band BOTTOM,TOP`** is the height
  band the step is priced over, in metres, the part of the column an
  updraft occupies, and **`--target-courant`** is the number the named
  step aims at (default 0.8).  There is no default band: without `--dt`
  the tool has no opinion about the step, because it would have to
  invent the updraft to have one, and `--dt` with no `--price-band` is
  refused naming the flag and what it means.
- `tools/da_cycle_prepared.py` prints one preflight line under `preflight
  OK`, and only when `w_damping = 1`: **`vertical limiter: thinnest layer
  <N> m at <H> m, so w_damping starts limiting above <W> m/s at
  dt=<DT>`**.  That onset is `dz/dt` and depends on nothing but the ladder
  and the step: no storm and no assumption enters it.  The layer it reads
  is the thinnest one **between 2 km and 12 km**, the part of the column a
  convective updraft occupies: below the floor the layers are thin because
  the boundary layer needs them and the velocities there are small, and
  above the ceiling they can be thin again in the anvil and the
  stratosphere for reasons that have nothing to do with updrafts.  The
  reference model's own 60-level ladder makes that concrete: its thinnest
  layer above 2 km sits at 18.7 km.  The line is a floor on where limiting
  can begin, not a promise that it will, and it is absent when the limiter
  is off or the column cannot be read, because a diagnostic is never worth
  failing a run over.  An absent line means the limiter is not armed; it
  does not mean the ladder and the step suit each other.  Price them with
  `--dt` either way.

**3. Level count is not a free lever.**  On one storm, four ladders were
run and the **60-level ladder was the worst of the four**.  More levels is
not a better forecast, and the count on its own says nothing about a
ladder: two ladders of the same count put their layers in different
places, and a ladder that is right about where its layers go can still be
wrong about the step that has to run them (finding 2).  Judge a ladder on
the storm, with its step, against what the storm did.  Never by count.

### Pending measurement

Left at the current default deliberately, to be revisited when the run
that would settle it lands:

| Default | Left at | What is still running |
|---|---|---|
| `--memory-budget-mib` | 6144 | the 3-budget ladder at N=36, and `pool_limit_probe.sh` (CuPy pool caps at 16/12/8/6/4 GiB) |
| nested free forecast | off | the measured unnested / nest-control / nest-ensemble A/B |
| `--members` cost model | -- | N=64, and whether the N=36 solve cost survives the Jacobi kernel |
| launcher solve estimate | linear in N | the superlinear term's size on this tree's solver |

## Watching the grade arrive

The free forecast runs past the last observation, so its grade does
not exist when the run ends.  The verifier is what closes that gap
without a human in the loop.  Its state lives in the run's own
receipt, under `verification`:

| state | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `pending` | frames known, verifier not started |
| `rolling` | a detached verifier is grading as the archive fills |
| `complete` | every free-forecast frame carries numbers |
| `incomplete` | the verifier stopped with frames still uncovered |
| `disabled` | `--no-verify` |

Beside it sit a verdict line, the watcher's pid, log and command line,
and one entry per frame with its status and its numbers.  The renderer
is the only place counts and FSS are computed; the verifier copies the
rows it publishes, so the receipt and the figures cannot disagree.
Polling that one file is enough to drive a progress display:

```
python - <<'PY'
import json, pathlib

## Which feed serves the observations

There are two routes to the same decoder, and the observation builder
picks between them with `--source`:

| mode | behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `auto` (default) | prefer the real-time chunk feed; fall back to the archive when it cannot cover the request, recording why |
| `live` | the chunk feed or a refusal -- never a quiet fallback |
| `archive` | one Archive-II file per finished volume, the route this pipeline opened with |

The archive bucket only gains a volume file when the volume **ends**, so
its newest object is on average half a volume period old and at worst a
whole one.  The chunk feed publishes the same bytes in ~110 LDM records
as they are collected.  Measured on 2026-08-05 from this box, both
routes driven through `woof.obs.radar_source.acquire_volume` at the
same instant for the same site:

| route | volume | feed lag | fetch + decode | end to end |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| live, mid-scan | 97 of a still-turning volume | **0.0 s** | 3.6 s | **3.6 s** |
| live, newest complete | the finished volume | 382 s | 4.1 s | 386 s |
| archive | the same finished volume | 386 s | 5.3 s | 391 s |

`feed lag` is the newest object's S3 `LastModified` against the bucket's
own `Date` header, so it measures the feed and not this host's clock;
the receipt records the skew separately.  The live and archive routes'
finished volumes are **byte-identical** -- same sha256 -- because a
chunk-prefix concatenation is the archive file, not a re-encoding of it.

One instant is not an accurate number for the archive, whose lag swings
from ~0 right after a volume lands to the whole volume period just
before the next one does.  Polled every 30 s across more than one volume
period on two sites, listing only:

| site | samples | live lag min/median/max | archive lag min/median/max |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| one 410 s VCP | 24 | 0 / **2** / 4 s | 18 / **197** / 406 s |
| one 197 s VCP | 24 | 0 / **1.5** / 5 s | 4 / **95** / 186 s |

Receipts: `evidence/da-demo/live-feed/`.  There is **no skill claim**
here.  This measures when an observation becomes readable, not whether
assimilating it earlier forecasts better.

### Partial volumes

A live assembly that stops mid-scan ends on an LDM block boundary and
decodes into the radials that arrived.  That is what puts the lag under
the scan time itself, and it is never implied:

- it must be asked for (`--allow-partial`, off by default);
- it is published as `{SITE}{YYYYMMDD}_{HHMMSS}_{FMT}_P{NNN}`, a name
  the archive key parser refuses, so nothing downstream can mistake it
  for a finished volume;
- the receipt and the NetCDF provenance carry `feed`, `partial_volume`,
  `chunks`, every object key, and the measured `feed_lag_seconds`;
- `--min-chunks` (front-door default 2) refuses an assembly too short to
  hold a radial at all.  Six data chunks make a full 360-degree sweep at
  0.5-degree azimuth spacing, so `--min-chunks 7` asks for one complete
  low tilt.

A gap in the chunk sequence truncates the assembly at the last usable
chunk and says so in `truncation`; a missing sequence-1 chunk or two
objects claiming one sequence number refuse the volume outright.
Nothing is padded, and nothing is skipped quietly.

## Surface reports every minute

A METAR reaches a cycle of a few minutes only at the few analyses after the
top of the hour.  The archive's one-minute ASOS pages give the same
stations a report every minute, through the same station table and seam:

```
python tools/obs_fetch_asos.py --product asos1min --networks IA_ASOS \
    --bbox=-94.2,41.3,-93.2,42.2 --start 2024-05-21T12:00:00Z \
    --end 2024-05-21T12:30:00Z --slack-minutes 5 --out CACHE/asos1min
```

writes `CACHE/asos1min/surface.json` (`gpuwm-obs.asos-surface.v2`,
provenance `iem-asos-1min`), which `--surface-obs` takes as it takes a
METAR record.  Decode strides the valid times by one minute and each report
serves the minute it was taken; the seam assimilates the report nearest
each analysis, once.  The route answers only by station, and not every
ASOS site has one-minute pages for every day, so the decode names the
stations that answered.  Raw commands: `rw_asos fetch --product asos1min`
and `rw_asos decode --product asos1min` (`rw_asos --help`).

## Seam for tooling

Everything is CLI + versioned JSON: each stage writes a receipt under
`CASE_DIR/receipts/` (`gpuwm-da.nowcast-stage.v1`, survey
`gpuwm-da.nowcast-survey.v1`), and a run ends with
`CASE_DIR/nowcast-receipt.json` (`gpuwm-da.nowcast.v1`) naming every
output and carrying the `gpuwm-da.nowcast-verification.v1` state
machine, rewritten atomically on every verifier tick so a poller never
reads a half-written file.  A GUI can drive the front door on this
seam without parsing any transcript.

Sites, times, and buckets are **arguments**.  No radar-site name
appears in this machinery, its defaults, or its identifiers, and
`tests/test_da_nowcast.py` checks that mechanically.
