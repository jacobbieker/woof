# A fine nest over the radar-DA cycle

EXPERIMENTAL. Nothing here is on a default route.

The nowcast assimilates and forecasts on a single coarse domain.
Interpolating its final output to a finer mesh produces an unbalanced
field that spends its first 15–30 minutes adjusting, exactly the window
a nowcast exists to serve. This runs a real one-way nest over every
leg instead, observed and free, so the fine field is produced by the
model and takes lateral forcing from the parent at every parent step.
The child crosses each leg boundary inside its trajectory's restart set
(the same tree checkpoint `woof run --restart` reads: its atmosphere,
its soil and surface state, its accumulators, its held tendencies and
its clock) and takes its parent's analysis as a correction (two raw
interpolations of the parent, differenced over the analysed fields)
rather than being rebuilt from it, so a window compared across the
observed-to-free handoff is not measuring the child's birth. A nest
born on a later leg activates at that leg's boundary: its physics
counts that step as its step one, exactly as a nest WRF starts mid-run
does, and every later leg finds that birth in the child's own
checkpoint header.

## What you set

Everything about the child except these keys is derived. `dx`, `dy` and
`dt` come off the parent through the ratio chain and are never typed.

```
--nest-half-width-km 60      # or --nest-nx / --nest-ny in child cells
--nest-ratio 3               # space AND time; 3 off 3 km is 1 km at 5 s
--nest-members 0             # default: the control trajectory only
--free-legs 6                # the nest covers every leg, observed and free
```

Optional: `--nest-i-parent-start` / `--nest-j-parent-start` (default is
centred in the parent), `--nest-history-interval-s` (default is the
parent's), `--nest-acknowledge` (deliberate acceptance of an
admissibility refusal).

Price it before running it:

```
python -m tools.da_nest_cost --parent-leg-seconds 34.5 --trajectories 11
```

## What the code permitted, and what it did not

woof has three ways to give a run a child domain. None of them is
"introduce a nest mid-run", and the one that looks closest is the wrong
one:

- **Whole-run live nest.** `build_experiment` initialises every child
  eagerly at t=0. Proven, but it would carry the nest through the DA
  cycling as well.
- **Delayed per-domain `start_time`.** Implemented, and it is the trap.
  `on_domain_start` activates a child by calling `initialize_child`,
  which resolves its source snapshot at the child's own start time
  (`nest_init._initial_snapshot`). That **cold-starts the nest from the
  raw analysis** valid at the free-forecast start. Every radar increment
  the cycling bought would live only in the parent and reach the nest
  through its lateral boundaries alone: strictly worse than the
  post-hoc interpolation this work replaces, because it also throws away
  the assimilation. There is no flag that makes the delayed start
  inherit the parent's live state.
- **`woof downscale` / offline child.** Inherits the parent's evolved
  state, but forces the child from archived *history* frames rather than
  every parent step, which is the specific weakness being avoided.

The route taken is the one the DA driver's own shape makes available.
`tools/da_cycle_prepared.py` rebuilds the entire model from scratch at
every leg and joins legs through the restart owner (`woof.io.restart`:
every trajectory writes its tree checkpoint set at a leg's end and the
next leg restores it before the analysis is applied), so **a leg is a
restarted model**, with every domain's clock placed by the checkpoint.
A nested leg is therefore not a mid-run introduction at all: it is an
ordinary two-domain model resumed at a leg boundary, whose parent state
at the start of that leg is the *analysed* state. On the leg a child is
born it is built from that parent by full SINT
(`nest_init.parent_only_init`), so it inherits every increment the
cycling produced, and is forced laterally by the parent every parent
step for the rest of the leg; on every later leg it is restored from the
trajectory's own set, and its birth is the activation epoch the
checkpoint header carries (`woof.da.nested_forecast.child_born_at`).
The sets are staged under `--stage-dir` (default `<out>/stage`), one
per trajectory per leg with the child inside it; a set is removed once
the next leg has restored it, and the run removes whatever the stage
still holds when it ends. A generation under `--save-ensemble` is the
copy that stays.

## What that costs, stated plainly

`parent_only_init` is the idealized `input_from_file=F` branch: it
returns `static_fields=None` and `soil=None`, and
`runtime.prepare_child_case` refuses a full-physics child without them.
The nowcast profile runs Noah, MM5 surface layer and YSU, so a land state
is mandatory. It is supplied by replicating the parent's land column onto
the child with WRF's own nest-down nearest-donor mapping
(`interp_fcni`/`interp_fcnm`), reusing the donor maps
`NestRegistration` already builds for SINT.

The consequence is a terrain and land policy identical to the one the
offline-child contract already registers as `sint-parent-inherited`:

> **The nest refines the atmosphere, not the surface.**

It buys finer dynamics, finer microphysics and a shorter acoustic step
over the analysed storm. It does not buy fine orography, because on this
route no fine static data exists to buy it with. Fine terrain needs a
per-domain prepared cache and the real-data child initialiser: a much
larger piece of work, and one that reopens the balance problem, because
real fine terrain under a SINT-inherited atmosphere is precisely the
mismatch WRF's `blend_terrain` / `adjust_tempqv` / `press_adj` sequence
exists to repair.

Keeping terrain, base state and land all inherited from the same parent
under the same operator is what makes the child's initial state
**balanced**, which is the whole point of the exercise.

Vertical resolution is shared tree-wide: a 1 km nest inherits the
parent's eta ladder. Often that, not `dx`, is what limits the result.

Stacking that ladder is not free, and it is not a choice you make on
its own. Halving a layer doubles the vertical Courant number
`w*dt/dz` of an updraft through it, and past 1 WRF's vertical-velocity
limiter pushes the w tendency against the motion where a run carries
`w_damping = 1` (`woof/core/dycore.py::apply_w_damping`; this tree's
own default is 0, `woof/config.py:113`, and the value comes from the
imported namelist): the run stays up and the updraft pays.  With the limiter off
the same crossing is a stability problem instead, not a safe one. On
one measured case a 15 s parent step over a band whose layers came out
198 m thick ran that number to 1.41, fired the limiter on 606 cells of
the parent domain and halved the peak updraft from 33.9 to 18.5 m/s;
the 49-level ladder the same case ran at 643 m layers and the same step
reached 0.79 and never fired. Price a ladder against the step it will
run before adopting it, and read the limiter line preflight prints.
Both are in [`da-nowcast-demo.md`](da-nowcast-demo.md) under **The three
findings that pick a cycle's configuration**.

## Admissibility is enforced, not conventional

`woof.da.nested_forecast.validate_nest_admissibility` refuses, rather
than advises:

| condition | outcome |
| --- | --- |
| `cu_physics != 0` below the convection-permitting spacing | refusal |
| column PBL below the gray-zone floor | refusal unless acknowledged |
| `spec_exp != 0` on a nested domain | refusal |
| `nested=False` or `specified=True` on the child | refusal |
| child `nz` differs from the parent's | refusal |
| child `mp_physics` differs from the parent's | refusal |

The two spacing thresholds are **imported** from
`woof.domain_wizard` rather than restated, so the two surfaces cannot
drift. They exist there only as advisories on the config-authoring path;
an advisory printed during authoring cannot police a domain this module
derives at runtime. Exactly 1.000 km does not trip the gray-zone floor:
it is a strict inequality, matching the wizard.

## One-way, and proved

`feedback` is pinned to 0 and is *not* inherited from the parent
experiment. The parent-inertness claim is a ratchet in the same spirit as
the N3/N4/N5 `ancestor_inertness` nest gates: the parent's whole
restart-serialised state is compared bit for bit with and without the
nest attached, and the comparison is paired with a liveness assertion so
it cannot pass by the nest quietly doing nothing.

Receipt: `evidence/da-nested-forecast/parent-inertness-receipt.json`
(dual-run, both runs identical; this box has no ECC).

## Cost

Nest work scales as (child columns / parent columns) × ratio, times the
number of nested trajectories. Against the shipped 132×132×49 3 km
nowcast with a measured 34.5 s parent leg over 11 trajectories:

The parent alone is **3499 MiB allocated, 6993 MiB machine peak
envelope**, and the nest is priced on top of that:

| half-width | child | Δ machine peak | control-only | all 11 trajectories |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 30 km | 60×60 | +194 MiB | +1.9 s/leg | +21.4 s/leg |
| 45 km | 90×90 | +246 MiB | +4.4 s/leg | +48.1 s/leg |
| 60 km | 120×120 | +317 MiB | +7.8 s/leg | +85.5 s/leg |
| 90 km | 180×180 | +838 MiB | +17.5 s/leg | +192.5 s/leg |

**These numbers moved with the nowcast's default physics profile.** They
were +59/+108/+176/+735 MiB on a 618 MiB / 3606 MiB parent while the
default was `wsm6-ysu-mm5-noah-no-radiation-v1`; the rows above were
measured with `thompson-mp8-ysu-mm5-noah-rrtmg-legacy-v1` bound
(`tools.da_nowcast.NOWCAST_DEFAULT_PHYSICS_PROFILE`, which
`tools/da_nest_cost.py` imports rather than restates), and mp8's extra
species plus two full radiation streams take the parent's binding
envelope from 3.5 GiB to 6.8 GiB. That constant moved to
`thompson-mp8-ysu-mm5-noah-rte-rrtmgp-v1` on 2026-09-19, the same suite
on the RTE+RRTMGP engines; these rows have not been re-measured under it
and name the suite they were measured with. On a 16 GiB card that is the difference between
comfort and a plan that does not fit, so **a VRAM plan measured before
this change has to be re-measured, not extrapolated.** Pass
`--physics-profile` to price any other shipped suite; the wall-time
columns are ratios against the measured parent leg and do not move with
the profile.

That is why `--nest-members` defaults to 0. A 60 km half-width 1 km nest
on the control alone adds about 23 % to a leg and about 300 MiB; the same
nest on the whole ensemble costs nine minutes over six free legs and the
nowcast starts to stop being a nowcast. The parent carries the ensemble;
the nest carries the detail.

VRAM here is **computed** by `woof.core.preflight`, not measured. The DA
driver hand-builds its `ExperimentState` and runs no VRAM gate of its
own; `tools/da_nest_cost.py` is the surface that fills that gap.

## Rendering

`tools/da_cycle_prepared.py` writes the nest's leg-end composite beside
the parent's, as `composites/legNN_<name>_dNN.npz`, carrying the
placement a renderer needs. The adoption line in
`tools/da_nowcast_render.py`:

```python
nest = nest_panel(cycle_dir, leg, name, gallery.lat, gallery.lon)
if nest is not None:
    ...pcolormesh(nest["lon"], nest["lat"], nest["refl_colmax"])...
```

`nest_panel` returns `None` for the legs the nest did not cover and for
any case rendered from a run that had no nest. Child geolocation is
derived from the parent's own lat/lon by inverting WRF's nest-down
pickup, so a panel cannot drift from the grid the model ran on. Draw the
nested panel **beside** the parent's, never instead of it: a fine view of
a forecast is only readable next to the forecast it refines.

## Not yet done

- No full nested nowcast has been run end to end. The driver path is
  wired and its pieces are individually proved on the GPU; a live-fire
  nested cycle is the next evidence to collect.
- Fine orography for the nest (see above) is a separate work item.
- The nest is not assimilated into. Observations constrain the parent;
  the nest inherits the analysis and forecasts from it.
