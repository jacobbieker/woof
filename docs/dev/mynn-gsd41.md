# MYNN generation gsd_41

`bl_mynn_version = "gsd_41"` selects the GSD MYNN v4.1 boundary layer of the
NOAA-EMC WRF 3.9 branch (NOAA-EMC/HRRR tag v4.1.21,
`sorc/hrrr_wrfarw.fd/WRFV3.9/phys/module_bl_mynn.F`, 6168 lines).  The
default, `wrf_461`, is WRF v4.6.1 `module_bl_mynn.F`.

## How it is built

The rows live in `woof/core/kernels/mynn_pbl.cu` behind
`#if defined(MYNN_GSD41)` and `#if !defined(MYNN_GSD41)`.  `gsd_41` compiles
the same file through the integer-define loader
(`woof.core.mynn_pbl_gpu.mynn_pbl_kernel`); the default build never sees a
gsd_41 line and compiles to the same binary as before the selector existed.
`tests/test_mynn_dmp_sibling.py` evaluates the conditionals as the default
build does before it compares the file with its DMP sibling.  The radiation
merge is `rla_mynn_gsd41` in `woof/core/kernels/rrtmg_legacy_adapter.cu`.

## Rows ported (audit rows of `HRRR-FORK-DIFF-AUDIT-2026-10-03/mynn-pbl-edmf.md`)

| Row | What | Check |
|---|---|---|
| P3 | A downward surface vapour flux is applied to the lowest layer (v4.1.21 :4408, :3114); v4.6.1 :4512-4516 deletes it. | Column test: the response relative to zero surface flux is symmetric for upward and downward forcing. P21 converts with updated vapour and the actual original mixing ratios. |
| P1 | Mixing length option 2, v4.1.21 :940-1085. | 12 columns against the branch's own Fortran: qkw exact, el within 2 ULP (libm). |
| P2, P12, P14 | Stratus subgrid cloud, its buoyancy functions and the 273.16..253 K phase blend, v4.1.21 :2293-2737, :6064-6162. In-cloud QC_BL, no QI_BL. | 8 columns, 240 levels against the branch's own Fortran: bit for bit. |
| P7 | Shallow-cumulus cloud for radiation, v4.1.21 :5767-5870. | Included in the full fork DMP oracle, with in-cloud water and the stratus hand-off. |
| P9 | Decay memory of the subgrid fraction, v4.1.21 :4690-4713. | Unit test of the hold, the clear and the water floor. |
| P8, A1 | Radiation merge, `module_radiation_driver.F` :1256-1303 of the branch. | Unit test of the phase split, the resolved-cloud gate and the fraction rule. |
| P15 | Surface TKE source: the surface layer's 1/L as handed in (not recomputed, not written back), z/L unclipped, Kansas-type forms, v4.1.21 :4412-4419. | Unit test against the formulas (at z/L = 10, pmz 41 where v4.6.1 goes negative). |
| P16 | PBL height reads theta-v of the liquid-water theta, the carried subgrid cloud standing in where no resolved cloud is present (v4.1.21 :4084-4096, :4236-4264); KPBL blends the two heights' rounded levels (:4948, :4980, :5006). The other consumers keep theta-v. | Unit tests of the input and the blend. |
| P17 | No sh floor, clip or sm cap; cloud floor 0.03 cldavg (v4.1.21 :1599-1635, :1820-1821). | mym_turbulence at level 2.5 with mixing length 2 against the branch's Fortran (5 columns, 70 interfaces): el, dfm, dfh, dfq, pdk, pdt, pdq, pdc, sh within 3 ULP. |
| P21 | Output water tendencies use the updated vapour denominator and original mixing ratios, v4.1.21 :3404, :3417, :3449. | All 144 source outputs are checked as FP32 bits under the explicit source cloud form. |
| P13, P22 | Explicit bl_mynn_cloud_tendency_form=gsd_41 takes the source pre-mixing condensate heat and tendency-only negative-condensate clip together. The wrf_461 default conserves water and uses mixed condensate. | Four liquid and ice columns, including negative forcing, match the unmodified source. This defect form is never selected by a recipe or importer default. |
| P20 | TKE has a zero-gradient top row, floor 1e-4 and no upper cap; initialization production uses qkemin 1e-12, v4.1.21 :203, :546, :2083-2094. | Eight columns and 96 TKE values match the unmodified predictor as FP32 bits, including each binding edge case. |
| P19 | Dissipative heating 0.5 q**3/(b1 l cp), held to 0..2e-5 K/s, no pressure taper, v4.1.21 :4600-4604. | Unit test against the formula, cap binding. |
| P14, P24 | Plume condensation uses the same 273.16..253 K saturation blend and the 2e-5 iteration stop, v4.1.21 :5933-5981. | 24 cold and warm plume states against the unmodified source's condensation_edmf: QC and THV bit for bit. |
| P4, P5, P6 | Ten 100 m plume classes, surface excess, resolved-motion taper, trigger, entrainment, overshoot and height damping, v4.1.21 :5107-5562. | 17 columns against unmodified DMP_mf, including every plume stopping at its first interface. |
| P10 | Scale awareness uses dx, not 2.5 dx, v4.1.21 :6011-6049. | Source check and coupled forecast cuts. |
| P11 | Density-free mass flux, local transport and surface forcing; no EDMF K floors, v4.1.21 :2044-2114, :2835-3114, :5633-5729. | Full plume oracle and eight clear transport columns. Ten-class workspace sizes are priced and allocated only for gsd_41. |

## Not ported yet (run the v4.6.1 form under either name)

- Closure 2.5 (P23).
- Cycled TKE and subgrid cloud (P18): the driver still refuses cycling and
  cold-starts.
- Mixing length option 1 under gsd_41 is the v4.6.1 option 1.

## The one defect-shaped line

v4.1.21 :995 converts the interface q to TKE as `0.5*qkw` where option 1 of
the same file and every later generation write `0.5*qkw**2`.  The default
takes the squared form; `bl_mynn_gsd41_unsquared_qtke = true` takes the line
as written.  Both are checked against the Fortran (the squared form against
the one line patched by `tools/mynn_pbl_gsd41_oracle/build.sh`).

## Oracle

`tools/mynn_pbl_gsd41_oracle/build.sh FORK_module_bl_mynn.F BUILD_DIR` builds
the unmodified branch source with GNU Fortran at -O0 and writes the CSVs in
`woof/data/mynn/oracle/` (`mixlength2-gsd41*.csv`, `condensation-gsd41.csv`,
`plume-condensation-gsd41.csv`;
hashes in `mixlength2-gsd41-provenance.txt`).

The mass-flux continuation adds `dmp-mf-gsd41.csv` and
`transport-gsd41.csv`, generated from the unmodified fork. The latter
compares the specific-humidity solve before the P21
conversion. The public HRRR products do not expose internal plume
occurrence; a diagnostic from published profiles is an estimate and is
labelled separately in the lane report.

## Configuration doors

The named hrrr_wrf.nl importer and the legacy MYNN budget key select gsd_41 and,
when radiation is not explicitly overridden, its required legacy RRTMG
merge. The native-spacing HRRR recipe selects the named composition
`thompson-mp28-mynn-gsd41-mynn-ruc-rrtmg-legacy-v1`. The full-grid recipe
`configs/recipes/hrrr_v4_gsd41.toml` sets both MYNN keys explicitly.
Generic defaults and all existing composition switch sets are unchanged.
The full raw namelist still needs support for its unrelated sections and
time-control keys; this lane does not silently discard them.

The TKE continuation adds `predict-gsd41.csv`, built from the unmodified
fork. The cloud transport fixture checks the paired P13/P22 defect form and
P21 output conversion. The source-defect form lacks the heat matching
mixed condensate and creates water when condensate is clipped; it requires
explicit bl_mynn_cloud_tendency_form=gsd_41, with wrf_461 the default.

The output conversion receives the actual original qv, qc and qi arrays
from the runtime. Direct gsd_41 leaf callers must supply those mixing
ratios as well as the specific arrays. At exactly unit updated specific
vapour the source denominator is zero; the defined fallback returns
zero water tendencies and keeps the original mixing ratios.
