# Certification

A run that finished is not a run that was checked. This document describes the
two commands that do the checking, the data they check against, and (as
importantly) what they refuse to do.

Both commands fail closed. Neither has a `--force`, a `--warn-only`, or a
tolerance flag. Where a check cannot be made, the answer is a refusal naming
the condition, not a pass with a caveat.

## `woof certify`

```bash
woof certify \
  --run-capsule out/<run>/certification-capsule.json \
  --metrics-csv out/<run>/metrics.csv \
  --band woof/data/certification/bands/<config-sha256>.json \
  --wrf-reference-manifest docs/public/wrf-reference/<config-sha256>.manifest.json \
  --out-verdict out/<run>/certification-verdict.json
```

It returns 0 only when every condition below holds, and nonzero naming each
that does not. All of them are evaluated on every invocation, so a reader gets
the whole list rather than the first refusal and a rerun.

| Condition | Refuses when |
|---|---|
| `capsule_validates` | the run capsule does not validate against `gpuwm.certification-capsule/v1` |
| `kernel_manifest_records_a_compiled_module` | the capsule's kernel manifest recorded nothing, so no compiled kernel witnesses the numbers it carries |
| `compile_platform_recorded` | the capsule cannot name the compiler that built it: the NVRTC build, its build id, the library digest, the driver, the device's compute capability, CuPy or NumPy went unmeasured |
| `compile_platform_matches_this_process` | the compile platform moved between the capsule and this process, **or** this process cannot witness it at all |
| `band_config_identity_matches_capsule` | the band's `config_sha256` is not the configuration the capsule records |
| `wrf_reference_hashes_present` | the WRF reference manifest is missing any of its four hash groups |
| `geography_input_hashed_by_content` | a declared directory input was bound by its listing (`sha256-directory-inventory`) rather than by its bytes |
| `every_pin_resolved` | a published environment pin carries a status other than `resolved` |
| `every_metrics_column_classified` | the metrics CSV carries a column the band's `metric_coverage` does not classify |
| `the_comparison_is_not_empty` | the run produced no metrics row, or the band gates none of the columns it did produce, so no comparison was made at all |
| `every_banded_row_inside_its_interval` | a gated comparison row falls strictly outside its own interval |

### The compile platform

Every acceptance gate stated in ULP is a measurement of *the compiled kernel*,
not of the source. On 2026-08-04 this project's kernel compiler changed
underneath a certified table with no tracked input moving (CuPy resolved a
different NVRTC out of `site-packages`) and a certified column moved with it.
So `certify` re-measures the compile platform and compares it, item for item,
against what the capsule recorded in its own pins.

Two fingerprints that measured *nothing* are equal, so agreement alone proves
nothing. The comparison is therefore only reported when both sides resolved
every item; otherwise the verdict's `drift` field is `null` (suppressed, not
empty) and the condition refuses. That is this document's own rule applied to
itself: where a check cannot be made, the answer is a refusal naming the
condition, not a pass with a caveat.

The practical consequence: **run `woof certify` on a process that can see the
CUDA/NVRTC stack**, normally the box that produced the capsule. Certifying an
archived capsule on a machine with no CUDA stack refuses
`compile_platform_matches_this_process`, naming what it could not measure and
what the capsule recorded. Nothing here needs a device to be *idle*: NVRTC
reports its build without one.

The verdict binds the whole `compile_platform` block (both fingerprints, the
drift list, and whether a comparison was possible at all) so a reader
recomputes the answer rather than trusting the label, and the `PASS` line
names the NVRTC build it witnessed.

`every_metrics_column_classified` and `every_banded_row_inside_its_interval`
are the ones that catch drift rather than mistakes. A comparator column added
later is not silently ignored: it is an unclassified column, and certification
stops until somebody decides whether it is gated or merely recorded.

`the_comparison_is_not_empty` is the floor under the whole table. Every other
row condition is a statement about all rows, and a statement about all rows is
true of no rows: a metrics CSV carrying its header and nothing else therefore
certified as `PASS (0 banded comparisons)` and exited 0, as did one whose rows
the band gated no column of. One row and one banded comparison are required,
not full coverage of the band: a run legitimately shorter than the band's
longest lead produces fewer rows than the band has cells, and refusing that
would be a guard firing on the ordinary case. The passing line prints the
count (`certify: PASS (210 banded comparisons, ...)`) so a comparison that is
technically non-empty and actually thin stays visible rather than reading the
same as a full one.

The verdict document records which condition set it was written against in
`verdict_schema_version`; `woof.certify.verdict.CONDITIONS_BY_SCHEMA_VERSION`
carries the older sets, so an independent verifier rederiving a verdict from
an earlier release gets that verdict's own answer rather than a bare refusal.
A version this code does not know fails closed and says so. Reading an older
set does not reopen what it was missing: the minimum-comparison floor is
enforced on rederivation for every version, including the ones whose condition
list predates it.

## The acceptance band

The band is data, not code. One file per configuration, addressed by that
configuration's SHA-256, under `woof/data/certification/bands/`. Nothing in
it names a case; two configurations that differ by one byte get two files, and
a band cannot drift onto a configuration it was not derived for.

Each band declares:

- a **provenance**, either `documented-margin` or `wrf-ensemble-envelope`;
- a **band schema version**, which the verdict records alongside the
  provenance it certified against;
- a **`metric_coverage` map** with exactly one entry per comparator metric
  column, each classified `banded` or `recorded-only`;
- an **interval** per (domain, lead, gated metric), or an explicit
  `nan_expected` marker where the comparison has no defined value.

### Today's provenance: `documented-margin`

The interim band's intervals are the deterministic output of a committed rule,
`published-anchor-margin`, applied to committed inputs. The rule
(`woof/data/certification/margin_rule.json`) takes the published comparison
table as its anchor and opens a documented margin around each cell: an
absolute floor per metric family, or a relative fraction of the anchor,
whichever is larger, clamped to that family's physical range.

**The rule is the artifact; the numbers are its output.** Re-running the
derivation on an unchanged tree reproduces the committed band byte for byte,
and a test asserts exactly that, so a band edited by hand is caught by the
tool that made it. The band also records the SHA-256 of the published table it
anchored on, so editing that table makes the band visibly stale rather than
quietly wrong.

Beside each band is a **coverage receipt** recording, for every
(domain, lead, metric) triple of the published table, whether the published
value lies inside its own interval, outside it, or is a non-number against a
cell that expects one. The receipt is an observation. No test asserts a
distribution over it, and none should: a band widened until it swallowed the
whole table would satisfy such an assertion and prove nothing.

### Tomorrow's provenance: `wrf-ensemble-envelope`

When the WRF control ensemble lands, the same file and the same command carry
intervals derived from the ensemble spread instead of from a documented
margin. Such a band additionally carries an `ensemble` block (member count,
per-member configuration digests, the pair-score artifact digest, and the
interval statistic) labelled `scope: internal`. Those artifacts are
internal-scope: they are not part of any release, and this repository offers no
route to them. What is public is the interval they produced and the statistic
that produced it.

## `woof dual-run`

```bash
woof dual-run --capsule-a out/run-a/certification-capsule.json \
               --capsule-b out/run-b/certification-capsule.json
```

Two capsules from what should be the same run, compared leaf for leaf, in a
deterministic path order that is a property of the two documents rather than
of dictionary iteration. Three outcomes:

| Exit | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | identical, with the size of the screen attached: `dual-run: capsules are identical field for field (71 compared quantities)` |
| 1 | they disagree, naming the first field they disagree on |
| 2 | there was nothing to compare, or an arm could not be read |

The third is not a formality. Handed two empty capsules (`{}` and `{}`) this
command used to print `identical field for field` and exit 0: the comparison
is total by construction, so it found no divergence, because there was no
field. "No divergence was found" and "no divergence could have been found" are
different answers, and this is the only detector the project has for the
silent memory corruption a card without ECC cannot report. A capsule that is
zero bytes, empty, or carries no leaf between the two arms is now refused by
arm and by name, with the byte count, and told which file to point at instead.
A real capsule against an empty one remains a *divergence*, not a refusal.

The count on the success line is there for the same reason: "identical" is the
same sentence over one quantity and over a hundred. `--out-report` records it
as `compared_count`, and the obs battery's `determinism` control carries it on
every dual-run row it reports.

Nothing is skipped, because every field a comparison skips is a field a
silent bit flip can hide in. A field that is absent and a field that is
present carrying `null` are different claims and compare unequal; a section
emptied of its contents does not vanish from the comparison.

Two fields are compared after **normalization** rather than literally, and
they are the ones that record *where* a run wrote rather than what it
computed: `output.frames[i].path` and `receipts.<name>.path` are compared by
their leaf name. Two runs of one configuration must write to different
directories or they overwrite each other (the procedure above says so, with
`out/run-a` and `out/run-b`) so comparing the absolute paths literally made
a clean verdict unreachable for every pair, whatever the physics did. The
leaf name is still compared: a run that wrote the wrong domain, the wrong
valid time or a different number of frames still diverges, and a dropped
path is still a hole rather than a matching basename. Every byte that
carries physics (each frame's SHA-256 and size, the trajectory digest, the
pins, the kernel manifest, the input-artifact bytes) is compared verbatim.
Input paths are *not* normalized: two runs of one configuration read the
same file, so a difference there is a real finding.

**Both arms must share one preparation.** `numerical_stack.
input_artifact_bytes` witnesses which input bytes each arm read and is
compared verbatim, which is exactly what a swapped or corrupted input trips.
A preparation receipt records its own wall-clock timings and the staging
directory its decoder used, so two independent preparations of one
configuration never produce the same bytes and two independently prepared
arms can never agree. Prepare once; run the forecast twice from that one
prepared root. When a divergence does land on an input-bytes field,
`dual-run` says so and names this as the usual cause.

This is also the detector for hardware that cannot report its own errors: on a
card without ECC, running the same configuration twice and comparing the
receipts is the screen.

## The verdict, and why flipping it does nothing

The verdict document carries `capsule_binding_sha256`, a SHA-256 over the
closed inventory of everything the decision rests on: the capsule digest, the
band and its derivation, the WRF reference binding, the metrics digest and
column list, every evaluated condition, and every bound comparison row.

The `passed` boolean is deliberately **not** in that inventory. Flipping it,
or deleting it, moves neither the binding digest nor the verdict re-derived
from the bound rows. Editing any bound row moves both. A consumer therefore
never has to trust the claimed bit: it recomputes the digest, re-derives the
decision from the rows, and compares.

Nothing under `woof/certify/` imports any case module, and a test holds the
import graph to that. A certification path that ran through a case module would
be a certification path that could not certify a second case.

## WRF reference manifests

See [wrf-reference/README.md](wrf-reference/README.md). A manifest pins the
executable, the build recipe, the namelists, and the reference output bytes the
matched comparison was made against. Certification refuses while any of those
is absent, not because a missing hash is likely to be wrong, but because a
verdict that did not know what it was compared against is not a verdict.

## What certification does not claim

- It does not claim the model is correct. It claims a specific run, on a
  specific configuration, on a stated stack, produced a comparison that falls
  inside a stated interval derived by a stated rule.
- It does not claim the interval is the right one. Under
  `documented-margin` the interval is a documented margin around a published
  comparison, and it says so in its own provenance field.
- It does not measure accuracy against observations. Under `documented-margin`,
  a PASS means that the run reproduced a historical WOOF-versus-WRF comparison
  within a documented margin. This is a code-verification regression check,
  not evidence of statistical indistinguishability: the margin is not calibrated
  from WRF ensemble spread. The v4.7.1 ensemble studies described in
  [VERIFICATION.md](VERIFICATION.md) are separate evidence; they do not supply
  this band's intervals or confer an observation-based accuracy claim.
- It does not claim reproducibility across hardware. The environment pins
  exist precisely because byte identity is a claim about a fixed stack; see
  [DETERMINISM.md](DETERMINISM.md).
