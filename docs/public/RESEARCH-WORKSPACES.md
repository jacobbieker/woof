# Research workspaces

WOOF's research catalog organizes 12 weather families into 23 submodes, 38 research questions and 114 recommended experiment configurations. Each final question has three distinct starting configurations; every family and submode also names at least three starting recommendations. The machine-readable authority is `woof/data/tui/research-workspaces.json`.

These are **development recommendations**. Every configuration is initially `unvalidated`. A recommendation becomes qualified only through execution evidence tied to its catalog identity, source revision, actual configuration, inputs and hardware. Existing release receipts do not validate this catalog.

## Reading a recommendation

Start with the physical question, then choose the method. The catalog's resolution, duration, cadence and minimum root span are proposed experiment settings. They are design hypotheses, not literature-derived accuracy thresholds. Native sizing must show the resulting geometry and resource use; a fit that sacrifices the required domain or changes the question must be made explicit.

- **Regional:** an economical reference retaining larger-scale context.
- **Nested:** a live child or hierarchy receives the evolving parent forcing; compare its actual terrain, fields and event timing with the parent.
- **Archived downscale:** replay a selected interval from an existing parent archive. Parent production, archive storage and child preparation remain part of the cost.
- **Moving nest:** retain a fixed-size child around a supported pressure/height, UH, reflectivity or native model-attribute signal within a prepared corridor.
- **Controlled scenario:** compare an explicit supported initial-state change with a fresh unchanged control using identical forcing and physics.

The five hardware classes (8, 12, 16, 24 and 32 GiB) are resource choices separate from these scientific questions. A selected class is not measured free memory or a fit guarantee. Native resource checks must use the actual device, free-memory headroom and host-memory budget. Restricted-budget tests must be labelled as such. This catalog contains no physical-card qualification results.

## Methods and their limits

The packaged diagnostic capabilities in `woof/data/tui/research-diagnostics.json` describe a reviewed subset of the WOOF history-import path, so creating a research TOML does not require a built plotting executable. Actual plotting still uses the native renderer and checks saved fields and complete time windows. Each setup names additional analysis when the available charts do not directly calculate its requested quantity. Plain-temperature lapse-rate browse fields are explicitly distinct from the virtual-temperature products.

The hail questions separate growth-supporting storm conditions from the subsequent melting environment. Their diagnostics are proxies: this catalog has no hail-diameter or hail-trajectory product. [NOAA NSSL's hail overview](https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/hail/forecasting/) motivates that separation. Rotation comparisons follow the established use of buoyancy and shear in storm-structure experiments; kilometer-scale UH remains a rotating-updraft diagnostic, not a tornado prediction. [Weisman and Klemp (1982)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/110/6/1520-0493_1982_110_0504_tdonsc_2_0_co_2.xml), [Bryan, Wyngaard and Fritsch (2003)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/131/10/1520-0493_2003_131_2394_rrftso_2.0.co_2.xml).

Derecho research retains a whole-system corridor as a separate option from detailed study of one bowing segment. A bow echo or resolved 10 m wind maximum alone does not establish a derecho. [Corfidi et al. (2016)](https://training.weather.gov/wdtd/courses/woc/severe/storm-structures-hazards/winds/derechos/story_content/external_files/Corfidi2016.pdf). Tropical work similarly separates track, pressure/wind evolution, rainbands and landfall, reflecting distinct sampling questions in hurricane research. [NOAA AOML modeling](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hurricane-modeling-prediction/), [Hurricane Field Program](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/1_2023HFP_Introduction.pdf).

Archived downscaling requires a continuous parent series and companion physics evidence: a woof restart or the supported stock-WRF namelist route. Plan parent history at 15 minutes or denser; fast evolving comparisons in this catalog prefer five-minute parent history when available. The boundary-cadence ceiling is an explicit choice. Dense output cannot recover changes that were never archived. Repeating refinement stages cannot reconstruct missing source information, and finite-cadence forcing may shift convective initiation relative to a live child. Exact child-grid surface fields can supply finer land-use, lake and coastline identity; terrain remains inherited from the parent. [Native downscale contract and cadence evidence](DOWNSCALE.md).

Tile streaming can reduce resident GPU demand by moving a domain through host memory. It still needs host capacity and incurs transfer/runtime cost. Compact children reduce covered area; moving children require a prepared corridor; sequential archived children reduce concurrent grids while adding stages, storage and inherited-boundary limits. None of these options makes an arbitrary region, finest grid or stage count free. [Native tile-streaming contract](TILES.md).


| Signal | Catalog starting value | Meaning and constraint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pressure/height | 850 hPa; 20 m height depth | Height depression on a pressure surface. Sea-level pressure uses `level_hpa = 0` and a separately chosen absolute hPa ceiling. |
| Updraft helicity | 50 m²/s²; 25 dBZ fallback | Requires the reflectivity fallback before rotation develops; a fix can switch between cells. |
| Reflectivity | 35 dBZ | Follows a selected echo region, not a gust front, hailstone, rain maximum or derecho identity. |
| Native model attribute | Explicit case-reviewed threshold; no catalog default | `theta`: total potential temperature in K; `qv`, `qc`, `qr`: vapor, cloud-water and rain-water mixing ratios in kg/kg of dry air; `w`: vertical velocity in m/s, averaged from adjacent faces to mass levels. |

Attribute following selects `max` or `min`, then `column_max`, `column_min`, `column_mean` or `model_level`. The column mean is an unweighted mean over model levels. A model-level selection requires an explicit zero-based mass-level index valid on the source domain; it is not a fixed pressure or height surface. Moisture attributes require a moist source. Columns with non-finite selected values are excluded. Potential temperature is distinct from air temperature, and water-vapor mixing ratio is distinct from relative humidity. These native values establish no additional hazard diagnosis. [Native attribute registry and reduction implementation](../../woof/core/attribute_tracking.py).

All proposed moving configurations use 300 s evaluation/history intent. Native clock and signal availability must accept the actual cadence. Review search margin, shifts, overlap, cooldown and track-fix evidence. Dormant nests still reserve resources.


## Catalog

The tables show scientific intent, not a hardware-sized grid. `12 → 4 → 1.33 km` describes the proposed hierarchy. For archived configurations it describes the intended parent-to-child spacing; the actual archive determines the eligible parent. Root-span minima are planning constraints and must be enlarged for the selected weather case. Output cadence is history cadence, not the dynamical time step.

Measure differences between adjacent resolved terrain, land or coastal areas.
Physical context: [Prevailing Winds: Flight Environment](https://www.weather.gov/source/zhu/ZHU_Training_Page/winds/Wx_Terms/Flight_Environment.htm).

Relate buoyancy, shear and storm persistence to conditions that can support hail growth aloft.
Physical context: [Severe Weather 101: Hail Forecasting](https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/hail/forecasting/); [Resolution Requirements for the Simulation of Deep Moist Convection (2003)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/131/10/1520-0493_2003_131_2394_rrftso_2.0.co_2.xml).

Inputs: Choose a convectively active case; retain full thermodynamic and hydrometeor history for any separate growth-layer analysis.
Limit: These are environmental and storm-structure proxies; this catalog does not calculate hail diameter, trajectories or verified hail at the ground.

Additional analysis required:

- The stored 700-500 hPa lapse-rate plot uses plain temperature. It is not the virtual-temperature lapse rate; the virtual-temperature quantity requires separate analysis.

#### Hail melting & survival · `hail-survival`

Separate hail-favorable storm structure aloft from the thermodynamic path toward the surface.
Physical context: [Severe Weather 101: Hail Forecasting](https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/hail/forecasting/).

| Configuration | Method and sampling intent | Research comparison |

**Supercell rotation.** Study persistent rotating updrafts and their storm-relative environment.
Submode starts: `rotation.environment`, `rotation.structure`, `rotation.follow`.

Additional analysis required:

- The stored 700-500 hPa lapse-rate plot uses plain temperature. It is not the virtual-temperature lapse rate; the virtual-temperature quantity requires separate analysis.

#### Supercell rotation · `rotation`

Study storm-relative environment and persistent modeled rotating updrafts.
Physical context: [The Dependence of Numerically Simulated Convective Storms on Vertical Wind Shear and Buoyancy (1982)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/110/6/1520-0493_1982_110_0504_tdonsc_2_0_co_2.xml); [Resolution Requirements for the Simulation of Deep Moist Convection (2003)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/131/10/1520-0493_2003_131_2394_rrftso_2.0.co_2.xml).

| Configuration | Method and sampling intent | Research comparison |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Shear and buoyancy context**<br>`rotation.environment` | Live nested; 12 → 4 km; 6 h; history 15 min | Which pre-storm environments accompany persistent modeled rotation? Compare environment before convection rather than sampling only storm-modified air. |
| **Fixed fine structure**<br>`rotation.structure` | Live nested; 12 → 4 → 1.33 km; 3 h; history 5 min | How do UH duration and echo organization change in a finer live child? Compare fixed-domain UH paths and echo morphology with the coarser parent. |
| **Follow the rotating updraft**<br>`rotation.follow` | Moving child; 12 → 4 → 1.33 km; 6 h; history 5 min | Can a UH follower keep the rotating updraft and inflow within the child? Compare track fixes, fallback periods and UH paths against a fixed child. |

| Configuration | Method and sampling intent | Research comparison |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Boundary and inhibition**<br>`convective-initiation.boundary` | Live nested; 12 → 4 km; 6 h; history 5 min | Where do moisture convergence proxies and weakening inhibition precede echoes? Compare the boundary evolution and first echo times across the area. |
| **Live initiation child**<br>`convective-initiation.fine` | Live nested; 12 → 4 → 1.33 km; 3 h; history 5 min | Does the initiation timing or location shift when a finer child starts before initiation? Compare first sustained echoes using identical thresholds and valid times. |

Diagnostics: `mlcape`, `mlcin`, `2m_dewpoint_10m_winds`, `composite_reflectivity`, `bulk_shear_0_6km`.
Inputs: Start before the observed initiation window and preserve an unchanged-source control.
Limit: Subgrid triggers and source errors can dominate initiation; a warm bubble is a separate explicit scenario, never an automatic correction.

#### Derecho & bowing systems · `derecho`

Study the persistence and propagation of an organized convective wind system over its full corridor.
Physical context: [A Proposed Revision to the Definition of Derecho (2016)](https://training.weather.gov/wdtd/courses/woc/severe/storm-structures-hazards/winds/derechos/story_content/external_files/Corfidi2016.pdf); [Severe Weather 101: Thunderstorm Basics](https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/thunderstorms/).

| --- | --- | --- |
| **Whole-system corridor**<br>`derecho.corridor` | Live nested; 12 → 4 km; 12 h; history 5 min | How does the line organize and maintain its wind swath across the regional corridor? Compare propagation, echo organization and the continuity of resolved 10 m wind-snapshot maxima over the entire run. |
| **Bowing-segment detail**<br>`derecho.segment` | Live nested; 12 → 4 → 1.33 km; 3 h; history 5 min | What changes near one bow apex while the live parent retains the larger cold pool? Compare the segment against the full-system reference; retain environmental inflow. |
| **Follow an echo segment**<br>`derecho.follow` | Moving child; 12 → 4 → 1.33 km; 6 h; history 5 min | Can an echo-following child retain the selected bow segment during propagation? Inspect track switches and child clipping against a fixed regional reference. |

Coverage: proposed root minimum 800 km in both horizontal directions. Plan roughly 800–1500 km along the event path when the case requires it, with inflow and lateral clearance; a smaller domain must narrow the research question.
Diagnostics: `composite_reflectivity`, `10m_wind_run_max`, `mslp_10m_winds`, `2m_dewpoint`, `700mb_rh_height_winds`, `bulk_shear_0_6km`.
Inputs: Choose an observed organized-wind case and retain the storm report/analysis reference separately.
Limit: A modeled bow or gust swath does not establish a derecho; a compact child cannot represent the entire system lifetime.

Additional analysis required:

- The wind maximum uses stored 10 m wind snapshots. It is not a gust diagnostic; gust magnitude or a gust swath requires separate analysis or observations.
- The current WOOF history renderer does not produce DCAPE. Moisture and temperature context cannot establish downdraft energy; that parcel calculation requires separate analysis.

### Hurricanes & tropical weather

Study an existing cyclone's track, pressure/wind evolution, rainbands and landfall environment.

Family starts: `tropical-track.steering`, Broad steering reference; `tropical-intensity.evolution`, Pressure-wind baseline; `tropical-rainbands.envelope`, Rainband envelope.

**Vortex evolution.** Track and intensity are related but require different coverage and sampling.
Submode starts: `tropical-track.steering`, `tropical-intensity.evolution`, `tropical-track.fixed`.

#### Track & steering · `tropical-track`

Compare a source cyclone's motion with the evolving surrounding flow.

Diagnostics: `mslp_10m_winds`, `850mb_height_winds`, `500mb_height_winds`, `200mb_height_winds`.
Inputs: The source or supplied scenario must already contain the cyclone; retain an independent track reference for retrospective study.

#### Pressure & wind evolution · `tropical-intensity`

Study how modeled central pressure, surface wind and convective structure change together.
Physical context: [Hurricane Modeling and Prediction Program](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hurricane-modeling-prediction/); [2023 Hurricane Field Program: Introduction](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/1_2023HFP_Introduction.pdf).

Coverage: proposed root minimum 800 km in both horizontal directions. Cover the rainband arc and its moisture supply, including land if accumulation there is the question.
Diagnostics: `composite_reflectivity`, `qpf_1h`, `qpf_6h`, `precipitable_water`, `700mb_rh_height_winds`, `bulk_shear_0_6km`.

| **Coastal archived replay**<br>`tropical-landfall.replay` | Archived child; 4 → 1.33 km; 6 h; history 5 min | Does the replay preserve coast-crossing timing while altering local extremes? Use an exact child-grid surface file and compare area/track displacement. |

Coverage: proposed root minimum 1000 km in both horizontal directions. Cover offshore approach, the coast and inland path, including terrain that can modify rainfall.
Diagnostics: `mslp_10m_winds`, `10m_wind_run_max`, `10m_wind_speed_and_direction`, `qpf_1h`, `total_qpf`, `2m_temperature`.
Inputs: Use valid land/sea masks and surface state; start before coast crossing and include the post-landfall interval.
Limit: This atmosphere-only configuration does not calculate storm surge, tides, waves, inundation or building-level winds.

Additional analysis required:

- The wind maximum uses stored 10 m wind snapshots. It is not a gust diagnostic; gust magnitude or a gust swath requires separate analysis or observations.

### Scenario & hurricane lab

Family starts: `scenario-convection.gentle`, 1 K thermal perturbation; `scenario-tropical-input.source`, Supplied-source baseline; `scenario-convection.stronger`, 2 K amplitude comparison.

## Outputs and qualification

All listed diagnostic identifiers exist in the native plot catalog. Required history inputs and time windows remain mandatory. A preset requests products; it does not enable physics, create missing variables, infer a missing 24-hour window or guarantee a useful scientific result. Some listed diagnostics supplement the family plot preset and should be retained in the reviewed plot selection. [Native plot data](../../woof/data/tui/plot-presets.json), [output-variable contract](OUTPUT-VARIABLES.md).

The separate validation matrix must identify every configuration by ID and record creation, preserved settings, review, preparation, forecast, diagnostics, restart/resume and the method-specific checks that apply. A failed or unrun recommendation remains visible and unqualified. For paired experiments, retain both the control and treatment receipts. Record actual device/driver/OS/free-memory conditions, distinguishing native hardware runs from restricted-budget tests and estimates.

Sources were checked on 2026-09-06. External primary sources motivate the physical questions; native source files establish the admitted features. The selected geometry, cadence and comparison plans are this catalog's research proposals.

Additional analysis required:

- Low cloud cover and near-surface humidity describe the fog environment, not visibility distance. Visibility and verified fog boundaries require separate analysis or observations.
