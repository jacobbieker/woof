# Sub-grid terrain drag

These optional WRF v4.7.1 schemes use terrain statistics below the model
grid scale. Both selectors default to 0. Turning them on changes the
forecast; column agreement with WRF does not establish forecast skill.

| Selector | Values | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `topo_wind` | 0 off, 1, 2 | Corrects YSU surface momentum drag and 10 m wind using terrain variance and terrain curvature. Option 1 uses `VAR_SSO`; option 2 uses `VAR`. Requires `bl_pbl_physics = 1`. |
| `gwd_opt` | 0 off, 1, 3 | Adds orographic drag after the PBL scheme at its cadence. Option 1 provides gravity-wave drag and blocking; option 3 provides large-scale gravity-wave drag, blocking, small-scale gravity-wave drag and turbulent orographic form drag. Requires an active PBL scheme. |

GSL components taper with grid spacing as in WRF. Its large-scale drag
vanishes at 3 km and its small-scale wave and form drag vanish at 1 km.
The port uses WRF's default `gsl_diss_ht_opt = 0`, with no dissipative
heating. `gwd_opt = 2` is unavailable.

With SASE, GSL uses SASE's bulk-Richardson PBL height and its corresponding
upper-bracket level. This BL definition differs from a WRF PBL package.
The diagnostic supplies drag locally and leaves the surface-layer PBL
height and top-level carriers unchanged.

Select an option before preparing the run so the static builder includes
its fields. For example, in the experiment TOML:

```toml
[shared]
bl_pbl_physics = 1
sf_sfclay_physics = 1
topo_wind = 1
gwd_opt = 0
```

The GEOG root must contain the selected WPS datasets:

| Option | Default dataset | Produced fields |
|---|---|---|
| `topo_wind = 1` | `varsso_10m` | `VAR_SSO` |
| `topo_wind = 2` | `orogwd_10m/var` | `VAR` |
| `gwd_opt = 1` | `orogwd_10m` | `VAR`, `CON`, `OA1` to `OA4`, `OL1` to `OL4` |
| `gwd_opt = 3` | `orogwd3_10m` | `VAR`, `CON`, `OA1` to `OA4`, `OL1` to `OL4`, each with `LS` and `SS` suffixes |

Unpack the WPS orographic datasets beneath the same GEOG root used for
terrain and land use. `geog_data_res` in `namelist.wps` selects the WPS
table's resolution alternatives. Missing requested fields stop preparation
with the dataset name; they are never replaced with zero drag.

```sh
woof prep --source SOURCE --input-list inputs.txt \
  --experiment-config experiment.toml --wps-namelist namelist.wps \
  --geog-root WPS_GEOG --output-root prep
woof sim prep --experiment-config experiment.toml \
  --wps-namelist namelist.wps --outdir forecast
```

Replace `SOURCE` with the forcing source and include its required
supplementary inputs, as for a run without terrain drag.

The current routes support a prepared resident root domain, a root split
across cards through `[devices]`, a streamed `[tiles]` root, and a separate
downscale of saved history on its own geography. Each tile receives its
static fields with the same halo and edge mapping as its initial state.
Topographic wind curvature uses the neighboring domain terrain across
stored row slabs. The downscale builds the
requested statistics from WPS_GEOG and passes them to child physics.
Parent-terrain downscales and children inside a running domain tree are
refused because those initializers do not supply the required statistics.
`topo_wind` with BEP or BEP+BEM is refused because
that YSU arm does not contain the surface momentum term it would scale.

Static-field and halo delivery to device ranks is covered by
