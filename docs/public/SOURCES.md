# Sources at the domain wizard

`woof domain` plans a domain FOR a source. The source decides three
things about the file it emits: the boundary cadence written into the
companion `namelist.wps`, whether the domain has to sit inside a regional
grid, and how far into a forecast the window may reach. All three are
declared in that source's row in the source registry
(`woof/source_adapters.py`), so the wizard reads them rather than
carrying its own table -- and a source added to the registry reaches this
door with no change to the wizard.

List the whole registry with `woof prep --list-sources`, or one row with
`woof prep --show-source <id>`.

## What the wizard plans for today

`--source` takes any registered id or any of its aliases.

| source | aliases | boundary cadence | forecast horizon | native grid |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `hrrr` | -- | 1 h | f048 | 1799x1059 Lambert at 3 km (CONUS) |
| `hrrr-prs` | `hrrr-pressure`, `hrrr-wrfprs` | 1 h | f048 | 1799x1059 Lambert at 3 km (CONUS) |
| `gem-gdps` | `gem`, `gdps`, `gem-global` | 3 h | f240 | global |
| `icon-global` | `icon`, `icon-13km`, `dwd-icon`, `dwd-icon-global` | 3 h | f180 (00/12Z), f120 (06/18Z) | global, 2,949,120-cell icosahedral mesh at nominally 13 km |
| `icon-eu` | `dwd-icon-eu`, `icon-eu-regular` | 1 h | f120 | lat 29.5..70.5, lon -23.5..62.5 |
| `icon-d2` | `icon-2km`, `dwd-icon-d2` | 1 h | f048 | lat 44.0..57.3, lon 0.0..17.3, 542,040-cell icosahedral mesh at nominally 2.2 km |
| `gfs` | `gfs-0p25`, `gfs-0.25` | 3 h | f384 | global |
| `gdas` | `gdas-0p25`, `gdas-0.25` | 1 h | f009 | global |
| `gefs` | `gefs-ensemble` | 3 h | f384 | global |
| `aigfs` | `ai-gfs` | 6 h | f384 | global |
| `aigefs` | `ai-gefs` | 6 h | f384 | global |
| `ecmwf-open-data` | `ecmwf`, `ifs` | 3 h | f360 | global |
| `aifs` | `aifs-v2`, `aifs-single` | 6 h | f360 | global |
| `rap` | `rap-awip32` | 1 h | f051 | AWIPS 221, 349x277 Lambert at 32 km (North America) |
| `rrfs` | `rrfs-ops` | 1 h | f084 | 1799x1059 Lambert at 3 km (CONUS; HRRR's grid, measured identical) |
| `era5` | -- | 6 h | analysis only | global |
| `era5-l137` | `era5-model-level`, `era5-ml` | 1 h | analysis only | global |
| `20crv3` | `20cr`, `twentycrv3`, `20crv3-member` | 3 h | analysis only | global |
| `20crv3-cf` | `20crv3-netcdf`, `20cr-netcdf`, `20cr-cf` | 3 h | analysis only | global |

The boundary cadence column is the default. `--cadence N` writes a coarser
one when the source's preparation takes it: `gdas`, `icon-eu`, `gefs`,
`ecmwf-open-data` and `gem-gdps` take any whole multiple of the cadence
above, so `woof domain --source gdas --hours 9 --cadence 3` writes
`interval_seconds = 10800` and prepares from f000, f003, f006 and f009.
A cadence the preparation does not take is refused by `woof domain`,
`woof fetch` and the `[fetch]` table check before anything is downloaded,
naming the spacing the preparation takes.

A registered source that is NOT in this list refuses by name and says why:
either its row has no runnable initialization route yet, or its boundary
cadence is not a property of the source at all (`--source mapped` reads it
from the mapping document a caller supplies).

## Regional sources are bounded at plan time

Where a row declares a native grid, the wizard bounds the fitted ladder by
it and refuses a domain that cannot be reached -- before anything is
downloaded. The refusal names the offending point, where that point lands
in the source's OWN index space, and the window the source covers:

```
$ woof domain --point=38.5,-97.5 --card 16gb --root-dx 3 --hours 6 \
      --source icon-eu --cycle 2026-08-17T00 --out kansas.toml
woof domain: ladder 3 cannot be forced by icon-eu even at the minimum
layout (60x48 root): the 60x48 root's point at lat/lon (37.8377, -98.5408)
maps to source index x=-1200.652 y=133.404, and the source covers
x=0..1376 (lon -23.5..62.5) y=0..656 (lat 29.5..70.5); 2989 of 2989 root
mass points are outside it.  icon-eu's grid is centred at (50.00, 19.50)
-- move --point inside that grid, shrink the ladder, or choose a source
whose coverage includes this domain
```

(Verbatim, `woof 2.5.0`, exit 2, nothing written.)

That is the same answer the preparation stage gives on real bytes, in the
same coordinates, arrived at from the registry instead of from a download.
The 2026-08-17 model battery paid a full ICON-EU acquisition and 73
seconds of preprocessing to learn it, and read it as a traceback.

Where the domain fits but the *margined* fetch box overruns the grid, the
box is clamped into coverage and the clamp is reported as an advisory --
`--area` is a coverage check for a regional source, not a crop.

HRRR keeps its own, stricter check: its certified route needs real source
cells outside the target on every side for the interpolation stencil, the
surface-fallback halo and the donor search, so it refuses domains that the
bare grid rectangle would accept.

## Which sources `woof fetch` downloads

Every row in the table above except `era5-l137`, `20crv3` and
`20crv3-cf` (see "Sources with no fetch door" below). Twelve of them are
rows in the packaged acquisition-route document
(`woof/authorities/rw-wps-fetch-routes.v1.json`), read by the one engine
in `woof/fetch_routes.py`; four keep the hand-written transports that
predate it. `docs/public/DATA.md` publishes the working command for each.

| how the bytes arrive | sources |
|---|---|
| table route (whole published objects, in parallel) | `hrrr-prs`, `rap`, `rrfs`, `gefs`, `aigfs`, `aigefs`, `ecmwf-open-data`, `aifs`, `icon-global`, `icon-eu`, `icon-d2`, `gem-gdps` |
| hand-written transport (publisher-side subsetting) | `gfs`, `gdas` (NOMADS grib-filter or the S3 archive), `hrrr` (`.idx` byte ranges, live-cycle wait), `era5` (the public ARCO Zarr store with no key, or a Copernicus CDS retrieval under your own key) |

`woof domain` emits the `[fetch]` table and the runnable step 1 for every
one of them, because the wizard asks the fetch module the question rather
than carrying a list:

```
next:
  1. woof fetch --source rap --cycle 2026-08-17T00 --hours 6 --out .../data/area_38p50n_97p50w
```

**`--area` is only for the four.** A table route takes whole published
objects -- there is no subsetting service in front of them -- so the
emitted `[fetch]` table carries no crop key for one, and passing `--area`
to it refuses by name. The crop for those sources happens at `woof prep`,
where the namelist geometry is the crop. The wizard's coverage advisories
still print: they are a statement about whether the source reaches your
domain, which is a different question from how many bytes come down.

## Sources with no fetch door

Four runnable rows refuse a download by name, and the refusal states the
breakage rather than reporting a gap:

| source | why there is no route | what to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| `era5-l137` | ERA5 model-level data is a queued Copernicus CDS MARS request (dataset `reanalysis-era5-complete`, `levtype=ml`), not files at a predictable URL, and the request runs under your own CDS account | submit the model-level request yourself into a folder DIR, fetch the same hours' surface analysis beside it with `woof fetch --source era5 --cycle CYCLE --hours HOURS --area AREA --retrieve --out DIR`, then `woof prep --source era5-l137 --source-root DIR --experiment-config CONFIG.toml --wps-namelist CONFIG.namelist.wps` |
| `20crv3` | the every-member GRIB2 archive is not published on an anonymously readable public endpoint; only the ensemble-MEAN NetCDF distribution is, and a member state is not a mean | stage the member's files in DIR, then `woof prep --source 20crv3 --source-root DIR --author-only --author-input-manifest DIR/member-manifest.json`, which prints the `--source-manifest` pair the run binds |
| `20crv3-cf` | the NOAA PSL NetCDF distribution is a per-year, per-variable reanalysis archive with no cycle and no forecast lead, so `--cycle`/`--hours` describe nothing in it | fill DIR with `tools/download_20crv3_native_subset.py` and its window flags plus `--output DIR` (it rebuilds the missing orography and land mask into `invariant.nc`), then `woof prep --source 20crv3-cf --source-root DIR --experiment-config CONFIG.toml --wps-namelist CONFIG.namelist.wps` |
| `mapped` | the generic declarative adapter is not a product: it names no publisher, no bucket and no file grammar, so there is nothing to resolve | it *is* the door for bytes you already have -- supply the mapping and composition documents with the files (`--mapping`, `--composition`, `--provenance`, `--input`, `--supplement`) |

`--source-root` binds the folder by the source's own row in
`woof/authorities/rw-wps-fetch-routes.v1.json`: which files are the
ordered inputs (by name pattern and by the format their leading bytes
carry) and which file is each supplement role. It authors the input
manifest as `DIR/inputs.json`, and with no `--output-root` it writes the
prepared tree beside the experiment config as `CONFIG-prepared`, then
prints the `woof sim` line that runs the forecast and draws every
product from each output as it lands. Run again, it prepares into the
next free `CONFIG-prepared-N`, since a folder that exists is never
written over. It keeps `DIR/inputs.json` while the folder's files are
unchanged; after they or this WOOF's decoders change it writes a new
one and says which one it replaced. Each preparation keeps its own copy
of the manifest it was made from. Adding a hand-staged source is a row
there, not a code path.

For `era5-l137`, `20crv3` and `20crv3-cf`, `woof domain` emits a
`[fetch]` table carrying the source, cycle, hours and the folder the
bytes go in, and step 1 of the printed
next-steps block is the staging note rather than a `woof fetch` line
that would refuse: for `era5-l137` it spells the model-level request for
this config's hours and area and the `woof fetch --source era5 --retrieve` line
that writes the surface analysis into the same folder. Step 3, `woof go
CONFIG.toml --data-dir DIR`, binds that folder by the same row and runs
the whole chain. Everything else in the file is complete: geometry,
levels, physics, time step, radiation cadence and the boundary interval.

Fourteen further registry rows are registered but **not runnable**
(`hgefs`, `hiresw`, `href`, `hrrr-ak`, `nam`, `nbm`, `refs`, `rrfs-a`,
`rrfs-firewx`, `rrfs-public`, `rtma`, `sref`, `urma`, `wrf`). They are not
planned by `woof domain` and not downloaded by `woof fetch`, and both
doors say which of the four states the row is in -- `adapter_mapping_required`,
`explicit_composition_required`, `member_selection_and_mapping_required`
or `wrf_archive_mapping_required` -- rather than "invalid choice":

```
woof fetch: error: argument --source: --source nam: no fetch route.
  why: the registry row is not runnable (adapter_mapping_required);
  nothing in this WOOF could read the bytes a download produced.
  see: `woof sources` for what each registered source can do today.
```

Adding a download route for one of them is a row in the route document
plus the profile work its status names. It is not a new code path.

## ICON-D2

`--source icon-d2` (aliases `icon-2km`, `dwd-icon-d2`) starts a forecast
from DWD's convection-permitting ICON-D2: nominally 2.2 km, Germany and
its neighbours, a run every 3 hours (00, 03, ... 21 UTC), each to 48
hours at one-hour steps. DWD publishes a run about 45 minutes after its
start and all of it within about 1 h 25 min, and keeps each run for about
a day, so only the last day of starts can be downloaded.

```
woof domain --point 50.1,8.7 --card 16gb --root-dx 1 --hours 3 \
      --source icon-d2 --cycle latest --out frankfurt.toml
woof go frankfurt.toml
```

It reads DWD's native icosahedral objects through the same GDT-101
normalization as `icon-global`, remapped onto your domain plus a
0.25-degree halo at 0.02 degrees. DWD's regular lat/lon ICON-D2 product
is not used: it leaves the part of its bounding box outside the model
domain empty in every field.

The domain must lie inside lat 44.0..57.3, lon 0.0..17.3. DWD leaves the
outer 13 km of the model domain empty, and the model domain is a tilted
shape, so that box is the largest one whose every cell is published.

The default route reads all 65 model levels and their 66 invariant height
interfaces, extending to about 22 km. It reads pressure and water vapor on
those levels and initializes cloud water, ice, rain, snow and graupel from
the published fields. The generated configuration uses a 60 hPa model top;
the 5 km damping layer therefore stays above the deep troposphere.
Mass-level heights are the means of their bounding interfaces. Published
water fractions are converted to the forecast's mass basis by declared
mapping operations, including the condensate contribution to moist mass.

## Adding a source

Nothing in `woof/domain_wizard.py` names a model. A new row reaches this
door by declaring, in `woof/source_adapters.py`:

- `runnable=True` and the profile/runner the decode route uses;
- `forcing_interval_seconds` -- the source's native spacing between valid
  times. For a row with a packaged profile this is the mapping document's
  `target.boundary_interval_seconds`, and a test fails if the two ever
  disagree, for every row that has one. It reproduces the number the
  2026-08-17 battery typed into its hand-written namelists by hand. When
  the product can be read at any whole multiple of that spacing, the
  mapping's `target` also declares `"accept_boundary_interval_multiples":
  true`, and a test fails if the source's fetch offers a cadence the
  mapping does not take;
- `max_forecast_hour` -- 0 for an analysis or reanalysis, which also turns
  off `--forecast-start-hour` with that reason named;
- `coverage=` a `RegularLatLonWindow` or a `LambertGridWindow` if the
  product is regional; nothing at all if it is global.

`tests/test_wizard_sources.py` proves the claim rather than asserting it:
it installs a synthetic registry row and drives the real CLI, checking
that the emitted `namelist.wps` carries the cadence the row declared and
that a regional variant refuses outside the window the row declared, with
no code added anywhere.
