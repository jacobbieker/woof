# Receipts: gray zone, the Shin-Hong (`bl_pbl_physics = 11`) acceptance ladder

The receipts behind the gray-zone statements about Shin-Hong in
[PHYSICS.md](../../PHYSICS.md), committed beside the page that cites them.
The reference side is Honnert, Masson and Couvreux (2011) eq. (9)-(14),
transcribed in `gpuwm/verify/gray_zone.py` as a REFERENCE and nothing else:
no model path reads that module, it participates in no configuration
identity, and it is kept out of the closure's own authority module so that
scoring a closure against it can never become fitting the closure to it.
The bands below were instantiated and committed **before any run with
`--pbl 11` existed anywhere**.

## Instrument identity

The scored quantity is the mixed-layer (`0.05 <= z/h <= 0.85`) mean subgrid
TKE fraction over twelve 300 s snapshots in the final hour of a 4 h dry
convective boundary layer, 64x64 columns, nz=40 to 2 km, on a
3200/1600/800/400/200/100 m grid-spacing ladder. The instrument is
`gpuwm.verify.cases.cbl_dry.partition_run` driven by
`tools/grayzone_phase0.py`, both in this repository, at commit `82c8155b`;
the scoring path is byte-identical to the one the frozen baseline was
measured with (`gpuwm/verify/gray_zone.py` diffs zero against it). The tree
under test is `61488333`. The card is one RTX 5090: no ECC, so the
same-seed determinism pairs are the corruption screen, not a formality.

`h` is each run's own S3-6f bulk-Richardson depth and the abscissa is
`x = dx/h` at that depth, so every rung is scored at its own `x` rather
than at the baseline's.

## What each file is

- `PHASE1-SHINHONG-20260803.md`, the ladder report: the six-rung scored
  table with each rung's `x`, `h`, seed-mean, seed sigma, the published
  eq. (9) target, the envelope, the band and the verdict; the 36 scored
  cells one seed at a time; the five registered criteria answered line by
  line; the determinism digests; the two non-scored control runs that show
  the merge did not move the baseline; and the measured cost.
- `shinhong_runs.jsonl`, the 42 run receipts the report reduces: 36 scored
  (6 rungs x 6 seeds, `repeat 0`) and 6 determinism rerolls (seed 20260801
  a second time at each rung, `repeat 1`). Registered budget spent exactly;
  no run crashed, no cell is missing, nothing was re-run. Each record
  carries its own scored scalar, `h`, `x`, the target and envelope
  evaluated at that `x`, the twelve per-snapshot samples, the wall time,
  the tree it ran on, and the profile-stack digest. `python
  tools/grayzone_phase0.py score --ledger shinhong_runs.jsonl` reduces it,
  and everything the report measures comes back out of this file alone:
  the six seed-means, the six `sigma_own`, the six `h` and `x`, all six
  determinism digests, and the cost section's 3099.1 s total with its
  per-rung 50.4 / 98.2 / 209.4 / 428.7 / 796.5 / 1515.9 s. The one input
  that is not in here is the frozen baseline sigma, which enters only
  through `sigma_used = max(frozen, own)`, and the report prints the
  result of that step in its `sigma_used` column at every rung, so the
  bands are checkable regardless.
- `npz/cbl_dry_partition_<dx>m_seed<seed>_shinhong.npz`, 36 per-run
  profile stacks, one per scored cell: `subgrid_fraction`, `e_resolved`
  and `e_subgrid` as (12 snapshots x 40 levels), the snapshot times `t`
  and depths `h` as (12,), and the height column `z` (40,). These are the
  arrays behind every scored scalar, so a reader can recompute a rung's
  mixed-layer window rather than take the reduction on trust.

## How to read these

1. **The bands were registered before the runs, and the ladder is scored
   against them as written.** `band = envelope +/- 2*sigma_used/sqrt(6)`,
   `sigma_used = max(frozen baseline sigma at that rung, this leg's own)`.
   No band was widened, re-centred or re-cut after the data existed.
2. **This is one idealized case.** A dry convective boundary layer, six
   seeds, one card, one day. It measures how the scheme's partition of
   turbulence between resolved and subgrid motion moves with grid spacing,
   against a published similarity curve. **It is not skill against
   observations, and no free-forecast obs-skill claim is made for this
   scheme anywhere in this repository.**
3. **The 3200 m rung is advisory and was never gated**, by the registered
   rule and not by hindsight: it sits on 2x2-block-degenerate ground and at
   an `x` the frozen baseline never occupied. It is recorded because it was
   run, not because it counts.
4. **Conformance and this are different axes.** The ladder says nothing
   about agreement with WRF; that is the oracle parity in
   `tests/test_shinhong_wrf461_parity.py`, reported separately. Passing
   this ladder moved no maturity rung: the option is
   `implemented-unverified` in the registry before and after, because no
   matched WOOF-versus-WRF forecast trajectory has been run with it.
5. **The determinism digests cannot be recomputed from the `npz` files.**
   The digest is SHA-256 over each snapshot's own height column as well as
   its three partition arrays, and the `npz` retains the height column
   once. Reproducing a digest means re-running the cell, which is what the
   report's later matches of the 3200 m digest are: five in total for
   that one cell, on a card with no ECC.

## Adaptations (release hygiene)

Same pattern as the neighbouring receipt directories. **37 of the 38
archive files ship byte-identical**: `shinhong_runs.jsonl` and all 36
`npz` stacks, verified by sha256 against the development copies. The one
transformed file is `PHASE1-SHINHONG-20260803.md`, and it differs only in
prose:

- one citation of a document that does not ship is reduced from its in-tree
  path to its bare filename, keeping the name and the commit so it stays
  checkable in the development history, and a sentence is added saying that
  it and the one other non-shipping document the report cites (already
  cited by bare filename) are covered in the omissions list below;
- one word is corrected in criterion 1: the flatness yardstick reads
  `sigma_seed`, not `sigma_used`. Both numbers beside it are the report's
  own and are untouched, `0.004941` is 2 x the largest seed sigma
  (`0.0024704`, at 400 m) and `157x` is `0.775164 / 0.004941`, and the
  registered F1 criterion is itself written in `sigma_seed`, so the
  correction makes the label agree with the arithmetic and with the
  criterion. Read as `sigma_used` the threshold would be `0.006016` and
  the ratio `129x`; the verdict is the same either way and neither number
  appears in the report;
- one sentence of the non-regression section, which referred an internal
  process question to the project owner, is dropped, and a dated addendum
  is appended recording how those four items were actually resolved, with
  the commit for each. The measured statement it sat beside (that the
  registered "full CPU suite passes unchanged" bullet was false as
  measured) is left standing exactly as written; the addendum updates it
  rather than editing it.

Every measured number, digest, band and verdict in that file is
byte-untouched. The introducing commit records the exact mapping, and the
original survives in the development history at `b159f2a0`.

## Deliberately not included

- **The registered expectation,
  `2026-08-03-shinhong-grayzone-expectation.md` (commit `31275170`)**: a
  development-campaign document, excluded from the release like the rest of
  that tree. It is cited by name in the ladder report and its load-bearing
  content is restated there: the five registered criteria are answered one
  at a time, in order, with the measurement each one is answered by; the
  bands it froze are the report's `band (I1)` column; and the claim that
  matters (written and committed before any `--pbl 11` run existed) is
  checkable at that commit in the development history. It also republished
  the frozen sigmas, which reach the bands only as described in the next
  bullet.
- **The frozen Phase-0 baseline, `PHASE0-BASELINE-20260803.md` (commit
  `67ac01b1`)**: likewise internal, and on a separate campaign branch. Its
  load-bearing content survives in the ladder report, and it is worth being
  exact about how much. Its per-rung seed-means are quoted verbatim in the
  report's `HEAD mean` column, for contrast only: they are not a band
  input and no verdict depends on them. Its frozen sigmas reach the bands
  only through `max(frozen, own)`, and the report prints that result at
  every rung: at 3200, 1600 and 100 m the frozen value is the larger one,
  so those three appear verbatim in the `sigma_used` column; 800 m's is
  quoted again in the report's controls table; and at 400 and 200 m the
  leg's own sigma is larger, so the frozen value cannot move the band and
  is not needed to check one.
- **The Phase-0 baseline's own ledger and profile stacks**: the 48 runs
  behind that `HEAD mean` column. They score a different closure
  (`bl_pbl_physics = 900`), no public claim about Shin-Hong rests on them,
  and shipping them would double this directory to back a contrast column.
- **The two non-scored `--pbl 900` control runs' ledger**: the merge check
  in the report's "Controls" section. Both numbers, both abscissae, the
  frozen sigmas they are compared against and the agreement in sigmas are
  stated in the report itself.
- **Wall-clock and node state**: no node time was used; the whole campaign
  ran on the local card, and the per-rung run times that mattered are in
  the report's cost section.
