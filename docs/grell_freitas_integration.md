# Grell-Freitas (`cu_physics = 3`): what a release integrator needs to know

Lane: `lane/gf-port`. Target: `integration/release-1.6`. This is the short
form. The conformance argument lives in the registry entry
(`woof/physics_registry_v2.json`,
`components.cumulus.options.grell-freitas`) and in the parity suites; this
file is only the set of things that will bite someone folding the lane in.

## 1. The label is `implemented-unverified`, and a run does not change that

`scientific_evidence: none`. Grell-Freitas is bitwise against WRF v4.6.1
at the whole-driver boundary (216 oracle columns, 208 of them word for
word on both the float32 CPU authority and the CUDA translation unit, the
remaining 8 bounded by the driver's own `module_gfs_physcons` mixed
precision at max 34 ULP) and that is **conformance evidence, not
scientific validation**. No scored woof/WRF forecast comparison exists
for this scheme.

A first real-case trajectory (below) establishes that the scheme
integrates a real domain without diverging, and that a dual run of it is
byte-reproducible. It does **not** establish forecast skill, and it is not
grounds to move the label. Moving to `supported` needs a scored
comparison against obs (MRMS/ASOS), on the project's own
obs-skill-is-the-referee terms.

## 2. Selection surface

* `cu_physics = 3`, per domain, on the tree route only
  (`reachability: component-override`, the Shin-Hong/SASE posture).
* `cudt_minutes = 0` is **enforced, not chosen**:
  `validate_run_config` refuses a nonzero `cudt` for `cu_physics = 3` by
  name. GF runs on the model step (WRF's usual GF configuration,
  `STEPCU = 1`) and carries no NCA hold, so the KF cadence knob has no
  meaning here.
* `clos_choice = 0` (the 16-member ensemble closure) is the arm the
  oracle covers. 1-16 run one closure member alone, WRF's own code
  path: the kernel matches the float32 reference on all sixteen
  (`tests/test_gf_closure_choice_cuda.py`) and the load warns that no
  WRF run covers them. Other values are refused (above 16 reads past
  the 16-member closure array). `ishallow` is 0 or 1, both covered, 0
  is the WRF Registry default.
* Both Grell-family keys are refused wherever no Grell scheme is selected,
  so unrelated configs cannot carry them.
* **WOOF structural seam:** 390 (`pbl = 0`, `cu = 3`) cells of the WRF
  v4.6.1 compatibility matrix are admitted by WRF and refused by WOOF.
  WRF reads `KPBL = 0` there and indexes below the column base; WOOF
  refuses rather than reproduces. This is the second named structural
  seam and it is deliberate.

## 3. The corrected-k22 default, and the flag that is not a config key

WRF's shallow k22 trigger is a `MAXLOC` over the array section
`heo_cup(2:kbmax)` whose result `module_cu_gf_sh.F` uses as an absolute
level index without adding the section offset. **The shipped kernel uses
the corrected indexing** (owner ruling, no inherited WRF bugs).

The WRF-faithful off-by-one exists only behind a launch argument
(`k22_wrf_faithful`) that the parity suites set directly. It has **no
`RunConfig` spelling**: deliberately, and there is a test that asserts
so. An integrator should not add one.

The restart identity binds the choice:
`grell-freitas-wrf461-gfdrv-corrected-k22-v1`. A checkpoint written under
the shipped identity cannot resume under a WRF-faithful build.

Measured ledger for the difference: k22 moves on 3 of 18 fixture cases,
all three rejected under both modes with identical `ierr`, and **zero**
output words differ at either boundary.

## 4. Engine-seam deviations (the plumb-list for any label upgrade)

The kernel is bitwise; these are about what the engine can hand it today.

1. **Forcing tendencies: CLOSED.** GFDRV sums advective
   (`RTHFTEN`/`RQVFTEN`), radiative (`RTHRATEN`) and boundary-layer
   (`RTHBLTEN`/`RQVBLTEN`) forcing into its forced state, and all four
   lanes are now fed, all read off the driver through `bind_driver`. The
   boundary-layer pair is the PBL slot's own raw dry-theta/qv rates,
   retained by `PhysicsDriver._couple_pbl_slot` whichever of YSU, MYJ,
   MYNN, Shin-Hong or SASE holds the slot, which is how WRF's own
   cumulus driver reads RTHBLTEN/RQVBLTEN. The advective pair is the
   integrator's export: on the ARW path the dycore captures pure theta
   and qv advection at RK stage 1 of every step, uncouples it to
   K s<sup>-1</sup> and kg kg<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, and leaves it
   in `state.rthften`/`state.rqvften` for the next step's cumulus call,
   the same one-step producer/consumer lag `h_diabatic` has. (The MPAS
   seam's caller supplies its own.) The rate-of-change closure family
   therefore sees its advective forcing, the instability closures see
   the current state, the omega/moisture-convergence closures are fully
   fed, and with `ishallow = 1` the shallow `blqe` member sees a real
   `dhdt`.

   The export is **pure advection**, deliberately.
   `module_cumulus_driver.F:867` pre-folds `RTHRATEN + RTHBLTEN` into
   `RTHFTEN` for `G3SCHEME` and `NTIEDTKESCHEME` and **not** for
   `GFSCHEME`, which sums the three lanes itself
   (`kernels/gf.cu:4428`). A pre-folded RTHFTEN here would make GF
   integrate the boundary layer and the sky twice.

   **Restart consequence, stated plainly:** the pair is serialized
   state, so a `cu_physics = 3` checkpoint written before this landed
   carries two fewer state arrays than this build expects and is
   refused by name. Resume from a checkpoint this build wrote, or start
   the run again from its prepared state. No other configuration's
   checkpoints move.
2. **Convective momentum tendencies.** The kernel computes GF's
   `dudt`/`dvdt`; `CumulusResult` carries no momentum slots, so they are
   not coupled. WRF couples them.
3. **w on mass levels** is the KF-precedent average `0.5*(w[k]+w[k+1])`.

**MEASURED regime behaviour (2026-08-17).** Two 12 km single-domain 6 h
real-case twin pairs (150x120x49, tree route, KF control differing only
in `cu_physics`/`cudt`): under strong synoptic forcing (1974-04-03
12-18Z) GF's domain-mean RAINC is ~40% of KF's, ordinary inter-scheme
spread; under weak forcing (1999-05-03 12-18Z, Ohio valley) it is 1-2%
of KF's, nearly silent where KF still rains (KF RAINC max 2.2 mm, GF
0.18 mm). A column-level probe of the weak-forcing state (18,000 real
columns through `gf_gfdrv_stage`, four arms: shipped zero forcing,
HFX/QFX-reconstructed RTHBLTEN/RQVBLTEN, ±1 K/day radiative) found the
deep trigger rejecting every column in every arm, so the weak-forcing
silence is the bitwise scheme's own trigger/closure response to these
inputs, no fed forcing arm revives it, and feeding reconstructed BL
rates alone REDUCED convecting columns on the strongly forced state
(3162 → 2068 of 18,000; the dicycle closure subtracts BL-driven
instability by design). Any seam upgrade must therefore be validated
against obs skill, not against "more rain"; a user report of "GF is
broken / makes no rain" on a weakly forced case is this measured shape,
not an adapter defect.

## 5. VRAM: GF's backing store, and the cut that removed it

RETIRED 2026-08-21, and kept here because the mechanism is worth reading.

One GF thread owns one whole GFDRV column, so the per-thread local frame
USED TO BE the deep+shallow local-array stack: **22,416 B** at the nz=40
tier, rising 456 B per level. By the reservation law in
`docs/kernel_local_memory_bounds.md` the driver sizes the backing store to
the device's whole resident-thread capacity on the kernel's first launch
and holds it for the life of the process, so that frame cost

```
(22,416 - 1,024) * 1,536 *  70  =  2.14 GiB          [RTX 5070 Ti]
(22,416 - 1,024) * 1,536 * 170  =  5.20 GiB          [RTX 5090]
```

while the kernel only ever had 384 threads/SM in flight.

The column arrays now live in a global workspace `woof/core/gf.py` sizes
to the columns IN FLIGHT (`woof/core/kernels/gf.cu`, section "Per-thread
column workspace").  MEASURED on a development machine: the frame is 72 B, the
reservation is 4.0 MiB, and the workspace costs 422.1 MiB at the shipped
tile.  `woof check` prices the workspace under `NON-POOL` where it used
to price the frame; section 7 of `docs/kernel_local_memory_bounds.md`
carries the full before/after.

**Selecting GF is no longer what sets the local-memory term.** On a
`cu_physics = 3` tree the widest frame is now some other module's -- the
same one-thread-one-column shape in `ysu`, `shinhong`, `nssl2` and `refl`.

## 6. CLOSED: the frame that did not fit is gone

`configs/real74_4dom_gf.toml` did not fit, and the route registered here
was a code change. **It landed on 2026-08-21**, and by a better road than
the one this section proposed.

The proposal was to specialize `gf.cu`'s per-thread frame the way
`KF_KMAX`/`REFL_KMAX` were specialized. That would have divided the
reservation by the level ratio and left it proportional to `nz`. What
landed instead moves the column arrays **out of the local frame entirely**,
into a global workspace sized to the threads actually in flight
(`docs/kernel_local_memory_bounds.md` sections 7 and 8). The difference
matters: the reservation does not shrink, it **stops existing**, and it
stops moving with `nz` at all.

Measured on a development machine (RTX 5070 Ti, 70 SM x 1,536, sm_120):

| kernel | frame before | frame after | reservation before | after |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gf_gfdrv_stage` | 22,416 B | 88 B (NVRTC 13.0) / 72 B (13.3) | 2,200.0 MiB | 4.0 MiB |
| `ysu_column` | 9,232 B | 0 B (both builds) | 842.0 MiB | none |

YSU is in the table because it is what the GF cut uncovered: with GF out of
the way, YSU held the widest frame a **bare default run** launched, and
`bl_pbl_physics = 1` is the wizard's default.

### What the four-domain arm costs now

`woof check`, re-measured 2026-08-21:

| config | device-footprint projection |
|---|---|
| `real74_4dom.toml` (KF base) | 21.52 GiB |
| `real74_4dom_gf.toml` | **22.17 GiB** |
| `real74_2dom_gf.toml` | 11.05 GiB |

The GF arm is now **0.65 GiB** over the KF base, where this section
recorded 3.67 GiB (27.79 against 24.12). **Stated plainly: the acceptance
criterion written here (GF back *under* the four-domain base's footprint)
is NOT met.** It is 0.65 GiB over, because GF's column workspace (0.47 GiB
at this configuration) is a real allocation that the local frame's
reservation used to hide. The 3.2 GiB obstruction is gone; a smaller,
accurate one is in its place.

These three rows are measured on the **current Windows host, an RTX 3080
with 68 SMs**. The 32,607 MiB card the original table was measured on moved
to a development machine on 2026-08-16, so that box no longer exists and the two
tables are not the same instrument. The *delta* between configs is the
comparable quantity, not the absolute GiB.

Disk remains an independent and unchanged limit: four domains at these
cadences is ~244 GB of wrfout per arm, ~488 GB for a dual run, against
242 GB free on the largest volume. Not even one arm fits, and nothing may
be deleted. **Whether the four-domain GF arm is now runnable is therefore
still NOT MEASURED**: the memory obstruction is closed, the disk one is
not, and no four-domain GF run has been attempted.

GF parity is unaffected by the cut: the frame was allocation size, not a
value any loop reads, and the interleaved A/B in
`docs/kernel_local_memory_bounds.md` section 7 records 141,480 graded
words with 0 differing, both controls firing.

## 7. Restart: `cu_physics = 3` could not checkpoint until a4c06235

The GF selectable-wiring commit (`ea0cada3`) taught the restart manifest
GF's algorithm identity and its coefficient-table absence, but not GF's
**callable shape**. The adapter stores the `PhysicsDriver` that
`bind_driver` hands it (that is how it reads the held radiative rates)
and `_callable_state_check` walks one level into object attributes, so the
driver's own arrays appeared under the cumulus callable unclassified.
Every checkpoint of a GF run raised `RestartManifestError`. The first
real-case GF trajectory integrated 179 outer steps and died at its first
restart.

Fixed in `a4c06235`: `_driver` is classified rebuild-on-load in
`CUMULUS_CALLABLE_CONTAINERS`, on the KF `_history_state` precedent. Both
are back-references, not state. **Nothing of GF's is serialized as new
restart state, because GF holds none**: `cu_physics = 3` is a stateless
Task-1 callable with no NCA persistence, no trigger history (no `W0AVG`),
and no closure memory. Every GF quantity with memory between calls already
lived on the driver and was already serialized there: held rates through
`cu_rates`' `cu_rthcuten`/`cu_rqvcuten`/`cu_rqccuten`/`cu_rqicuten`
scratch slots, precipitation accumulators through
`cu_rainc`/`cu_raincv`/`cu_pratec`.

Gated by `tests/test_restart.py::
test_short_grell_freitas_restart_is_bit_identical` (20 steps + restart +
20 steps == 40 steps, FP32-bit-exact, on a state where GF actually
convects) and by the CPU-tier
`test_every_cumulus_adapter_attribute_is_classified`, which walks every
selectable cumulus adapter live.

**Integrator note:** a GF adapter that ever grows real state must be
serialized, not added to the container allowlist. The classification
comment in `woof/io/restart.py` says so at the point of use.
