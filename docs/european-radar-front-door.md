# European radar, from a file to an analysis increment

`woof obs radar` is the door. Everything on this page runs from a
`pip install recast-woof`: no source checkout, no demo script, no flag whose name
begins with "experimental".

This is the polar-volume route: per-site scans carrying **radial velocity**,
which is what makes a European radar assimilable. The 2-D OPERA composite is a
different product on a different binary (`rw_opera`,
`woof.obs.opera`); it grades a forecast and cannot be assimilated, because a
composite has no elevation geometry and no velocity. `docs/international-obs.md`
covers that one.

## The five-minute version

```sh
woof obs radar doctor                      # is the decoder here, and is it the right build
woof obs radar volumes --dir ./scans       # what volumes are in this directory
woof obs radar pack --dir ./scans --out v.pack --quantities DBZH,VRADH \
                     --max-elevation-deg 25 --max-range-km 200
woof obs radar nyquist --file ./scans/one.h5      # can its velocity be unfolded
woof obs radar grid --pack v.pack --grid-wrfout wrfout_d01_... --out obs.nc \
                     --max-range-km 200 --max-elevation-deg 25 \
                     --clear-air-from-censor --dealias
```

`grid` writes the observation file the LETKF adapter reads. From there the
path is `woof.da.obs_radar` and `assimilate_radar_grid`, which are the same
functions a NEXRAD volume goes through: there is no European branch below the
pack, and that is the whole point of the design.

## Getting the decoder

`woof obs radar doctor` answers two questions at once: is `rw_odim` on this
box, and is it the build whose record contract this woof was written against.
A rebuilt-but-unchanged binary passes; one whose records changed shape does
not, and the message says to rebuild rather than leaving a mismatch to surface
as a confusing parse error three commands later.

If it is missing, `woof fetch-bridges` stages it, `rw_odim` travels in the
bridge bundle beside `rw_nexrad`, for the same reason `rw_nexrad` does: the
alternative is telling every user to install a Rust toolchain, which is the one
prerequisite this project otherwise never imposes.

The composite route's binary does **not**. `rw_opera`, and its three siblings
`rw_mrms`, `rw_stage4` and `rw_asos`, are in no bundle: none of them embeds the
`GPUWM_BRIDGE_SOURCE_REV` stamp a release cut proves a staged bridge with, so
they cannot be bundled until `crates/rw-obs` gains a `build.rs`. Those four
still need a source checkout and a toolchain.

## Two shapes of volume, and why the door has two flags for them

National feeds do not agree on what a file is.

| feed | one volume is | ODIM `/what/object` | use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Netherlands, Romania | one file | `PVOL` | `pack --file` |
| Germany | one file per (elevation, quantity) | `SCAN` | `pack --dir` |

A German ten-elevation volume arrives as many files that mean nothing apart:
measured on the live feed, **30**, because it serves `TH` beside `DBZH` and
`VRADH`. `pack --dir` assembles them, and
`volumes --dir` is what you run first to see what a directory actually holds.

**The assembly refuses two things rather than repairing them.** A directory
holding more than one nominal time needs `--stamp` to say which volume is
wanted; taking the newest would put a volume nobody asked for behind a record
that looks completely ordinary. And two files merge into one sweep only when
they agree on the entire cut identity (elevation, ray and bin counts, range
scale, range start, start and end times) *and* their per-ray azimuths match.
Elevation alone is not enough: a Dutch volume carries three sweeps at 0.30
degrees with two different Nyquist intervals, and separate reflectivity and
Doppler passes at one angle are ordinary radar practice. Files that do not
match become two sweeps, which is the accurate reading, and the pack records the
merge ratio so the reading is visible rather than assumed.

An assembled volume has no bytes of its own, so its `source_sha256` is a
**manifest** digest (the SHA-256 of the sorted `"<sha256>  <name>"` lines of
its members) and the record's `assembled` block carries the members so a
reader can still name the actual bytes.

## Antenna altitude

Beam height above ground is a function of antenna height above mean sea level,
so a site assimilated with the wrong antenna height places every gate at the
wrong altitude, smoothly, with nothing that looks like a failure.

`woof obs radar sites --require-assimilable` runs that check and prints the
refusal in full. Without the flag the `assimilable` field is `null`, not
`true`: a check that did not run has no verdict, and printing one would be a
claim nobody made.

The frozen table is a fallback. Every ODIM volume carries `/where/height`, so a
pack built by `pack` answers the antenna height from the file and never needs
the table at all.

## Clear air is an observation, and ODIM has three states for "no echo"

`grid --clear-air-from-censor` builds clear-air zeroes from the decoder's own
per-gate reason codes rather than only from finite gates below the floor. On an
ODIM pack the admitted code is `undetect`: the processor reporting that it
looked and found nothing, which is the most common true observation on any
scan and every correct negative a skill score is built on.

Two ODIM states are **never** admitted, in any configuration:

- `nodata`: the radar reporting it did not look. Unobserved, not empty.
- `sentinel_ambiguous`: a file that declared `nodata` and `undetect` as the
  same raw value, so the gate may be either. Finnish `VRADH` does exactly
  this: 721,898 gates in one measured volume, 76 % of a single sweep. Reading
  them as clear air would assimilate "no echo" into cells that may hold one.

Both are counted, and the counts are in the written provenance, so the refusal
is visible rather than merely asserted here. The written `clear_air_source` is
`undetect_and_finite_below_floor` for an ODIM pack and
`below_threshold_and_finite_below_floor` for a NEXRAD one: the same admission
rule, different instruments making the claim, and a consumer is entitled to
know which it is holding.

## Dealiasing

`grid --dealias` unfolds radial velocity per sweep before gridding instead of
masking every gate that might be folded. It needs scipy and says so.

Nothing about it is European, and the proof is that the result sorts itself by
Nyquist exactly as the physics demands. Measured on the real Den Helder volume
of 2026-08-14 13:00Z, 15 cuts, 22,656 gates unfolded against 428,517 left
unchanged:

| Nyquist | cuts | gates unfolded |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 6.0 m/s | 2 | 8,051 and 14,554 |
| 32.0 m/s | 5 | 3, 4, 1, 9, 34 |
| 48.0 m/s | 2 | 0 |
| 80.0 m/s | 6 | 0 |

Velocity folds constantly at ±6 m/s and almost nothing in this scene exceeds
±80 m/s, so that is the shape the answer has to have. A dealiaser that was
silently not running would give zeros everywhere; one running wrongly would
not sort itself this way. The account also closes on itself -- the record
carries `accounting_balances: true` over 767,542 gates offered.

`nyquist --file` is the handoff, and it reports provenance as well as value:
`Declared` (the file stated `NI`), `DerivedSinglePrf`, or `Unavailable`. A
sweep whose interval could not be established is refused by name rather than
unfolded against a guess, because a wrong ceiling does not fail loudly: it
just produces wind.

## Command reference

Every option below exists in the parser, and every option in the parser is
below. `tests/test_obs_cli_frontdoor.py` asserts that in both directions
against this section, so a flag added to one and not the other fails the
suite. `-h` / `--help` are argparse's own and are not listed.
