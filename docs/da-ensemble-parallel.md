The cycling radar-DA driver advanced its trajectories one at a time:
eleven fresh models built and torn down per leg for a ten-member run.
`--member-workers N` advances N of them at once. The default is 1 --
the serial path, unchanged.

## What the measurements said, and why the design is not streams

The expectation going in was CUDA streams: give each member a
non-blocking stream, remove the device-wide barriers, let the members
overlap. That expectation was wrong, and it was wrong for a reason worth
writing down.

A member leg was never split into host setup and GPU integration. It is
now (`--member-workers` aside, every run reports `phase_seconds` per
trajectory). On the live-fire-3 shape, 132x132x49 with dt 15 s:

| phase | seconds |
|---|---|
| `wire` -- prepared-cache read, per-array SHA-256, land-use, physics init | 0.10 |
| `integrate` -- 60 GPU steps | 1.7 - 5.0 |

So hoisting the cache restore out of the member loop, the cheap win that
was expected to dominate, is worth 3-5% and no more.

But the integration is not GPU-bound either. `tools/da_probe_phase.py`
brackets `execute_experiment` with CUDA events and cProfile at the same
time:

    wall 5.02 s | event span 5.02 s | profiler total 5.02 s

Those being one number means the interpreter is busy for essentially the
whole leg while the device waits. The costs, per leg:

| what | seconds |
|---|---|
| Dudhia shortwave (a 49-level Python loop issuing thousands of tiny CuPy ops) | 1.94 |
| 120 blocking `.item()` calls | 0.77 |
| 120 `free_all_blocks` calls from the per-step pool trim | 0.71 |

A workload like that does not overlap on streams, because what needs
overlapping is Python. The probes confirm it:

| arrangement | width 2 | width 4 |
|---|---|---|
| threads on non-blocking streams | **0.97x** | **0.83x** |
| separate processes | **1.40x** | **1.46x** |

Threads lose outright -- the GIL serializes the dispatch and contention
makes it worse. Processes overlap but saturate almost immediately:
0.287, 0.400, 0.414, 0.419, 0.414 legs/s at widths 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. The
box has 32 cores and they are not the limit; separate CUDA contexts
time-slice under WDDM, and Windows has no MPS. **The ceiling is ~1.45x
and width 2 buys 1.40x of it.**

This is also why nothing here folds a member axis into the kernels.
That rewrite touches 100 `__global__` entry points across 26 modules,
moves a `source_sha256` the kernel manifest and the FTZ receipt pin, and
optimises the half of the machine that is already idle.

## Bit-identical, and how that is known

Members are mathematically independent, so any difference between the
arms would be a defect -- in shared state, allocator ordering,
handle-to-stream association, or a cross-member reduction -- never
acceptable noise. Three things make the claim structural rather than
hopeful:

- **One body, two arms.** `tools/da_member_leg.py::run_member_leg` is
  the driver's old loop body. The serial path and the worker call that
  same function; the concurrent arm is not a second implementation.
- **Order cannot reach the analysis.** Results are keyed by trajectory
  name and consumed in `trajectories` order, and the LETKF still reads
  its backgrounds from disk in `sorted()` index order.
- **Isolation is asserted.** `run_member_leg` refuses a model carrying a
  shared scratch arena or the shared dycore-state workspace. That
  failure mode is silent cross-member corruption, not an exception, so
  it is checked rather than assumed.

Proven with `tools/da_identity_check.py`, which compares raw bytes
(`np.array_equal`, NaN-aware) and fails on one ULP. On the smoke case
(100x80x49, five trajectories, two legs, a real LETKF analysis applied
between them), 727 arrays and report leaves per comparison:

| arms | result |
|---|---|
| serial vs `--member-workers 2` | BYTE-IDENTICAL |
| serial vs `--member-workers 3` (uneven split) | BYTE-IDENTICAL |
| serial vs `--no-pool-trim` | BYTE-IDENTICAL |
| pre-refactor driver vs post-refactor serial | identical on all 537 shared leaves |

Run it yourself with `--keep-member-snapshots` on both arms, which
writes every trajectory's leg-end state -- the thing the next leg
restores -- to `<out>/snapshots/legNNN/<name>.npz`.

## The device budget

The DA driver hand-builds its `ExperimentState` and so bypasses
`estimate_experiment`; this route has never had a VRAM gate at all.
`--member-workers > 1` now prices the one thing width changes -- a CUDA
context and a local-memory backing store per process -- and refuses
before spawning:

    --member-workers 40 does not fit this card: each worker process holds
    its own CUDA context and local-memory backing store, priced at 3038
    MiB, so 40 of them need 121516 MiB against 30994 MiB free. Use
    --member-workers 10 or fewer.

Measured per-process cost is 3151-3236 MiB against 3038 estimated, so
the model and the card agree to about 3%.

## `--no-pool-trim`

Separate from concurrency, and a serial win: the per-step pool trim
costs 0.87 s of a 5.0 s leg (4.99 -> 4.12 s) and is documented
byte-inert -- `free_all_blocks` releases only unused cached blocks. It
is **on by default on Windows**: the 2026-07-17 five-simulated-minute
four-domain A/B found that pool churn drove WDDM page demotion and that
trimming cut wall time by 32%. It held the pool at 21.5-23.4 GiB.
On Linux and other platforms the executor retains the pool by default,
because another process can claim released blocks before the next step.
The run receipt records the resolved platform rule and its reason.
Explicit allocator diagnostic overrides remain available through the
executor's existing `pool_trim_per_period` argument.

## Adoption by the nowcast front door

`tools/da_nowcast.py` is owned elsewhere and is untouched here. When it
wants this, it is one argument passed through to the cycle driver:

    cycle_cmd += ["--member-workers", str(args.member_workers)]

with a matching `--member-workers` on its own parser defaulting to 1.
Nothing else changes: the report's `execution` block records the width
and the trim setting, so the receipt says which arm produced it.

## Accurate limits

- The end-to-end A/B at the full twelve-leg nowcast scale has not been
  measured on an idle card; the card was taken by another job partway
  through. The per-leg throughput figures above are from an idle card
  and are what the speedup claim rests on.
- The identity proof is on the five-trajectory smoke case, not the full
  nowcast. A longer run is a stronger receipt and has not been taken.
- Single-run measurements on a box with no ECC. These are engineering
  numbers, not certification evidence.
- The 1.45x ceiling is a property of this card and WDDM. A Linux box
  with MPS may behave differently and has not been tested.
- **The biggest lever is not in this branch.** Dudhia shortwave is 1.94 s
  of host-side CuPy dispatch, about half a leg. Making that one routine
  issue fewer, larger kernels would beat every arrangement of members
  here. It is a physics-code change needing its own certification.
