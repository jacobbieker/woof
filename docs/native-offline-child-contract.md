# Native offline-child/downscaling contract

This is woof's CUDA-native replacement for the scientific role of WRF
`ndown.exe`. It does not invoke WPS, `real.exe`, `wrf.exe`, or `ndown.exe`.
It is intentionally separate from RW-WPS: RW-WPS starts a forecast from a
large-scale analysis/forecast product, while offline-child starts a new,
standalone child forecast from an archived completed parent simulation.

## Required parent evidence

The preparation transaction must fail before allocating a child unless all of
the following are true:

1. At least two unique, strictly increasing parent states exist.
2. Every state has identical horizontal/vertical geometry, projection, static
   terrain identity, and transported-field inventory.
3. Every state contains `T/U/V/W/PH/PHB/MU/MUB`, dry pressure, water vapor,
   model-top pressure, and the complete active parent microphysics inventory.
4. A companion setup record supplies any base-state, map-factor, static land,
   or surface state omitted from history output. No field is guessed from a
   filename or silently zero-filled.
5. The caller declares a maximum acceptable lateral-boundary interval, and no
   parent interval exceeds it. Hourly d03 history is mechanically readable,
   but it is not accepted for a production 500-m child under a 15-minute
   forcing contract. Five-minute parent archives are preferred for convective
   reruns; 15 minutes is the outer planned default for a 500-m child.
6. The requested child footprint, including the interpolation stencil and
   specified/relaxation frame, is fully covered by the parent.

The current metadata gate lives in `woof.offline_child`. It accepts both
woof and stock-WRF history NetCDF, verifies the invariant grid using a SHA-256
geometry fingerprint, reports an advisory microphysics inventory, and fails
on sparse or irregular forcing. Inventory inference is not authoritative:
the source scheme must be bound from the parent setup/restart/namelist because
WRF history can retain dormant scheme variables.

`bind_parent_physics_from_gpuwm_restart` verifies the restart's resolved
physics fingerprint and binds its domain/config identity. The stock-WRF path
uses `bind_parent_physics_from_wrf_namelist`, binding the chosen domain column
and exact namelist bytes. Production cold-start/LBC builders reject a bare
scheme integer; that lower-level argument remains only for isolated conversion
and interpolation tests.

## Native preparation result

The completed in-memory executable slice currently produces:

- a standalone child initial state using SINT-inherited parent terrain and
  base fields;
- time-varying child lateral value/tendency tables in woof's existing coupled
  WRF units;
- per-frame conversion receipts binding source files, valid times, grid
  placement, interpolation policy, source/target microphysics, and moment
  diagnosis.

The high-resolution static-geography join and compact checksummed on-disk
boundary container are the next publication steps. Until those land, the
receipt explicitly says `sint-parent-inherited`; it does not imply that fine
terrain or land state was synthesized.

Initial and boundary interpolation reuse woof's landed `register_nest`,
`sint`, `bdy_interp1`, and specified-boundary CUDA paths. The child executes as
a standalone specified domain; no live parent model is allocated or stepped.

## Physics-change rules

Changing physics between parent and child is supported only through an
explicit conversion policy. A change starts a new physics trajectory and has
a documented spin-up period; it is not a continuation bit-identical to an
online same-physics nest.

The child clock starts a new standalone forecast. Parent `h_diabatic`, held
radiation/cumulus/PBL tendencies, physics scheduler deadlines, and radiation
averages are not recoverable from ordinary history and are not inherited.
They start through the normal child cold-start policy. A woof restart/setup
companion can supply stronger continuity evidence in a later mode, but an
ordinary history-driven physics change must be interpreted with this spin-up.

A child of a different scheme is converted by the SAME contract and kernel
the live nest edge runs (`woof/core/microphysics_transition.py`:
`resolve_microphysics_transition`, `launch_microphysics_edge_parent_field`),
on the archived parent's own grid BEFORE the horizontal interpolation, for the
initial state and for every boundary frame alike (the boundary frames take the
kernel's coupled form).  Any ordered pair of the schemes that edge ports
(`PORTED_MP_PHYSICS`: Kessler, WSM6, Thompson, Morrison, NSSL, P3,
Milbrandt-Yau, WDM6, aerosol-aware Thompson) converts; the one refusal left
is a microphysics-off end (`offline_cross_scheme_refusal`), which has no
hydrometeor contract online either.

- Shared masses map by physical species; a single rimed category maps by its
  MEANING, read from the parent's bound evidence (`morr_rimed_ice` for
  Morrison, `hail_opt` for WSM6/WDM6) and the child's own config.
- Every target number/volume moment is diagnosed by the target scheme's own
  closure in the kernel (NSSL's calcnfromq, P3's rime-pair entry/exit maps,
  Milbrandt-Yau's mass-to-number block, WDM6's inflow-face seed).
- The parent density the kernel diagnoses against is rebuilt from the
  archive's total geopotential and dry mass with the diagnostics module's own
  expression for the run's `hypsometric_opt`.
- The contract's receipt (species actions, closure constants, source and
  target identity) is written to the run's `report.json` under
  `microphysics_conversion` and into every child restart header under
  `offline_microphysics_conversion`.
- With `--preprocess-backend cpu` the conversion still runs on the GPU, a band
  of parent rows at a time (host to device to host), and the receipt records
  `host_chunked`; the interpolation after it stays on the host.  A machine
  with no usable CUDA device is refused by name for a cross-scheme child.

## Compatibility boundaries

Gpuwm history plus a woof setup/restart archive is the first complete path.
Stock-WRF `wrfout` is a supported compatibility input, but ordinary history
streams frequently omit initialization-only base and surface fields. Such a
stream must be paired with a compatible `wrfinput`/restart/setup record and the
relevant namelist physics identity. The tool fails closed when that companion
state is absent.

This contract does not claim that hourly legacy history can recover sub-hourly
parent evolution. It can build a mechanically valid coarse-forced child only
when the caller explicitly permits that cadence; it cannot manufacture the
missing forcing information.
