## The RFMIP files are not carried

The RFMIP clear-sky input file and its four reference-result files are not
in this directory, in the `gpuwm-data` artifacts or in the source
repository. The tests and the `rfmip_clear_sky` oracle fetch them on demand
from the same rrtmgp-data v1.9 commit, SHA-256 verified
(`gpuwm/core/rfmip_upstream.py` in `gpuwm`, which pins each file's URL,
size and hash):

| Upstream file (under `examples/rfmip-clear-sky/`) | SHA256 | Licence as published |
|---|---|---|
| `inputs/multiple_input4MIPs_radiation_RFMIP_UColorado-RFMIP-1-2_none.nc` | `b8dc05d7cd2e0e6354b4a6198771ddf3bc09f18d72b49f20a41e2024e2fd51f4` | ambiguous CC-BY-4.0 / CC-BY-SA-4.0 (below) |

The reference results restrict reuse to non-commercial purposes, which is
why no WOOF artifact or repository carries them.

## The derived climatology

RRTMGP's column driver needs three things from the input file: the
experiment-zero global-mean mole fraction of each of sixteen well-mixed
gases (times the variable's `units` scale), and the float64 median over the
100 sites of the layer pressure and of the experiment-zero ozone profile.
`rrtmgp-trace-gas-climatology.json` holds exactly those 136 float64 numbers,
derived by `tools/derive_rrtmgp_trace_climatology.py` from the pinned
upstream file, with the source's URL, size and SHA-256 recorded inside it.
JSON keeps every float64 exactly, so the model reads the same numbers it
read when it opened the NetCDF itself. Its own SHA-256
(`71d7f85758fda8cf05df66100ccd0a974fed71216a1b7facad2083bc3dd3b70e`) is pinned
in `gpuwm/core/rfmip_upstream.py`.

Data: University of Colorado, RFMIP atmospheric conditions (CMIP6
input4MIPs, `UColorado-RFMIP-1-2`), via rrtmgp-data v1.9. The derived table
is offered under CC-BY-SA-4.0, the stricter of the two readings of the
source's licence attribute; complying with it also complies with CC-BY-4.0.

## RFMIP input license resolution

The `license` global attribute in the upstream input file is, verbatim:

```text
Atmospheric condition data for RFMIP produced by the University of Colorado is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution "Share Alike" 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). The data producers and data providers make no warranty, either express or implied, including but not limited to, warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. All liabilities arising from the supply of the information (including any liability arising in negligence) are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law.
```

This is genuinely ambiguous: the name `Attribution "Share Alike" 4.0`
describes CC-BY-SA-4.0, while the embedded `/by/4.0/` URL identifies
CC-BY-4.0. Inspection of rrtmgp-data commit
`eff0433faf9cbac3ad14fbf608bef0c26ebc4c79` did not resolve the conflict.
Its root `README.md` and `examples/rfmip-clear-sky/Readme.md` say that the
RFMIP files are unchanged CMIP6/RFMIP copies provided for testing, but give
no file-specific license clarification; the repository's root BSD license
does not resolve the copied file's more-specific embedded attribute. This
distribution therefore does not redistribute the file, and offers the table
derived from it under CC-BY-SA-4.0, which satisfies either reading.

## Floating-point parity policy

- **Working precision:** CUDA parity kernels use FP32. Mirrors, acceptance
  metrics, and host normalization/reductions use float64.
- **FMA policy:** NVRTC's default contraction policy is retained (FMA is
  permitted; no `--fmad=false` override). This is part of the numerical pin
  and may not be changed without re-running the mirror and RFMIP gates.
- **Fast math:** OFF for parity kernels. The loader supplies `-std=c++17`
  only and must not add `--use_fast_math` or equivalent relaxed operations.
- **Reduction order:** each RRTMGP CUDA thread owns one column and accumulates
  layers, g-points, and broadband fluxes in fixed ascending serial order; no
  atomics or parallel tree reductions are used. Solar-spectrum normalization
  and acceptance metrics reduce contiguous host arrays in float64. A change
  in reduction order requires re-pinning the numerical gates.
