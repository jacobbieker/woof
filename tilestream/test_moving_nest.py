"""THE STORM-FOLLOWING MOVING NEST, under each of WOOF's execution modes.

Run it::

    python -m tilestream.test_moving_nest            # the whole matrix
    python -m tilestream.test_moving_nest --probe    # just the UH calibration

WHAT IS UNDER TEST
------------------
A moving nest is two whole-domain reductions and one state swap:

1. :class:`woof.core.storm_tracking.StormTracker` takes a domain-wide
   weighted centroid of the PARENT's ``uh_follow_window`` plane
   (storm_tracking.py:461-474) and proposes a whole-parent-cell shift;
2. :class:`woof.core.relocation_runner.RelocationRunner` RESETS that
   window on the parent state at every evaluation, so the window means
   "strongest rotation since I last looked" and nothing else;
3. :func:`woof.core.nest_relocation.relocate_child` rebuilds the child on
   the new footprint and REPLACES ``node.state``.

All three read or write ``node.state``.  A STREAMED domain's arrays do not
live on ``node.state``: :func:`woof.core.streaming.attach` copies the
carriers into a store (``store="host"`` makes that store pinned host RAM,
which is the entire point of the mode) and every sweep gathers, steps and
scatters THE STORE.  The state object is left behind at the values it held
when it was attached, and nothing in the tree knows that.

So this module runs the SAME two-domain relocation configuration three
ways and compares what the nest actually did:

``resident``          the control: ``steppers = {}``, every domain on
                      ``dycore.step`` itself.
``streamed-device``   d01 streamed with ``store="device"``.  The store IS
                      the state's own arrays (streaming.py:735-738), so
                      this isolates the TILING arithmetic from the
                      TRANSPORT: whatever differs here is not a copy.
``streamed-host``     d01 streamed with ``store="host"`` -- the out-of-core
                      mode, and the one a user turns on.

The comparison is the EXECUTED SHIFT SEQUENCE -- ``(di, dj)`` or ``None``
at every relocation cadence -- plus the carrier digests of both domains at
the end.  A shift sequence is the right observable because it is what the
feature is FOR, it is discrete (so a difference is unambiguous rather than
a tolerance question), and it is a function of the whole parent plane at
every cadence, which is exactly the information a tile cannot see.

WHAT THIS LANE FOUND, IN THE ORDER IT BITES
-------------------------------------------
1. NO PRODUCTION ROUTE CAN TURN STREAMING ON AT ALL.  Both tree routes call
   ``streaming.steppers_for_tree(model, exp.tiles)`` with no builders, so
   ``[tiles] mode = "on"`` refuses at startup with "this route wired no
   streamed-domain builder".  ``[tiles]`` is also a TREE-WIDE block --
   ``ExperimentConfig.tiles``, one options object, no per-domain key --
   so "stream d01, keep d02 resident", which is the only shape a moving nest
   wants, is not expressible.  Both are asserted here as ``route_control``.

2. THE MODEL CLOCK DID NOT REACH THE STREAMED DOMAIN.  ``refresh_model_time``
   makes ``woof.core.clock`` the calendar authority for a resident domain
   and writes a state a streamed one never reads, so a streamed domain ran a
   SECOND free-running clock.  Fixed: ``StreamedDomain.impose_clock``, called
   from ``on_step`` beside ``refresh_model_time``.

3. THE TRACKER'S WINDOW WAS NOT A CARRIER, and the plane it reduces was the
   state's, not the store's.  Fixed: ``physics_inventory
   .STREAMED_ONLY_SCRATCH_SLOTS`` plus ``StreamedDomain.sync_to_state`` /
   ``sync_from_state``, called around the relocation runner and before every
   FORCE.

4. THE STATE SWAP IS STILL A HARD STOP, by design and unchanged.  A
   ``StreamedDomain`` handed a different state refuses; relocation's whole
   job is to hand back a different one.  It does not fire in the tested
   shape (the PARENT is streamed and relocation replaces the CHILD), and it
   fires immediately in the shape ``steppers_for_tree`` actually produces,
   which streams every domain in the tree.

THE CONTROLS
------------
``the isolating control``  ``parent_bitexact``: the SAME parent, alone, no
                           nest and no relocation, resident vs streamed.
                           Without it a d01 difference in the two-domain
                           legs cannot be attributed -- streaming and the
                           executor would both be candidates and neither
                           would be excluded.
``the projection``         each streamed leg runs at ``projection="none"``
                           (as shipped), ``"read-only"`` (reads projected,
                           the reset not pushed back) and ``"full"``.  The
                           first two MUST differ from resident and the third
                           MUST match; a one-sided assertion would pass on a
                           domain that happened not to move.
``the state swap``         ``StreamingRefused`` is provoked and its message
                           quoted rather than paraphrased.
``physics fired``          radiation / cumulus / PBL / LSM call counts are
                           printed for BOTH sides of every comparison, and
                           for a streamed domain they are read from the
                           SWEEP's scalar carriers -- the state's driver
                           holds only the warmup step, which is how a census
                           can say "radiation fired once" about a run in
                           which it fired nine times.

WHY A SEEDED STATE AND NOT A WK82 SUPERCELL
-------------------------------------------
``tilestream/REAL-DATA.md``'s argument, and one extra reason specific to
this lane.  The WK82 quarter-shear case is the natural moving-nest case,
but it runs on OPEN lateral boundaries, and ``dycore.step`` applies the
Klemp-Wilhelmson radiative condition at the WINDOW's edges
(dycore.py:2048-2125, called at :2384) -- so every interior seam of every
tile would take a radiative boundary condition, which no halo can undo.
Streaming has been proven bit-exact on PERIODIC and on SPECIFIED domains
and on neither open one; running the moving nest on an open-boundary
parent would measure that gap instead of this feature.  The configuration
here is the one the join gate proved: specified lateral boundaries, a real
Lambert projection, real terrain, moist physics -- with
``nwp_diagnostics = 1`` added, which no tilestream configuration has ever
carried before, because that is the switch that makes the UH accumulator
exist at all.
