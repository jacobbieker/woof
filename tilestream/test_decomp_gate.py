"""The slice gate: a decomposed initial condition IS the monolithic one.

Three questions, in the order that makes a failure diagnosable:

1. **Is the plan a decomposition?**  Every point of the domain owned by
   exactly one rank, every rank the same shape.  Cheap, and it fails first
   when the geometry is wrong, so the later failures are never geometry.

2. **Is the slice bit-identical to the monolithic state?**  Build the domain
   once, slice it into ``py*px`` rank windows, scatter the rank INTERIORS back
   and compare the bit patterns.  This is the test that actually proves the
   slice, it needs one card, and it does not care what the numbers are -- so
   it runs on the analytic builder as well as on a real analysis, and a pass
   on the analytic builder is a pass for the transport.

   Compared on bits rather than with a tolerance on purpose.  An off-by-one in
   a smooth field is CLOSE everywhere; ``allclose`` is exactly the instrument
   that cannot see it.

3. **Is the initial condition continuous across the seams?**  Only meaningful
   on a state with horizontal structure, so the geography rung is the one that
   answers it: mean |first difference| across the rank boundaries against the
   same statistic away from them.  A ratio of many times 1 means the slice put
   the wrong rows next to each other.

WHICH CARD EACH RANK IS BUILT ON.  ``DEVICES`` is the same contract
:mod:`tilestream.test_seam_gate` already uses, and it defaults to card 0 for
every rank, which is what this gate has always done.  The slice is a property
of the geometry, so one card gates it completely -- but a run on one card
cannot answer the separate question of whether the reassembly survives a
PHYSICAL device boundary, because there is not one in it.  ``DEVICES=0,1``
round-robins the rank buffers over the cards listed, so rank ``r`` is
allocated, sliced into and read back on ``devices[r % len(devices)]`` and the
gather crosses real card boundaries.

The transfer path is named rather than assumed.  Every rank's arrays come back
through ``cupy.ndarray.get`` -- device-to-host into this process's memory, then
compared on the host -- so the crossing is STAGED THROUGH HOST by construction
and no peer link is involved even where the hardware has one.  That is the
accurate description of what this gate exercises; the peer-vs-staged question on
the SEAM transport belongs to :mod:`tilestream.multigpu`, which chooses between
them.
