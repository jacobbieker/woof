"""The measurement that decides what can be reclaimed, and from whom.

Run it::

    python -m tilestream.vram_probe attribute --rung full+MYNN+Noah-MP
    python -m tilestream.vram_probe buffers   --rung full+MYNN+Noah-MP -k 3
    python -m tilestream.vram_probe scaling   --rung full+MYNN+Noah-MP

Three questions, in the order they have to be answered.

1. ATTRIBUTE.  ``attribute`` arms a :class:`tilestream.vram.DeviceLedger`
   before the first CuPy call and walks one full+MYNN+Noah-MP buffer through
   its whole life -- vertical coordinate, ``init_at_rest``, physics
   initialisation, the first step (which fires radiation, cumulus and the
   surface/PBL stack because WRF's cadence predicates are all true at
   ``itimestep == 1``), then steady steps, then a FORCED radiation firing at
   the production cadence.  Every pooled allocation is charged to the source
   line that asked for it.  A category cannot be freed; a line can.

2. PER-PROCESS OR PER-BUFFER.  ``buffers`` builds K identical buffers one
   after another and reports each one's marginal cost.  Buffer 1 pays for
   everything a process pays for exactly once -- the RRTMGP k-distribution
   tables, the cloud-optics tables, the NVRTC module images, the CUDA
   context -- and buffers 2..K pay only for what genuinely scales with the
   number of buffers.  This is the number that decides whether ``nbuffers=2``
   is affordable on a 12 GB card, and nothing in the project had measured
   it.

3. SCALE.  ``scaling`` repeats the buffer measurement at several domain
   sizes and least-squares fits ``bytes = fixed + per_cell * cells``, then
   reports the largest domain that fits a stated budget.  The fit is
   reported with its residuals: a fixed term that is really a per-cell term
   in disguise shows up as a systematic residual, and quoting the intercept
   of a bad fit as "the fixed cost" is exactly the mistake this workstream
   was created to stop repeating.

WHY THE CLOCK IS PUSHED FORWARD FOR THE RADIATION MEASUREMENT
------------------------------------------------------------
At ``radt = 12 min`` and ``dt = 3 s`` radiation fires on step 1 and then not
again until step 241.  Running 240 steps to see the second firing costs
minutes per configuration and measures nothing new about ALLOCATION, whose
shapes are functions of ``(ncol, nz, ngpt)`` and not of the trajectory.  So
the probe sets ``state.elapsed_seconds = stepra * dt`` through
``physics_inventory.set_carrier_scalars`` -- the same setter the tiled driver
uses to keep every tile on the domain's clock -- which makes the next step's
``itimestep`` satisfy ``itimestep % stepra == 1``.  The probe PRINTS
``driver.call_counts`` before and after every window it measures, so a window
where radiation did not actually fire is visible rather than assumed.
