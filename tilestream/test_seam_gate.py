"""The hardened seam gate: a gate that COULD have caught the ``mup`` bug.

The 154 Mcell imagery shipped with a real seam in surface pressure and a
bit-exactness gate that was green the whole time.  Neither statement was a
lie; they were about different exchange sets, and the green one was also taken
on a horizontally uniform state over three steps.
:doc:`tilestream/SEAM-IN-SURFACE-PRESSURE.md` has the full mechanism.  This
module is the instrument that fixes the gate, and it is built so that the
question "does this gate actually discriminate?" is answered by the gate
itself rather than asserted in a docstring.

THE THREE THINGS THE OLD GATE LACKED, each an independent axis here
-------------------------------------------------------------------

``ic``
    ``uniform``   horizontally uniform, vertically structured -- what the old
                  gate ran.  Every column identical, so a stale halo holds the
                  same bits as a fresh one.  **Such a gate cannot detect an
                  exchange omission in principle**, whatever carriers it
                  covers, and this module proves that rather than repeating it.

    ``perturbed`` a SMOOTH perturbation that is a function of GLOBAL ``(j, i)``
                  and is then SLICED per rank by ``load_from_host``.  Global
                  indexing is not a detail: all ranks have identical local
                  shapes, so a rank-local draw gives every rank the same tile
                  and builds hard seams into the initial condition.  Smooth,
                  not white: white noise puts all its variance at 2*dx*, which
                  is both physically wrong (it drove psfc to ~1250 hPa and
                  killed a run inside RRTMGP) and the one spectrum a seam can
                  hide in.

``steps``
    The old digest ran **three** steps.  A stale halo has to propagate inward
    before it reaches a cell the scatter keeps, so duration is a real axis and
    is swept, not assumed.

``field``
    A seam check on a SMOOTH field.  ``mup`` is the dycore's prognostic column
    dry mass -- the surface pressure -- and ``p[0]`` is the diagnosed pressure
    at the lowest model level.  Reflectivity was clean at 0.63-0.93 through the
    entire seam episode because a seam hides in a noisy field and cannot hide
    in a smooth one.

WHAT IS ON TRIAL
----------------

``exchange``
    ``ndim>=3``   the set the 154 Mcell runner used: three-dimensional
                  carriers only.  In this inventory that drops exactly one
                  array, ``mup`` -- the same "one 12.6 MB plane, 73 -> 74
                  arrays" the fix costs at production size.
    ``namespace`` every 3-D carrier PLUS the whole dynamics ``state/``
                  namespace whatever its rank.  The fix.  Rank conflates
                  column-local physics with horizontally-coupled dynamics
                  prognostics; namespace does not.

``tile_mup``
    The second, stacked defect: ``mup`` was also RANK-TILED -- the initialiser
    regenerated only ``thp`` and ``w`` from global indices, so every rank held
    an identical copy at t=0 *and* never exchanged it.  Reproduced here by
    overwriting each rank's ``mup`` with rank 0's window after the slice.
