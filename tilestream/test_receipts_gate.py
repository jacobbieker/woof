"""The receipts gate: a domain-wide FP64 sum, taken from a domain that is
not on the card.

``dycore.domain_mass_measure`` is an FP64 area-weighted sum of ``mu/msft**2``
over the whole domain and it is the number WOOF's conservation closure is
built on.  It is a RECEIPT, not a carrier -- nothing in the forecast reads it
-- which is exactly why it needs a gate of its own: a carrier that goes wrong
changes the answer and the bit-exactness matrix catches it, and a receipt that
goes wrong changes nothing except what the operator believes.

WHAT THIS GATE ASSERTS, IN TWO PARTS THAT ARE DELIBERATELY NOT THE SAME CLAIM
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) The receipt taken from the pinned store in the MONOLITHIC traversal order
    is BIT-IDENTICAL to the resident run's.  Asserted.

(b) The same receipt FOLDED per tile is reported with its exact ulp distance
    from (a) and is NOT asserted equal.  Published as data, because it is
    data: floating-point summation is not associative and 16 partial sums
    rounded then added is a different rounding from one sum of 49152 terms.

The two rows of (b) are the reason this gate runs two configurations rather
than one.  On the milestone-one periodic domain the fold is 0 ulp -- and that
zero is a TRAP.  ``msft == 1`` exactly there, so the area weight is exactly
1.0, every term is an FP32 column mass (a multiple of 2**-7 near 65000), and
the 49152-term sum needs 39 of FP64's 53 bits.  It is EXACT, so no
association can move it.  A gate that ran only that configuration would
publish "0 ulp, folding is fine" and be wrong the first time anybody pointed
it at a real projection.  The mapped case is where the question has an
answer.

THE CONTROLS
------------
Every one of these fails when the thing it guards is broken, and each was
observed FIRING before its fix:

* the receipt read from ``state`` on the streamed leg must be GROSSLY wrong
  -- it is the t=0 mass, because a streamed domain's state is never stepped
  again.  MEASURED 376832 ulp from the truth after 24 steps;
* the receipt folded over GATHERED windows (what a tile-local observer that
  simply called ``domain_mass_measure(tile_state)`` returns) must come back
  at the plan's redundancy, 2.5x;
* ``step_kwargs`` must reach ``dycore.step``.  ``TiledRun.sweep`` documented
  that it did and did not do it, so every keyword WOOF's run loop hands a
  streamed domain was silently unset.  The control sweeps with
  ``acoustic=False`` and demands a DIFFERENT answer from the default sweep;
* ``mass_flux_observer`` and ``mass_flux_accumulator`` must be REFUSED by a
  sweep, because a tile can only offer its own window's faces;
* ``tilestream.receipts.tke_budget`` must REFUSE, and the naive
  sum-over-buffers fold is printed beside the resident answer so the size of
  the lie is on the record.
