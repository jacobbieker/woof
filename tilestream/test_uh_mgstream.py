"""The same three accumulators, streamed across N GPUs out of ONE host store.

:mod:`tilestream.mgstream` shares the tiles of a single pinned host domain out
over several GPUs.  Nothing about the running maxima is device-aware -- the
fold happens in a tile buffer and the result is scattered into the store like
any other carrier -- so the multi-GPU question here is narrow and worth asking
precisely:

1.  do the accumulators survive the PARTITION?  Two workers walk the tile list
    in a different order from one, and ``write_mode="shadow"`` gives them two
    stores and one barrier while ``write_mode="ring"`` gives them a Gauss-
    Seidel dependency chain that crosses devices.  A running max is
    order-independent as arithmetic (max is associative and commutative) but
    the transport underneath it is not, and an accumulator that is gathered
    from the wrong generation of the store is wrong in a way no amount of
    associativity fixes.
2.  is the RESET still transport-agnostic?  ``mgstream`` is a store-sweeping
    function with no seam of its own -- it is handed a store and never sees a
    ``DomainState`` -- so a run loop driving it has to bind the store where
    the model's reset can find it, exactly as ``streaming.attach`` does for
    the single-GPU seam.  This module binds it the same way and calls the
    MODEL's ``reset_up_heli_max`` / ``reset_tracker_window``, so what is
    tested is the shipped API and not a store-aware stand-in.

``devices=(0,)`` and ``devices=(0, 0)`` are the two configurations that
separate "the partition is wrong" from "two physical GPUs interfere", and both
run on any box.  ``--devices 0,1`` runs the real two-card case when a
multi-GPU box is free.

    python -m tilestream.test_uh_mgstream                # 1 worker + 2 workers
    python -m tilestream.test_uh_mgstream --devices 0,1  # two real cards

#: Smaller than the single-GPU gate's geometry because every ``run_mgstream``

#: still tiles with no true edge and tiles with two.

NSTEPS = 12

#: OPEN lateral boundaries, not SPECIFIED, and that is a finding rather than a
#: convenience.  ``update_up_heli_max`` needs non-periodic boundary handling on
#: BOTH axes -- specified/nested, or open-x AND open-y -- so a periodic domain
#: cannot run this diagnostic at all.  Of the two legal choices only OPEN is
#: reachable here: ``run_mgstream`` has no ``tile_hook`` parameter, so it has
#: nowhere to attach a tile's windowed lateral-boundary tables, and a
#: specified-BC domain streamed through it would give every tile the SAME
#: tables -- which is the single-GPU lane's "boundary tables not windowed"
#: negative control, i.e. a known-wrong run.  That gap is mgstream's, not this
#: diagnostic's: the module predates the per-tile boundary work.  Open BCs need
#: no tables, so the accumulators can be tested across devices today and the
#: specified-BC multi-GPU case is reported as NOT TESTED.
OPEN_BC = dict(specified=False, open_x=True, open_y=True, nested=False)

#: FLAT, and that is also forced rather than chosen.  ``dycore.step`` REFUSES
#: ``terrain_opt=1`` together with open boundaries outright -- "set_w_surface
#: and the advance_w_phi kinematic surface BC difference ht with unconditional
#: periodic wraps, which would couple the two open boundaries through the
#: terrain slope" -- so the only geography this lane can carry is the
#: PROJECTION.  That is still horizontally varying and still the thing a tile
#: would get wrong if it rebuilt it: map factors, Coriolis, the rotation angle
#: and every scheme's latitude/longitude grid.  Real TERRAIN under multi-GPU
#: streaming is reported as NOT TESTED, and it is untestable here for a reason
#: that has nothing to do with this diagnostic.
