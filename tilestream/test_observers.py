"""THE SAFETY OBSERVERS UNDER STREAMING: they watch a corpse.

``woof.runtime.integrate_prepared_case`` guards a forecast with three
whole-domain observers, and all three are handed ``state``::

    stepper(state, integration_cfg, **step_kwargs)          # runtime.py
    ...
    health.require_healthy(phase=...)                       # every 4th substep
    report = stability_report(state, integration_cfg, boundary_width=width)
    ...
    if not nan_free:
        raise RuntimeError("real-case integration produced a non-finite ...")
    ...
    step_swdown_peak = float(cp.max(state.physics.fields["swdown"]))

``woof.core.model.execute_experiment`` does the same with
``StateHealthValidator(node.state)``.

Under ``[tiles] store = "host"`` -- the out-of-core mode, the whole point
of the feature -- ``state`` is NOT where the domain lives.
:func:`woof.core.streaming.attach` builds the store with::

    store = {name: _gather.pinned_copy(arr) for name, arr in live.items()}

``pinned_copy`` COPIES.  From that instant the domain is the store, the sweep
gathers tiles out of it and scatters interiors back into it, and the
``DomainState`` the observers hold is a snapshot of t=0 that nothing ever
writes again.  (With ``store = "device"`` the seam does ``store = live`` --
the same arrays -- so the observers are correct there, and the difference
between the two is the whole finding.)

WHY THIS IS THE WORST POSSIBLE SHAPE FOR A DEFECT
-------------------------------------------------
The observers are pure -- they carry nothing into the answer -- so a wrong
reading cannot change a single bit of the forecast, which is exactly why
nothing caught it.  What it changes is whether the run is GUARDED.  The
snapshot is healthy at t=0, so:

* ``nan_free`` stays ``True`` forever and the ``RuntimeError`` never fires;
* ``w_max``/``boundary_w_max``/``interior_w_max`` freeze at the t=0 values
  and are written into every restart checkpoint's ``run_trackers`` as
  though they were the run's;
* ``swdown_peak`` freezes at the t=0 peak;
* ``StateHealthValidator.require_healthy`` passes on a state that has not
  moved.

A domain that went non-finite in the store therefore completes
"successfully", writes its history frames and writes a checkpoint that
records ``nan_free: true``.  A silently disarmed NaN guard is
indistinguishable from a well-behaved forecast.  And it is not free: the
two-stage device reduction over u/w/thp runs EVERY substep on data nobody
is using, so the mode pays a real per-substep tax for an answer that is
wrong.

WHAT THIS MODULE MEASURES
-------------------------
Nine legs at dx 3 km, full physics + Kain-Fritsch (mp10, YSU, Noah, RRTMGP,
KF), a real Lambert projection, real terrain and SPECIFIED lateral
boundaries, in three sets of three.  Every set runs resident, streamed as
shipped, and streamed with the fold, from the same seed and the same
boundary tables, so the only difference inside a set is which memory the
observers read.

``blowup-*``   dt 18 s, 60 steps.  A GENUINE blow-up, not an injection:
               :func:`stability_ladder` measured this harness's initial
               condition going non-finite at dt 18 s on a 3 km grid, and the
               resident run raises the run loop's own ``RuntimeError`` when
               it does.  This is the narrative the defect is about -- a
               domain that blew up in the store -- with nothing put there by
               hand, so no argument about whether the poison was fair can
               reach it.
``*-clean``    dt 12 s, 200 steps, which the same ladder measured stable.
               The reading: the streamed run's reported ``w_max`` must equal
               the resident run's to the last bit, substep by substep.  The
               store's TRUE per-step ``w_max`` is folded on the host as a
               third trace, so the record shows both what the observer SAID
               and what was actually happening.
``*-poisoned`` dt 12 s, 200 steps, one cell of the STORE set to NaN at
               substep 50.  Kept even though the blow-up set is stronger,
               because it separates "the domain went bad" from "one cell of
               the store went bad" -- and because its resident leg exposed
               something worth knowing (see :func:`classify_guard`).

200 steps at dt 12 s is 40 forecast minutes, so radiation (radt 12 min =
every 60 steps) fires 4 times and cumulus (cudt 5 min = every 25 steps) 9
times INSIDE every window, on BOTH sides.  Those counts are PRINTED for
every leg, because three of this project's six false results were the same
mistake: a number measured in a window where radiation and cumulus never
fired.  The 60-step blow-up legs are shorter than a radiation period on
purpose -- they are a correctness gate and nothing timed is quoted from them.

Every leg also reports the per-substep wall cost of ``stability_report`` and
of ``StateHealthValidator.require_healthy``, so the fold can be priced
against what it replaces.

    python -m tilestream.test_observers --verdict obs/*.json
    python -m tilestream.test_observers --ladder 18 12 9 6 --nx 336

WHAT IS FIXED HERE AND WHAT IS NOT
----------------------------------
The stability record IS folded (``woof.core.streaming.StreamedStability``,
``woof/core/kernels/health_tile.cu``), and so are ``swdown``'s peak and the
physics call counters, which were reading the same corpse.
``StateHealthValidator`` is NOT: it is a descriptor kernel over up to 1024
whole fields with no windowing, so it cannot be aimed at a tile's interior,
and the foldable form -- validating each buffer after its gather and before
its step -- observes the domain one step behind and multiplies the launch by
the tile count.  Under a host store that validator still inspects the t=0
snapshot.  It is said here and in the run loop rather than left to be
discovered.

#: Set A is a GENUINE blow-up, not an injection: the ladder measured this
#: harness's initial condition going non-finite at dt = 18 s on a 3 km grid,
#: and the resident run raises the run loop's own
#: ``RuntimeError("...produced a non-finite state at...")`` when it does.
#: That is exactly the narrative the defect is about -- a domain that blew up
#: in the store -- with nothing injected by hand, so no argument about
#: whether the poison was fair can reach it.
#:
#: Set B is the same configuration at a dt the ladder measured stable, for
#: the READING: the streamed run's reported w_max must equal the resident
#: run's to the last bit.
#:
#: Set C is the surgical poison of the brief.  It is kept even though set A
#: is the stronger evidence, because it separates "the domain went bad" from
#: "one cell of the STORE went bad", and because its resident leg exposed
#: something worth knowing: a poisoned ``state.w`` dies in

    A dry, seeded domain small enough to fit beside anything -- MEASURED

    waiting for a card that has room for a forecast.  The physics rungs are
    proven by the suite; what this proves is the reduction itself, including
    the two things a per-tile fold can get wrong and still look right:
    the DOMAIN flat index behind ``w_argmax`` and the DOMAIN boundary cut
    behind ``boundary_w_max``.

    Three controls, each of which must fire:

    ``window="buffer"``   fold each tile's whole gathered window instead of
                          its interior.  The obvious implementation.  The
                          halo was stepped with insufficient neighbours, so
                          it reports maxima the domain never had.
    ``a skipped tile``    read the record after ``begin_sweep`` with tiles
                          missing -- must REFUSE, because a stale record
                          folded in with current ones looks healthy.
