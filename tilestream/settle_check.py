"""Does the monolithic settling step change WHICH carriers exist?

``build_stores`` runs one full-domain ``dycore.step`` before it takes the
carrier manifest, because two carriers are allocated lazily on first use --
Kain-Fritsch's ``cumulus/w0avg`` above all.  Past the resident ceiling that
step is exactly what does not fit, so ``settle=False`` skips it.  This is the
control that says what skipping it costs, on a domain small enough that both
answers can be had:

    python -m tilestream.settle_check --config CFG

It prints the carrier-name set and the wrfout frame-plan field set BEFORE and
AFTER the step and diffs them.  An empty diff means the manifest a streamed
run builds without the step is the manifest it would have built with it.  A
non-empty diff names the carriers a ``settle=False`` run of THAT
configuration would be missing -- and is the reason ``run_tiled`` compares
inventories and refuses rather than trusting this result to generalise.
