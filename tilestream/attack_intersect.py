"""STRUCTURAL ATTACK 1: is any STREAMED CARRIER also an ARENA SLOT?

The sharing scheme's whole safety argument is that the arena holds only
step-local scratch -- written before read inside one step, dead at the tile
boundary.  But ``physics_inventory.carrier_inventory`` streams a set of
``scratch/*`` slots too (that is why forcing ``mp_rainnc`` into the arena is
a valid negative control).  If ANY name is in both sets, then the gather
writes a buffer whose storage every tile shares, and the scheme is wrong for
a reason no answer-watching control is guaranteed to catch.

This asks the question directly instead of trusting the audit table.
