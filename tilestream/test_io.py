"""THE I/O GATE: a streamed forecast must WRITE and RESUME like a resident one.

Run it::

    python -m tilestream.test_io              # from the repository root

:mod:`tilestream.test_gate` proves the streamed trajectory equals the
monolithic one.  That is necessary and it is not sufficient: a forecast that
cannot write a wrfout is not a forecast, and a forecast that cannot be
resumed is not a forecast either.  This file proves both, and it proves them
the only way that means anything -- by comparing BYTES against the resident
path that already works, and by asserting that each comparison FAILS when the
thing it tests is broken.

WHAT IS UNDER TEST
------------------
``tilestream.output``
    A wrfout frame built with no device traffic at all, out of the pinned
    host store plus the domain's setup.  Compared field by field and then
    file by file against ``woof.io.wrfout._device_state_frame`` on the
    resident state, at four physics rungs.

``tilestream.checkpoint``
    A v5 woof restart written out of the same store, and read back into a
    fresh one.  Compared header-key by header-key and member by member
    against ``restart.write_restart``, then round-tripped four ways.

THE FOUR LEGS OF THE ROUND TRIP
-------------------------------
One reference -- ``N + M`` uninterrupted monolithic steps -- and four ways to
reach it.  Nothing here would be proved by streamed->streamed alone: two
copies of the same mistake agree with each other.

======================  ==============================================
leg                     what it would catch that the others would not
======================  ==============================================
streamed, N + M         the streaming loop itself (already gated, run
                        here so a checkpoint failure cannot hide behind
                        a streaming failure)
streamed N, restart,    the checkpoint round trip inside one lane
streamed M
streamed N, restart,    the file really is a woof restart: an
MONOLITHIC M            unmodified ``restore_restart`` reads it into a
                        resident state and continues the trajectory
monolithic N, restart,  the reader really validates: a checkpoint the
streamed M              resident path wrote resumes a streamed run
======================  ==============================================

THE NEGATIVE CONTROLS, AND WHY EACH ONE EXISTS
-----------------------------------------------
* ``negative_reassociated_t`` -- ``thp + (thb - 300)`` instead of
  ``(thb + thp) - 300``.  Float addition is not associative, and this is the
  obvious way to write the host derive.  Running it turned up something
  §12.1 did not say: the difference is 26.2% of T's bytes on a freshly
  seeded state and EXACTLY ZERO after one ``dycore.step``, because a stepped
  ``thp`` is 100.00% on the ulp(300) representable grid.  The control has to
  run unwarmed, and it reports the whole matrix so that is visible.
* ``negative_field_order`` -- the same fields in a different order.  Every
  variable compares equal and the FILE is different, which is the trap the
  "compare checksums, not bytes" advice exists for.
* ``negative_tile_fingerprint`` -- a checkpoint whose ``setup_fingerprint``
  was computed from a TILE state.  This is the dangerous one: a monolithic
  resume refuses it (fail closed), but a streamed resume that made the same
  mistake ACCEPTS it -- so the fingerprint silently stops protecting against
  resuming onto different terrain, a different projection or a different base
  state.  The control asserts both halves.
* ``negative_tile_physics_identity`` -- the same, one level down: the
  resolved physics identity taken from a tile driver without substituting the
  DOMAIN's radiation lat/lon grid.
* ``negative_partial_inventory`` -- a checkpoint carrying only ``state/*``,
  which is milestone one's inventory.  ``read_store_restart`` must refuse it
  rather than resume with dirty ``scratch/``, ``driver/`` and ``fields/``
  carriers.
* ``negative_dropped_scalars`` -- resume without ``elapsed_seconds``, and
  resume without the driver call counts and ``microphysics_updates``.  Run at
  ``full fast cadence`` ON PURPOSE: at the long-cadence rungs eight steps of
  3 s never reach a cadence boundary, so the same defect is invisible there.
  The control runs at both and prints both, so the reader can see the cheap
  configuration certifying the bug.
* ``case_diagnostic_scatter`` -- the positive half proves each tile computes
  its own ``OLR`` window correctly and the scatter assembles it bit-exactly;
  the negative half publishes the tile BUFFER after the sweep, which is what
  a naive implementation does, and it is the last tile's values over the
  whole domain.

    """The one class of diagnostic that is NOT a per-cell function: reductions.

    ``woof/runtime.py:2262`` puts five WHOLE-DOMAIN reductions in every
    checkpoint's ``run_trackers`` -- ``w_max_ms``, its boundary/interior
    split, ``swdown_peak_wm2`` and the ``nan_free`` flag -- and every one of
    them is a ``cp.max``/any over the full field.  A tile's answer is not the
    domain's answer, so they must be REDUCED across tiles rather than read off
    whichever tile was last in the buffer.

    Two ways to do that and only one of them works, which is what this
    measures:

    ``over tile INTERIORS``
        BIT-EXACT for MAX (and for ANY): the interiors partition the domain
        and max is associative in the exact sense.  NOT bit-exact for a SUM,
        and this is the part worth knowing -- folding per-tile partial sums
        changes the summation ORDER, and float addition is not associative,
        so the answer agrees to rounding and never to the byte.  MEASURED
        below as a relative error.
    ``over tile COMPUTE WINDOWS`` (interior + halo)
        still exact for MAX and ANY, because they are idempotent and a halo
        cell counted twice is a cell counted once; WRONG for a sum, a mean or
        a count by exactly the halo redundancy -- MEASURED here as a factor
        of 5.6 at halo 16 with 24x32 tiles, which is the same
        ``(T + 2*halo)^2 / T^2`` the tiling tax is quoted in.

    So the rule for a streamed run: idempotent reductions may be folded from
    the tile BUFFER and are bit-exact; additive ones must be folded from the
    INTERIOR window and are still only exact to rounding.  Nothing in a
    wrfout FRAME is a reduction -- every field there is pointwise,
    column-local, or a short horizontal stencil -- so this constrains the run
    summary and the checkpoint header, not history output.
