"""Bitwise round-trip tests for tilestream.gather.

Run directly (``python -m tilestream.test_gather``) or under pytest.

WHAT IS BEING PROVEN
--------------------
1. DEVICE ROUND TRIP -- fill a full-domain state with unique values, gather
   every tile, scatter every interior back into a ZEROED sink, and require the
   sink to equal the source bitwise, for every field in the persisted
   inventory.  Scattering into a zeroed sink (rather than back over the
   source) is deliberate: it makes an un-copied cell show up as a mismatch
   instead of being masked by the value that was already there.  A gather that
   silently moved nothing cannot pass.
2. HOST ROUND TRIP -- the same, with a PINNED host store on the domain side,
   exercising the real H2D/D2H path rather than D2D.
3. ALL 47 NAMES -- a synthetic store carrying every name in
   ``STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS`` at its true stagger, including the 2-D
   ``(ny, nx)`` surface fields (``mup``, ``nwfa2d``, ``nifa2d``) and the
   ``(nz+1, ny, nx)`` vertical-face fields (``w``, ``php``).  A dry
   milestone-one ``DomainState`` only allocates 9 of the 47, so the real-state
   tests above cannot cover the rest; this one does.  The count is pinned
   exactly and moves only together with a per-field justification -- see
   ``NEW_SINCE_41`` at the test.
4. STAGGERED PLACEMENT -- a gathered ``u`` tile is compared against the
   directly-indexed slice of the full ``u`` array, so an off-by-one in the
   x-face treatment fails loudly instead of hiding inside a round trip that is
   self-consistently wrong.

Both a ``cupy.array_equal`` comparison and a SHA-256 over the raw bytes are
required to pass.  ``array_equal`` alone would call NaN != NaN a failure and
+0.0 == -0.0 a success; the byte hash has neither problem, and disagreeing
answers from the two would itself be informative.

THE PERIODIC STAGGERED-DUPLICATE INVARIANT
------------------------------------------
"Fill with unique values" cannot be taken literally for ``u`` and ``v`` on a
periodic domain.  ``u`` has ``nx+1`` faces for ``nx`` mass columns and face
``nx`` IS face ``0``; likewise ``v`` row ``ny`` is row ``0``.  woof's own
seeding enforces exactly this (harness.py:_SEED_FIELDS marks ``u`` x-duplicate
and ``v`` y-duplicate, copied from npref.py:2284).  ``_fill_unique`` below
therefore assigns a distinct value to every element and then re-imposes the
duplicate, and ``test_duplicate_invariant_is_load_bearing`` demonstrates that
without it the round trip genuinely fails -- so the invariant is stated and
checked, not assumed.

TWO INDEPENDENT SPECS
---------------------
``tilestream/spec.py`` is owned by another agent.  It was not on disk when
these tests were written, so ``_LocalTileSpec`` / ``plan_tiles`` below are a
minimal stand-in implementing the agreed contract; they live HERE and are
never imported by ``gather.py``.  ``spec.py`` has since landed, and every
round trip now runs against BOTH -- the real module and the stand-in -- via
``SPEC_PROVIDERS``.  That is deliberate: the two disagree on details
(the stand-in expresses segments as ``(src, dst)`` pairs while
``spec.Transfer`` names its sides ``full``/``tile``; they pick different tiles
to own the periodic alias slot ``u[..., nx]``), so passing both shows
``gather.py`` is driven by the geometry rather than co-tuned to one
implementation's quirks.
