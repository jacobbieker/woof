"""wrfout history for a streamed REAL case, so ``woof render`` can render it.

``tilestream/RENDERING.md`` is unambiguous: ``woof render --engine rust`` is
the product tier, it reads **wrfout NetCDF**, and nothing else should be
hand-rolled.  :mod:`tilestream.output` already writes a wrfout frame straight
out of the pinned host store with no device traffic.  What that module cannot
know is a REAL case's identity -- the Lambert projection globals, the
curvilinear XLAT/XLONG the renderer takes its extent from, the land mask, and
``REFL_10CM``, which is a driver diagnostic rather than a carrier and so is
not in the store at all.

This module supplies exactly those four things and nothing else:

``globals``
    :func:`woof.runtime._global_wrf_attrs` verbatim -- the same call
    ``runtime.write_case_output`` makes for a resident run, off the same
    ``prepared.grid`` / ``geog_selection`` / vertical coordinate.  A streamed
    file and a resident one therefore carry the same projection block, which
    is what makes the renderer treat them identically.

``metadata``
    :func:`woof.runtime._metadata_frame` verbatim: XLAT/XLONG and their U/V
    stagger, map factors, Coriolis, SINALPHA/COSALPHA (without which the
    renderer degrades the 10 m wind panel to grid-relative), HGT, LANDMASK,
    LU_INDEX.  All of it is grid geometry, computed once.

``REFL_10CM``
    :func:`tilestream.realcase.reflectivity_3d` -- ``woof.core.refl``'s own
    diagnostic, run over the host store by row slabs because reflectivity is
    column-local.  It is a MODEL field, not radar.

``the cadence discipline``
    :meth:`tilestream.output.StoreFrame.fields` must be called at a sweep
    boundary or the frame mixes generations.  :meth:`History.write` is only
    ever called between ``run_tiled`` calls, and it says so.

#: The volumetric fields a frame keeps.  A FULL frame at this rung is 272
#: B/mass cell -- 12.3 GiB at 960x960x49 -- so writing every carrier every
#: half hour is 300 GiB of disk for one 12 h forecast, and the box has 149.
#: These are the ones ``woof render``'s products are actually computed from:
#: ``wrf.getvar`` builds pressure from ``P + PB``, height from ``PH + PHB``,
#: temperature from ``T``, moisture from ``QVAPOR``, the wind suite from
#: ``U``/``V``/``W``, the hydrometeor and cloud panels from the mixing
#: ratios, and composite reflectivity is the column maximum of ``REFL_10CM``.
#: Everything smaller than :data:`SMALL_FIELD_BYTES` is kept regardless --
#: that is every 2-D surface field and the soil column -- so the surface and
#: severe suites lose nothing.  What IS lost is named in the run log by
#: :meth:`History.write`, because a silently thinned file would let a reader
#: conclude a product is unsupported by the model rather than absent here.
