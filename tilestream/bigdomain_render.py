"""Figures from a streamed big-domain forecast.

DEPRECATED FALLBACK, under the project render law ( 2026-08-06):
weather-field product plots come from the real Rust renderer
``rw_wrfbatch`` driven through :mod:`woof.rustwx`.  This module's
matplotlib panels are the fallback, reachable only with
``--engine matplotlib``, and they are not the product tier.

The premise this file was written on is gone.  It said the production
renderer "cannot be pointed at a pinned host store, so it is not the tool
for a domain that never becomes a wrfout" -- and the domain DOES become a
wrfout now: ``tilestream/run_bigdomain.py`` writes one beside every
``.npz`` by default (``woof.io.surface_wrfout``), and ``--engine rust``
here materialises one from any older ``.npz`` that predates that.
MEASURED 2026-08-17 on a 256x256x33 streamed forecast: 20 production
products per frame through the real executable, the reflectivity on the
NWS ladder the panels below imitate.

What the Rust route does NOT yet draw, and why it is not a silent second
tier: the SIX-PANEL SHEET, the evolution STRIP, the zoom crop and the
tile-seam overlay are multi-panel COMPOSITION, and ``MapRenderRequest``
composes one panel.  Composition of finished PNGs is
:mod:`woof.pair_compose`'s job; until those figures are built that way
they stay here, and they are the only reason this module still runs.

Every colour convention below is imported from :mod:`woof.render`
rather than reinvented:

* ``_NWS_COLORS`` / ``_NWS_LEVELS`` -- the standard NWS 5 dBZ reflectivity
  ladder, with ``set_under("none")`` so sub-5 dBZ is transparent instead of
  a wash of blue over a clear domain;
* ``_PRECIP_LEVELS`` -- the NWS-style QPF ladder, on ``YlGnBu``;
* ``spacing_label`` -- the ``Δx 3 km`` subtitle token;
* recessive axes (``#444444`` labels, ``#999999`` spines), per-panel
  colorbars LABELLED WITH UNITS, and lon/lat pcolormesh on the file's own
  curvilinear coordinates so the map projection shapes the frame.

Two things this deliberately does NOT do.

It does not stretch a colour scale to the data.  Reflectivity is on the fixed
NWS ladder and precipitation on the fixed QPF ladder, so a weak field looks
weak.  The scales that ARE data-dependent (2 m temperature, 10 m wind, column
w) print their own limits in the colourbar label.

It does not hide a zero.  ``panel_or_note`` writes "field is uniformly X"
across a panel whose field has no variation, because a blank panel and a
panel of genuinely constant data look identical and only one of them is a
result.  At t+0 of this configuration that is the accurate state of every
surface diagnostic: Noah-MP and MYNN have not been called yet, so ``T2``,
``U10``, ``PBLH`` and the rest are still zero, and the reflectivity field is
uniformly the -35 dBZ floor because the initial state carries no condensate.

THE CROP
--------
``--crop`` cells are removed from every edge before plotting.  The domain is
PERIODIC on a REAL Lambert grid, so the wrap is a geographic discontinuity --
latitude, Coriolis and the solar zenith all jump across it -- and the rows
next to it are responding to an artefact.  The crop is stated in the figure
footer, not applied quietly.

    The seam figure asks the reader to look for a kink.  This asks the array.

    ``|F[j,i-1] - 2 F[j,i] + F[j,i+1]|`` -- a roughness that is large wherever
    the field is not smooth, which in a convecting domain is most places.

    The control is LOCAL, and that matters more than it sounds.  A domain has
    only ``n / tile - 1`` interior seams -- four per axis at 1440 with tile
    288 -- so comparing four columns against the domain mean measures where
    the storms happened to be, not the seams.  Each seam is therefore
    compared with the ``halfwidth`` columns on either side of it, which are
    in the same weather and differ only in that no tile boundary runs
    through them.

    The reported ratio is the mean over seams of ``roughness(seam) /
    roughness(its neighbours)``.  A halo that is too narrow, a tile that read
    a neighbour already advanced (the read-at-time-t rule in
    :mod:`tilestream.driver`), or a ring arena patching the wrong rectangle
    all put their error exactly on those columns, so any of them would push
    this well above 1.  Near 1 says the boundaries are not special -- which
    is the only thing it can accurately claim.  It does not prove the interior
    is right; the digest comparison does that.

    ``WMAX`` is the default rather than reflectivity because it is smooth
