"""Run the nest gate on a CONTENDED card without dying at someone else's peak.

Not part of the gate and not imported by it.  These boxes are shared by a
dozen agents; three runs of ``tilestream.test_nest`` were killed by
``OutOfMemoryError`` at allocations of 200 MB and 7 MB -- not because the
gate is large but because another process took the card between the gate's
first allocation and its tenth.  A measurement interrupted that way says
nothing about the code under test, so this wrapper does two things and
nothing else:

1. WAITS until the device has ``--reserve`` GiB free (polling
   ``cupy.cuda.runtime.memGetInfo``, never ``nvidia-smi``, whose used/free is
   unreliable under WSL2 and reports the whole host on a shared box);
2. RESERVES that memory into CuPy's own pool and keeps it there, by
   allocating it once and neutering ``free_all_blocks`` for the run.  The
   pool then hands the same physical bytes back to the gate instead of
   returning them to the driver for a neighbour to take.

Neither changes a computed value: ``free_all_blocks`` releases only UNUSED
cached blocks and allocator behaviour is not part of any comparator (the
same argument ``woof.core.model._trim_default_pool`` makes for calling it).
