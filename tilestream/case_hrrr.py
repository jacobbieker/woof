"""A real outbreak, initialised from a real HRRR analysis, run out of core.

Everything in ``tilestream/`` before this module ran on a seeded synthetic
draw or, on the ingest lane, on the frozen April-1974 ERA5 bundle.  This one
runs a CONVECTION-ALLOWING FORECAST of a real severe-weather outbreak from the
real HRRR analysis of that day, on a domain no card in the estate can hold
resident, and it is meant to be looked at by a forecaster rather than by a
digest comparison.

WHAT IS REAL HERE, STATED FIRST BECAUSE IT IS THE POINT
-------------------------------------------------------
* the initial condition is the operational HRRR **analysis** (f00) of the
  case cycle, decoded by the packaged ``hrrr_grib2_bridge`` from the archived
  NOAA GRIB2 on ``noaa-hrrr-bdp-pds``, interpolated to the target Lambert grid
  by ``woof.ingest.hrrr.interpolate_hrrr_to_lambert`` and turned into a model
  state by ``woof.ingest.real.initialize_real`` -- the production ingest,
  called, not reimplemented;
* the terrain, land use, soil category, greenness, albedo and deep soil
  temperature are the real WPS_GEOG geogrid statics for the target grid,
  built by ``woof.static.build.build_static``;
* the lateral boundaries are the SAME HRRR cycle's later forecast hours, each
  one decoded and initialised the same way, applied on the real hourly cadence
  and linearly interpolated between them -- never synthesised from the model's
  own state;
* the physics is the streaming gate's own ``full+MYNN+Noah-MP`` rung.

THE LATERAL BOUNDARY, AND WHY IT IS NOT WRF's
---------------------------------------------
This is the first real lateral boundary condition through the tiled path and
it needed a design decision, so the decision is written down rather than
buried.

WRF's specified boundary is a 1-cell ``spec_zone`` overwrite plus a 4-cell
Davies relaxation applied INSIDE the RK stages, on the DOMAIN's perimeter
(``woof.ingest.lateral_bc.apply_state_lateral_boundaries``).  A tile is
stepped as a small domain of its own, so switching ``cfg.specified`` on for a
tile would apply that treatment to the TILE's four edges -- three of which are
usually interior seams of the real domain, where a boundary condition is
simply wrong.  The kernel walks a perimeter frame
(``woof/core/kernels/lbc_state.cu``'s ``frame_point``) and has no per-side
switch, so "specified on the sides that are really the domain's, free on the
others" is not expressible today.  **That is the gap, and it is real: the
streaming path cannot run WRF's own specified/relaxation boundary unmodified.**

What it CAN run, exactly and with no dycore change, is a wide Davies frame
applied at the sweep seam:

    every tile is stepped exactly as the bit-exact gate steps it -- periodic
    in its own array, no boundary treatment at all -- and after every sweep
    the outer ``hard + taper`` cells of the DOMAIN are replaced by the
    time-interpolated analysis, hard inside ``hard`` and cosine-blended
    across ``taper``.

The correctness argument is the halo argument, run once more:

* a tile's own array edges wrap, so the outermost ``halo_radius(cfg)`` cells
  of a tile's array are contaminated by that wrap after one step.  For an
  INTERIOR tile those cells are the halo and are discarded, which is the
  whole reason the halo exists.  For an EDGE tile, whose window is clamped to
  the domain (``spec.plan_tiles(..., periodic=False)``), they are domain cells
  ``0 .. halo-1``;
* so as long as the hard zone is at least ``halo_radius(cfg) + 1`` cells deep,
  every contaminated cell is inside it and is overwritten before it can be
  read again.  A cell at depth ``hard`` reads a halo reaching to depth
  ``hard - halo >= 1``, i.e. only into cells the previous sweep prescribed
  correctly.  :data:`HARD_MARGIN` is the margin over that bound.

It is a real lateral boundary condition -- a wide-frame Davies scheme, the
family AROME/HIRLAM use -- driven by real analysis data on its real cadence.
It is NOT WRF's, it is not bit-comparable with a monolithic WRF-style run, and
a figure produced through it must not be described as one.  The outer
``hard + taper`` cells are boundary-zone artefact by construction and nothing
inside them is a forecast.

WHAT ELSE THE FRAME HOLDS STILL
-------------------------------
Only the analysis' own prognostic fields can be prescribed from an analysis.
Every OTHER streamed carrier in the hard zone -- the held tendencies, the
acoustic perturbations, ``h_diabatic``, the whole surface/soil/snow bundle --
is restored to its time-zero value there instead, because those cells are
being driven by wrapped garbage every step and are one long integration away
from a NaN that would then be prescribed into the domain.  They are column
local (see ``harness.halo_radius``), so freezing them inside the frame cannot
reach the interior.
