"""Timing for the tiled streaming pipeline, with correctness attached.

Everything in here exists because a streaming bug that skips work looks
EXACTLY like a speedup.  So:

* every timed configuration also produces a SHA-256 over the persisted set
  (:func:`tilestream.harness.hash_state`), and the runner refuses to report a
  number it could have checked but did not;
* :class:`TiledRunner` -- the object that is actually timed -- is checked
  against :func:`tilestream.driver.run_tiled`, the loop the bit-exact gate
  validated, by :func:`selftest_runner_matches_driver`.  A faster loop that
  computes something else is not a result.

Why a separate runner at all
----------------------------
``run_tiled`` builds its plan, its tile ``DomainState`` s, its streams and its
shadow store on every call.  That is right for a correctness gate and wrong
for a measurement: at a 544-cell tile the setup is milliseconds against a
sweep of hundreds, but at a 1056-cell tile it is not, and the setup cost would
silently masquerade as tiling overhead.  :class:`TiledRunner` hoists all of it
into ``__init__`` and exposes :meth:`TiledRunner.sweep`, which is one full
domain step and nothing else.  The semantics -- shadow buffers, the swap, the
pre-loop ``deviceSynchronize`` that a non-blocking stream needs -- are
reproduced exactly; ``selftest_runner_matches_driver`` is what makes that
claim checkable rather than asserted.

Timing method
-------------
Wall time is ``perf_counter`` around a region bracketed by full
``deviceSynchronize`` calls, because the pipeline spans several streams and a
single stream's events cannot see the whole thing.  The per-phase split
(:meth:`TiledRunner.sweep` with ``events=True``) uses CUDA events recorded on
each tile's own stream, which measures how long each phase OCCUPIED that
stream -- including any stall waiting for a shared engine.  That is the number
that answers "is the copy actually hidden?", and it is why the sum of the
parts exceeding the wall clock is the signal of successful overlap rather
than an inconsistency.

Seeding a domain too big to build
---------------------------------
:func:`seed_host_store` fills a pinned host store directly, without ever
constructing a full-domain ``DomainState`` -- necessary once the domain
exceeds VRAM, since ``harness.make_state`` is a device object.  It reproduces
``harness.make_state``'s amplitudes on top of the at-rest profile, which is
horizontally uniform under milestone-one settings (``terrain_opt=0``,
``map_proj=0``) and so can be read off a tiny probe state and broadcast.
``p``/``al``/``alt`` are left at their at-rest values rather than being made
consistent with the seeded ``thp``/``php``/``mup``: ``dycore.step`` recomputes
all three from the prognostic set through ``calc_p_alpha`` four times per
step, so the inconsistency does not survive the first step and never leaves
the O(1) perturbation range.  It is NOT the same state
``harness.make_state`` builds and must not be compared against one -- both
sides of any comparison here are filled from the same store.

    # full.  Measured at 1950^2, tile 512, host store: sum(parts)/wall = 0.909

    # ``nbuffers - 1``: a tile can only be prefetched into a buffer whose
    # previous occupant has already been scattered, and stream ordering on
    # that buffer's stream enforces exactly that with no extra events.
