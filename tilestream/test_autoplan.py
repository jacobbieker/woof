"""Tests for :mod:`tilestream.autoplan`, negative controls included.

A planner is an unusually easy thing to write a vacuous test for.  "It
returned a plan" proves nothing; "it refused" proves nothing either, because
a planner that refuses everything passes every refusal test ever written.  So
every capability here is checked twice -- once for the answer, and once for a
CONTROL that fails if the feature is switched off or quietly broken:

===========================  ===============================================
capability                   the control that would catch it being fake
===========================  ===============================================
fits resident                a domain one notch larger must NOT fit resident
needs tiling                 the tile must shrink when the card does
needs host RAM               the store must exceed VRAM, and be pinnable
cannot run                   a domain one notch SMALLER must plan fine
halo from ``halo_radius``    it must change with ``time_step_sound``
tile divides the domain      a prime extent must be reported as ragged
the VRAM model itself        allocate the plan and compare (GPU only)
===========================  ===============================================

The last row is the one that matters most.  Everything above it tests that
the planner is self-consistent; only that one tests that the planner is
RIGHT, and it is the only test here that touches a GPU.  Run it with::

    python -m tilestream.test_autoplan            # arithmetic only
    python -m tilestream.test_autoplan --gpu      # plus the allocation check

    against what the model predicted.  It must be an UPPER bound (a planner
    that under-predicts hands out a tile that OOMs) and it must not be a
    vacuous one -- a model that returned the whole card would pass an
    upper-bound test and is useless, so the prediction is also required to be
    within 35% of the truth.

    THE INSTRUMENT IS VALIDATED BEFORE THE MODEL IS.  ``memGetInfo`` reports
    the whole device, not this process, and differencing it only measures our
    allocation while nobody else's residency moves -- which on a Windows
    desktop is false.  MEASURED on the local RTX 3080 with the desktop in
    use: one run read a NEGATIVE 2.206 GiB allocation (the driver evicted
    ~2.6 GiB of background applications to make room for us), and another,
    minutes later, read 2.02 GiB MORE than we allocated and failed at
    ``0.838x`` as "the model UNDER-predicted".  Neither number is a fact
    about the model.  So each reading is checked against cupy's own pool --
    which counts this process only -- over the same window, and a reading
    that the pool does not account for is refused BY NAME instead of being
    charged to the planner.  The check needs an idle or headless card; that
    is a property of the instrument, not a tolerance to widen.
