"""Cut a smaller wrfout out of a big one, so the renderer can zoom.

``woof render --engine rust`` draws a whole file; it has no crop switch, and
a 1200x900 sheet at 3 km shows a supercell as four pixels.  The accurate way to
zoom is therefore not to resample the picture but to write a SMALLER FILE that
covers the sub-rectangle -- same forecast, same valid time, same 3 km cells,
fewer of them -- and render that.  Nothing is interpolated and nothing is
re-derived: every value in the crop is the identical float32 the full frame
carried.

WHAT IS ADJUSTED, AND WHY EACH ONE
----------------------------------
* Every field is sliced on its own stagger.  A mass field keeps
  ``[j0:j1, i0:i1]``; a ``west_east_stag`` field keeps ``[j0:j1, i0:i1+1]``
  because its closing face belongs to the last mass cell; likewise
  ``south_north_stag`` in y.  Slicing all of them as mass would drop the
  closing face and give the writer a shape its dimension table refuses --
  which is the good outcome; the bad one is a file that opens and is one
  column short.
* ``CEN_LAT``/``CEN_LON`` are moved to the crop's own centre and ``GRID_ID``
  becomes 2.  Both are read by the renderer -- the first for the map, the
  second for the ``d0N-3km`` filename token that keeps two renders of one run
  from overwriting each other.  ``MOAD_CEN_LAT``, ``TRUELAT*`` and
  ``STAND_LON`` are NOT touched: the projection is unchanged, only the window
  onto it.
* ``XLAT``/``XLONG`` come along as data, so the crop needs no reprojection at
  all and cannot disagree with the parent about where a cell is.

THIS IS A CROP, NOT A NEST.  ``GRID_ID = 2`` names a second grid because the
extents really are different, but there is no second integration behind it:
the cells are d01's own, at d01's 3 km spacing, and any figure made from one
must say "crop" rather than imply a nested downscale.
