"""Tighten the RRTMGP workspace: the RTE phases carry cubes they never read.

WHAT THE ATTRIBUTION POINTS AT
------------------------------
``SharedRRTMGPChunkWorkspace`` allocates the MAXIMUM over its four solver
phases, and at ``nz = 49, p_top = 10 kPa, chunk = 3125`` that maximum is
``lw_rte`` at 978.2 MiB against ``lw_optics`` 569.0, ``sw_optics`` 738.5 and
``sw_rte`` 712.9.  One phase sets the whole allocation, so one phase is where
a reclamation has to land.

``lw_rte``'s declared live set is 978.2 MiB because it keeps every
``lw_optics`` slot at its original offset and then APPENDS its own outputs
after them.  But three of those carried slots are not read by anything in the
RTE phase:

  ==============  ========  =====================================
  carried slot       MiB     last reader
  ==============  ========  =====================================
  ``gas_tau``       225.8    ``_finalize_cloud_optics`` (optics)
  ``cld_tau``        14.1    ``_finalize_cloud_optics`` (optics)
  ``cld_ssa``        14.1    ``_finalize_cloud_optics`` (optics)
  ``cld_asy``        14.1    ``_finalize_cloud_optics`` (optics)
  ``col_dry``         0.9    ``_gas_optics`` / Planck takes ``vmr``
  ==============  ========  =====================================

``_lw_rte`` is handed ``optics_lw.tau``, the Planck sources and the
emissivity; ``_planck_sources`` is handed ``play/plev/tlay/tlev/tsfc`` and
``vmr``.  Neither ever sees ``gas_tau`` or the band cloud optics.  The
shipped layout is not wrong -- it is a covering superset, and a superset is
the safe direction -- but it holds a quarter of the workspace for slots that
are dead.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES, AND WHY REORDERING IS THE WHOLE TRICK
------------------------------------------------------------
``phase()`` assigns offsets by walking its layout in order, so a carried slot
moves the instant anything before it changes size.  That is why the shipped
layout cannot simply drop the dead slots: ``optics_tau`` has to stay at the
byte offset ``lw_optics`` wrote it to.

Dropping them in place and padding the holes recovers only 180.3 MiB,
because ``lev_source`` (228.9 MiB) does not fit the hole ``gas_tau``
(225.8 MiB) leaves -- three megabytes short -- and the padding then wastes
most of what the other holes freed.  So this module first REORDERS each
optics phase to put the carried slots at the FRONT.  Reordering inside a
phase is free (every slot of an optics phase is written before it is read in
that same phase, so where it sits is invisible), and it turns the scattered
holes into one contiguous tail.  A tail needs no padding at all: the RTE
phase lays its outputs over it and simply stops earlier.

That is the difference between 180.3 MiB and 239.7 MiB, and it is why there
is not a single ``_pad`` entry in the result.

WHAT IT IS WORTH -- IT DEPENDS ON THE MODEL TOP, SO BOTH ARE STATED
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The LW column is ``nz`` plus a synthetic above-model cap whose depth is a
function of ``p_top``, and the saving lives in the LW phases:

  ==================================  ==========  =========  =========
  configuration                        shipped      tight      saved
  ==================================  ==========  =========  =========
  p_top 10 kPa (real74, LW 74 layers)  978.2 MiB  738.5 MiB  239.7 MiB
  p_top 5.7 kPa (WK82 20 km, LW 63)    834.6 MiB  738.5 MiB   96.1 MiB
  ==================================  ==========  =========  =========

Both land on 738.5 MiB because after the tightening the binding phase is no
longer ``lw_rte`` but ``sw_optics``, whose five g-point cubes really are
simultaneously live inside ``_finalize_cloud_optics``.  738.5 MiB at chunk
3125 is therefore the floor for this reclamation; going below it means
changing what the solver holds, not where it holds it.

WHY THE POISON CONTROL IS THE POINT
-----------------------------------
"Nothing reads gas_tau during lw_rte" is a lifetime claim, and this project
has produced seven false results from claims that looked at least this
obvious.  So the claim is not argued, it is EXECUTED: :func:`build` with
``poison="dead"`` NaN-fills the entire region this module calls dead, at the
exact instant the RTE phase begins, and the gate requires the answer to stay
bit-exact.  If any of it is really read, NaN propagates into the fluxes and
the digest moves by a mile.

And the control has its own control: ``poison="live"`` fills the carried
prefix instead, which the RTE phase demonstrably does read.  That one must
NOT survive -- and it does not: it dies in
``PhysicsDriver._run_radiation``'s finite check with "radiation rthratenlw
contains a non-finite value".  A poison that cannot break the run proves
nothing by failing to break it.
