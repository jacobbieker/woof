"""The restart gate: stream N, checkpoint, reload, continue, same digest.

Nothing in this project had ever written a restart from a streamed run.  This
is the proof that one can be written and read back, and it is built the way
every other proof here is built -- against a monolithic reference, with the
controls that make the comparison capable of failing.

THE SHAPE OF THE PROOF
----------------------
For one configuration (a real Lambert projection, real terrain, the
229-carrier ``full+MYNN+Noah-MP`` rung and the fast-cadence rung that is the
only one calling radiation during the compared steps)::

    A   monolithic 2N steps                        -> reference digests
    B   streamed 2N steps, uninterrupted           -> must equal A
    C   streamed N, WRITE restart, fresh store,
        fresh tile buffers, READ restart,
        streamed N more                            -> must equal A and B

C is the claim.  A is what keeps B and C accurate: a restart round trip that
reproduced a streamed run which was itself wrong would still pass B == C.

WHAT "FRESH" MEANS, AND WHY IT IS THE WHOLE POINT
-------------------------------------------------
The second half of C never touches the first half's memory.  Its store is a
NEW pinned allocation, its geography store is a NEW pinned allocation, and its
tile buffers are built from scratch by ``run_tiled``.  The only thing that
crosses is the file.  ``preset`` decides what the new store holds BEFORE the
restart is read:

``"start"`` (default)
    the preparation state, i.e. exactly what a real resumed run has after it
    rebuilds its initial condition and before it restores.  A carrier the
    restart fails to deliver silently reverts to t=0 -- plausible values, no
    NaN, no warning.  This is the failure mode the three-inventory mismatch
    produces and it is what the drop control exercises.

``"poison"``
    NaN everywhere.  Bit-exact anyway, which is the statement that nothing in
    the answer came from what the store held before the restore.

THE CONTROLS
------------
``drop=("fields/ust",)  allow_missing=True``   MUST differ.  One carrier left
    out of the file and the reader told not to mind.  ``ust`` is the friction
    velocity: carried by the surface layer, read by the PBL, and in the
    ``fields/*`` half of the manifest that ``STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS`` cannot
    see -- so it is exactly the kind of state a contract-only restart drops.

``drop=("fields/ust",)  allow_missing=False``  MUST REFUSE.  The same file
    read normally.  Without this row the first control proves only that a
    broken file breaks; with it, the breakage is unshippable.

``store built from STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS``    MUST REFUSE at WRITE.  25
    members offered where the manifest has 229.

``a restart from the wrong setup``             MUST REFUSE at READ.  Same
    config, same carriers, geography rebuilt per tile instead of the
    domain's: the setup fingerprint moves and the file is rejected rather
    than resumed onto a different projection.
