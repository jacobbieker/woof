"""Two independent VRAM models, priced side by side, at four domain sizes.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
WOOF answers the question "does this domain fit on this card?" TWICE, with
two models that were built by different people for different gates and never
compared:

* :func:`woof.core.preflight.estimate_experiment` -- an ITEMIZED estimate.
  It enumerates every persistent device array from the shape formulas in
  ``state.py`` / ``physics.py`` / the scratch registry, adds the step
  transients and a 15% allocator headroom, and is the number ``woof go``'s
  memory gate refuses on and ``woof check --alloc`` enforces.
* :func:`tilestream.autoplan.plan` -- a FITTED model.  Four measured rungs,
  each a ``(process fixed, per-buffer fixed, bytes per cell)`` triple fitted
  by non-negative least squares over 29 measured allocations on two cards,
  inflated 6% past its worst under-prediction.  It is the number
  ``[tiles] mode = "auto"`` decides on.

``mode = "auto"`` therefore asks autoplan whether a domain fits while the
route that will run it asks preflight.  If the two disagree, ``auto`` streams
a domain preflight thinks is resident, or runs resident a domain autoplan
thinks needs streaming -- and in the second case the run dies at exactly the
allocation the mode existed to avoid.

WHAT IS COMPARED, AND WHY IT IS NOT ONE NUMBER
----------------------------------------------
The two models do not price the same thing, so three numbers are printed:

``alloc_estimate``      preflight's ENFORCED pool number: headroom x (resident
                        + shared workspace + step transients).  It is a POOL
                        number -- it does not include the CUDA context or the
                        kernels' local-memory backing store.
``peak_envelope``       preflight's DEVICE number: the alloc estimate plus the
                        non-pool intercept (context + local memory) plus an
                        unmodelled term.  This is what ``go``'s gate refuses
                        on, so it is the one a user actually meets.
``autoplan_resident``   autoplan's ``Footprint.resident_bytes``: CUDA context
                        + process fixed + one buffer of the whole domain,
                        x 1.06.  A DEVICE number by construction.

``peak_envelope`` and ``autoplan_resident`` are the comparable pair; the
alloc estimate is printed because it is the one the drift guard and the N0
gate are written against.
