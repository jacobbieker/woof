"""What a full-physics domain ACTUALLY costs, against both models that price it.

THE QUESTION THIS SETTLES
-------------------------
:mod:`tilestream.ledger_ladder` shows that WOOF's two VRAM models disagree by
a factor that grows with the domain: preflight prices the full(real74) rung at
~887 B/cell of pool estimate (771 B/cell before its 15% allocator headroom)
and adds a 2.9 GiB non-pool intercept on top; autoplan prices the same rung at
541 B/cell plus a 3.6 GiB fixed term, inflated 6%.  Between those two numbers
there is a band of domain sizes on every card where autoplan says "resident is
fine" -- so ``[tiles] mode = "auto"`` does not stream -- and preflight then
refuses the run outright.

Arithmetic cannot say which of them is right.  A card can.  This probe builds
ONE resident domain at each requested size, steps it until radiation and
cumulus have both fired several times, and reads the pool and the device
against both predictions.  A size inside the disagreement band is the whole
point: if the domain allocates and steps, preflight is refusing a run that
works; if it OOMs, autoplan is planning a run that cannot.

WHY IT STEPS RATHER THAN ALLOCATING
-----------------------------------
"It allocated" is not "it runs": on these boxes the state allocates and the
FIRST step then OOMs on per-step scratch, and Kain-Fritsch's ``cumulus/w0avg``
and the radiation column packer are allocated LAZILY on first use.  A
zero-step allocation probe -- which is exactly what ``woof check --alloc``
is -- therefore measures a footprint no running forecast ever has.  So this
one steps, and prints the physics driver's own call counts so a reader can
see that radiation and cumulus fired inside the measured window rather than
taking it on trust.

The cadence is set to the STEP cadence of ``configs/real74_d01.toml``
(radt 12 min / cudt 5 min at dt = 60 s -> every 12 and every 5 steps), not to
its wall-clock cadence, because this harness's dx = 500 m needs dt = 3 s and
the wall-clock cadence would then fire radiation once every 240 steps.

NO TIMINGS ARE QUOTED FROM THIS FILE.  It measures bytes.  Several of the
window sizes here are below the ~500-cell floor under which a timing measures
an idle GPU rather than the code.

WHAT IT MEASURED
----------------
RTX 5090 (shared with three other lanes, which is why the numbers below are
POOL numbers -- see :func:`resident`), harness ``full`` rung, nz = 49, 30
steps, radiation firing 3 times and cumulus 7 times inside every window, and
a state digest recorded per rung so a run that skipped work would show::

  n     pf alloc  pf held  ap device | pool used pk  pool held pk | u/alloc  h/held  h/ap
  256^2    3.343    3.343    5.491   |    1.603         3.117     |  0.479   0.932  0.568
  352^2    5.571    5.571    7.019   |    4.589         6.656     |  0.824   1.195  0.948

Three things fall out, and the third is the one that matters.

1.  Preflight's ``alloc_estimate`` holds as an upper bound on pool USED at
    both rungs, and tightens with size (0.479 -> 0.824).  That is the N0
    gate's ``alloc_measured_le_estimate`` leg, and it passes.
2.  Preflight's HELD projection does not.  On Linux the tier-2 retention term
    is zero, so ``held_projection == alloc_estimate``, and the measured pool
    held peak is already 1.195x it at 352^2.  Pool-held is device memory the
    process is holding, so this is a real over-run of a published projection,
    not a bookkeeping distinction.
3.  Autoplan is the OPTIMISTIC model, not preflight.  At 352^2 the CuPy pool
    alone holds 6.656 GiB against autoplan's 7.019 GiB prediction for the
    WHOLE DEVICE -- 0.948 of it -- leaving 0.36 GiB for a CUDA context that
    autoplan's own constant puts at 0.39 GiB, before the local-memory backing
    store is counted at all.  So in the band where the two models disagree
    (:mod:`tilestream.ledger_ladder`), it is ``auto``'s "resident is fine"
    that is wrong and preflight's refusal that is defensible.  Two rungs on
    one card is a direction, not a re-fit; the fix belongs on autoplan's side
    and wants the 29-point measurement redone before anything is changed.
