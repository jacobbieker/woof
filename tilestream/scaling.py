"""Scaling measurement for the WOOF two-GPU decomposition.

Every timed configuration also produces a SHA-256 over the assembled domain,
because a decomposition bug that skips work looks exactly like a speedup.
Where a monolithic reference exists (the domain fits one card) the digest is
compared against it; where it does not (the whole point of the weak-scaling
row) the digest is cross-checked between pipelines and a no-exchange control
must differ.

One process per configuration.  CuPy's pool does not hand memory back cleanly
between a 22 GiB monolithic run and a 22 GiB sub-domain in the same process,
and a ceiling measured after a failed allocation measures the allocator.  Each
``cmd`` below is therefore one invocation and one process; a driver script
loops over configurations by loop over ``python -m tilestream.scaling ...``,
never by calling ``main`` twice.

WHY THE INITIAL STATE IS CACHED ON DISK, when run_bench reseeds
---------------------------------------------------------------
:mod:`tilestream.run_bench` runs its stages in separate processes for the same
allocator reason, and gets an identical starting state in each of them by
DETERMINISTIC RESEED -- ``bench.seed_host_store`` reconstructs the same bytes
from ``--n``/``--seed``, so nothing has to be written down.  That is the better
mechanism where it applies and it does not apply here, twice over:

* the sizes this module exists to measure are ones ``harness.make_state``
  cannot build.  It draws every perturbation on the host and uploads it, which
  overshoots the pool by ~30% and OOMs on a domain the card can perfectly well
  STEP.  :func:`frugal_state` draws on the device instead and is used for the
  timing-only rows -- but a frugal state is not a reseedable reference, so the
  only way the 1-GPU and 2-GPU runs at that size can be shown to have started
  from the same state is that they loaded the same file;
* :func:`build_init_x2` builds a ``2nx``-wide domain by concatenating two
  independently-seeded halves.  There is no seed that produces it.

So the discipline here is: build the initial condition ONCE, persist it, and
have every configuration load THAT.  Nothing times the build.

This module is the multi-GPU sibling of :mod:`tilestream.run_bench`, and is
kept separate from it for the same reason :mod:`tilestream.multigpu` is kept
separate from :mod:`tilestream.driver`: the single-GPU out-of-core lane must
not acquire an import of the multi-GPU one.
