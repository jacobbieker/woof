"""Fresh-node acceptance smoke: full physics, streaming, multi-GPU.

Six stages, each of which fails a DIFFERENT real bring-up failure that
has actually happened on a rented box.  Run it as the last step of the
bootstrap; a node that passes all six can be given work.

  1  cuBLAS load        the wrong CuPy wheel imports cleanly, compiles
                        kernels, and dies at the first cuBLAS load.  An
                        import probe cannot see it; a matmul can.
  2  Thompson tables    freezeH2O.dat is not in the wheel and not in the
                        repo.  Missing, it blocks mp28, therefore every
                        moist rung, therefore cumulus -- and it surfaces
                        as "cumulus physics requires a moist DomainState",
                        which reads like a config mistake and is not one.
  3  full physics fires builds the real rung (full+MYNN+Noah-MP, nz=49,
                        ztop=20000) and steps from clock 0 so radiation
                        AND cumulus are DUE inside the window.  Asserts
                        the fire counts are non-zero by wrapping the
                        driver's own due-predicates -- a rung that
                        silently fell back to dry passes every other
                        check and every number taken on it is wrong.
                        Also records peak-on-fire VRAM, which is what a
                        sizing formula must be built from: RRTMGP and KF
                        allocate scratch only on the steps they fire, so
                        a ceiling that never crossed a radiation boundary
                        is not a ceiling.
  4  streaming exact    tiled == monolithic, carrier by carrier, at the
                        same rung.  Streaming buys CAPACITY, never speed.
  5  multi-GPU exact    P=2 halo exchange bit-exact against the 1-GPU
                        monolithic reference, with rad/cu fired on both
                        sides.  Skipped with a stated reason on 1 card.
  6  sweep returns      runs several DIFFERENT configurations back to
                        back in one process and checks device occupancy
                        returns to baseline each time.  Decides whether
                        this node may be driven by a sweep at all.

Every stage prints what it proved, not that it passed.  Exit status is
the number of failed stages.

#: Each CUDA library is loaded SEPARATELY, because "cuBLAS failed" has two
#: completely different causes with two different fixes and the existing
#: tooling conflates them:
#:
#:   wrong wheel      cupy-cuda12x on a CUDA-13-only box.  Imports cleanly,
#:                    compiles kernels, dies at the first cuBLAS load.
#:                    Fix: install the wheel matching the DRIVER major.
#:   missing libs     the RIGHT wheel, but no CUDA math libraries on the
#:                    box at all.  `pip install cupy-cuda13x` pulls ONLY
#:                    numpy + cuda-pathfinder -- it does NOT pull cuBLAS,
#:                    cuFFT or cuSOLVER.  The 8x4090 box got them from its
#:                    image's system toolkit (nvcc 13.0.88), which a bare
#:                    node does not have.  MEASURED on this dev box: NVRTC
#:                    and cuRAND load, cuBLAS and cuFFT do not.
#:                    Fix: pip install 'cupy-cuda13x[ctk]'.
#:
#: NVRTC is separated out because it is the one that is actually fatal to
#: a forecast: every woof kernel is JIT-compiled.  Full physics runs with
#: cuBLAS absent (measured); the DA eigensolver and `woof doctor`'s own
#: pairing probe do not.
