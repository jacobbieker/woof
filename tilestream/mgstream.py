"""N GPUs streaming tiles out of ONE pinned host domain.

:mod:`tilestream.driver` streams every tile of a host-resident domain through
ONE GPU.  ``multigpu`` gives each GPU a sub-domain that lives PERMANENTLY in
its VRAM and exchanges halos over the peer link.  This module is the case
nobody had run: the domain stays in pinned host RAM, and *G* GPUs each pull
their own share of the tiles out of that one store.


THE HALO EXCHANGE DISAPPEARS, AND THAT IS THE POINT
---------------------------------------------------
The brief for this lane warned that "a sub-domain's halo exchange and its tile
gathers are two different things touching the same edges".  On a host-resident
domain they are not two things.  They are one.

With sub-domains resident in VRAM, GPU 0 cannot see GPU 1's cells at all, so
the seam needs an explicit transport: pack the band, ``cudaMemcpyPeerAsync``,
unpack.  With the domain in host RAM every GPU can already address every cell.
A tile whose window crosses the boundary between GPU 0's slab and GPU 1's slab
gathers the neighbouring cells the same way it gathers its own -- one
``cudaMemcpy3DAsync`` out of the shared store, halo and interior together, with
no idea that a boundary was crossed.  There is no pack, no peer copy, no
unpack, and no seam code to get wrong.

What survives is the ORDERING obligation, which was never really about
transport: every tile must read its neighbours as they were at the start of
the sweep (:mod:`tilestream.driver`'s read-at-time-t rule).  Across GPUs that
obligation is identical to the single-GPU one, because it is a property of the
STORE, not of who is reading it.  So the entire multi-GPU correctness question
reduces to: is the time-t invariant still enforced when the readers are on
different devices?  That is what ``write_mode`` decides, and the two answers
behave very differently.


``write_mode="shadow"`` -- PARALLEL
-----------------------------------
Two stores.  Every tile reads ``src`` and writes ``dst``; nothing a tile writes
is ever read in the same sweep.  There are therefore NO cross-tile hazards at
all, on one GPU or on eight, and the workers need exactly one barrier per
sweep.  This is the design that parallelises, and it is what the scaling
numbers in this module were taken with.  It costs a second host store.

``write_mode="ring"`` -- SEQUENTIAL, and this is a real limitation
------------------------------------------------------------------
:mod:`tilestream.rings` removes the second store by keeping ONE store and
saving each tile's outer band before it is overwritten, so a later tile can be
patched back to time-t values.  "Later" is the essential word: the scheme
is defined over a TOTAL ORDER on tiles, and tile *k* patches from the saved
rings of its neighbours that come before it.  Those dependencies are real
device-side dependencies, and they do not care that two tiles are on different
GPUs.

With a block partition (GPU 0 takes tiles ``0..m-1``, GPU 1 takes ``m..``),
GPU 1's FIRST tile has tile ``m-1`` -- GPU 0's LAST tile -- among its patch
dependencies.  So GPU 1 cannot start until GPU 0 has essentially finished, and
two GPUs take as long as one.  Striping (``partition="stripe"``) turns the
whole-slab stall into a per-tile one, which pipelines a little and still does
not scale.  This is not a bug in this module and no scheduling fixes it: the
ring is a Gauss-Seidel sweep and a Gauss-Seidel sweep is sequential.

The accurate cure for a memory-constrained multi-GPU box is not to parallelise
the ring but to give each GPU its OWN sub-domain store with its own halo band
and its own private ring, and to refresh those bands between steps -- i.e. to
put :mod:`tilestream.multigpu`'s decomposition in host RAM instead of VRAM.
Then every ring dependency is local to one GPU.  That design is sketched in
``subdomain_plan`` and is NOT implemented here; what is implemented is the
shared-store case, because that is the one that answers the bandwidth
question, and the bandwidth question is what decides whether any of this is
worth doing.


ORDERING ACROSS DEVICES, when the ring is used anyway
-----------------------------------------------------
Two things have to be true and only one of them is CUDA's problem.

*Device side.*  ``cudaStreamWaitEvent`` accepts an event recorded on another
device, so the dependency itself crosses GPUs with no special handling.

*Host side.*  It does NOT accept an event that has not been recorded yet: a
wait on an unrecorded event is a no-op, silently.  In the single-GPU driver
that can never happen, because one thread submits tiles in order and the
dependency always names an earlier tile.  With one thread per GPU that
guarantee is gone -- GPU 1's thread can reach its wait before GPU 0's thread
has recorded anything -- and the failure is invisible: the run completes, the
fields look like weather, and the digest is wrong only sometimes.  So each
tile also carries a plain ``threading.Event`` that is set at SUBMISSION time,
and a worker blocks on that before issuing the CUDA wait.  It cannot deadlock
because every dependency names a lower-numbered tile and every worker walks
its own tiles in increasing order.

``cross_worker_sync="none"`` drops exactly that host-side handshake and keeps
everything else.  It is the negative control for the ring path: with it the
two-GPU digest must DIFFER from the monolithic one, and if it does not, the
ordering being tested was never essential and a "bit-exact" result proves
nothing.

The shadow path has exactly one ordering obligation -- the per-sweep barrier,
without which a fast worker starts reading the next sweep's ``src`` while a
slow one is still writing it -- and ``sweep_barrier=False`` is its negative
control.  Both live in :func:`tilestream.test_mgstream.negative_controls`.
A negative control that does not fire is reported as a failure of the control,
not as a pass: this project has been fooled before by an ordering that looked
enforced and was not.


PHYSICS ON, AND WHERE TWO CARDS ACTUALLY BROKE
----------------------------------------------
Everything above was measured DRY -- nine arrays, no ``PhysicsDriver``, no
scalar clock.  ``tile_state_factory=`` is the seam that lets a buffer carry
physics (it was hard-wired to ``driver.make_tile_state``, which attaches no
driver, so ``dycore.step`` raised at every rung above dry).  With it,
:mod:`tilestream.test_mgphys` streams the whole ``full fast cadence`` carrier
set -- radiation firing every step, cumulus every other -- and the TRANSPORT
is unchanged by physics: one worker, and two workers on ONE card, reproduce a
resident run bit for bit in ring and shadow, block and stripe.

What broke was not here.  Four physics schemes memoize DEVICE arrays (or
device-bound kernel handles) in caches keyed on everything except the device,
so the second card in a process dereferences the first card's pointers:
``rrtmgp.GasTables/CloudTables.to_device``, ``kf._device_table``,
``mynn_pbl_runtime._VALIDITY_FLAGS``, ``noahmp_vegeflux_gpu._module`` and
``noahmp_slab_libm._KERNEL_CACHE``.  Diagnosed with an order control -- touch
device 0 first and device 1 dies, touch device 1 first and device 0 dies --
and fixed by keying each on the current device.  Two consequences worth
carrying:

* an illegal address destroys the CUDA context for the whole PROCESS, so ONE
  such step makes every later run in that process fail at some unrelated
  allocation.  A multi-GPU worker that fails must therefore DRAIN before it
  aborts its barriers, or its in-flight DMA lands on the pinned store the
  caller is about to free -- which is how the first symptom was produced.
* the per-process lookup tables are now per CARD.  ``preflight
  .k_distribution_bytes`` counts them once per process and is, from here on,
  a PER-DEVICE figure.
