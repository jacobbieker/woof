"""The FULL cross-step carrier set, for streaming a physics-on domain.

Milestone one streamed :data:`woof.state_serialization_contract.
STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS` -- 9 arrays dry, 32.3 B/cell -- and
:func:`tilestream.driver.assert_streaming_inventory_complete` proved that set
was the whole cross-step state.  With physics on it is not, and the proof
does not notice, for a structural reason worth stating plainly:

    that check refills the streamed fields and then compares
    ``harness.hash_field_map``, which walks STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS.  Anything
    carried in ``state._scratch`` or on ``state.physics`` is invisible to
    BOTH halves -- never refilled, so it stays dirty; never compared, so the
    dirt never shows.  At ``moist=True, mp_physics=10`` it returns PASS while
    ``scratch/mp_rainnc`` and ``driver/pending_rainbl`` are demonstrably
    carried and not streamed.  At any rung with ``physics_enabled(cfg)`` it
    does not run at all: it builds its probe states with
    ``harness.make_state``, which attaches no ``PhysicsDriver``, so
    ``dycore.step`` raises before the comparison.

WHERE THE CARRIED STATE ACTUALLY LIVES
--------------------------------------
``woof/core/model.py:838`` calls ``step(node.state, node.cfg.run, ...)`` and
nothing else, so physics is a config change -- but the state physics carries
is NOT all on the ``DomainState``.  Four places hold it:

===========================  ==========================================
``state.<attr>``             STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS (prognostics, moist
                             species, h_diabatic, tke, effective radii)
``state._scratch[slot]``     restart.SERIALIZED_SCRATCH_SLOTS -- the
                             ``mp_*`` precipitation accumulators and the
                             Kain-Fritsch ``cu_*`` persistence (NCA
                             timers, held rates, RAINC)
``state.physics.<attr>``     held coupled tendencies (pbl/radiation/
                             cumulus), ``rthratenlw``/``rthratensw``,
                             ``_pending_rainbl``, and the ``fields`` dict
                             -- 88 to 162 surface/soil/snow/PBL arrays
``state.physics.<scheme>``   KF's ``w0avg``, legacy-RRTMG's ``_o33d_grid``
===========================  ==========================================

``woof/io/restart.py`` already classifies every one of them, and its
classification is ENFORCED: ``_driver_manifest`` raises
``RestartManifestError`` for any driver attribute that is neither serialized
nor rebuilt, and ``state_manifest`` does the same for state attributes.  So
this module does not build a list.  It CALLS restart's manifest builders and
uses the result.  A field added to woof tomorrow appears here the day it is
added, and an unclassified one raises instead of being silently dropped.

but its ALLOCATION is 271.65 B/cell in the MYNN+Noah-MP stack, below mp18.

FOUR THINGS THAT ARE NOT ARRAYS
-------------------------------
1. ``state.elapsed_seconds`` decides every physics cadence.
   ``PhysicsDriver.compute`` (woof/core/physics.py:3399) computes
   ``itimestep = floor(elapsed/dt + 0.5) + 1`` and every due test
   (``_radiation_step_due``, ``_surface_pbl_step_due``,
   ``_cumulus_step_due``) is a function of it.  ``dycore.step`` advances it
   by ``dt`` per call (dycore.py:2474), so a tile buffer reused for k tiles
   in a sweep advances k*dt while the DOMAIN advances dt.  Two tiles in the
   same sweep then evaluate different due flags and integrate different
   physics.  :func:`set_carrier_scalars` exists to stop that.
2. ``driver.call_counts`` / ``ysu_nan_guard_fires`` /
   ``microphysics_updates``.  ``microphysics_updates == 0`` is the
   documented "first call" authority for NSSL mp18 and gates whether RRTMGP
   trusts the effective radii (rrtmgp.py:1973), so it is not a diagnostic.
3. ``driver.carriers`` -- the surface-radiation carrier contract's
   records (:mod:`woof.core.radiation_carriers`): per carrier, who wrote
   it and at what model second.  The freshness law reads it immediately
   before every land-surface call, and a tile buffer's OWN records
   describe the buffer's build, not the domain: a fresh ``TiledRun`` at
   domain hour N would otherwise consume hour-N fields under stamps from
   the buffer's local t=0 and refuse the run as stale
   (MEASURED: the 2.0 streamed twin died at model second 3620, first
   step of its second frame).  :func:`carrier_scalars` carries the
   records with the clock; :func:`set_carrier_scalars` restores them
   through :func:`merge_carrier_records`.
4. ``refl_10cm_due``, threaded into ``step()`` by the model's own caller.
   MEASURED trajectory-inert (four steps, True vs False, identical carrier
   digest ``492581bfa65bdd2b``) -- but it must still be uniform across
   tiles, and the stash raises ``REFL_10CM stash was not consumed before
   reuse`` if set on consecutive steps with no output consumer.

THE SOIL/SNOW CARRIERS: SUPPORTED, BUT ONLY IF YOU PASS ``nz``
--------------------------------------------------------------
Noah's soil arrays lead with 4, Noah-MP's snow arrays with 3 and ``zsnsoxy``
with 7 -- none of them ``nz`` or ``nz+1``.  ``gather`` carries them: they are
horizontal windows whose leading axis is not vertical, the easiest case the
transport has, and the whole leading axis rides along untouched.

It is OPT-IN, and the switch is passing ``nz`` explicitly::

    driver.run_tiled(store, cfg, ..., nz=int(cfg.nz),
                     inventory_fn=physics_inventory.carrier_inventory)

``gather.gather_tile`` sets ``layers_ok = nz is not None``.  WITHOUT ``nz``
the transport must assume every leading axis is vertical -- it has nothing
else to go on -- so ``classify`` refuses the soil arrays and
``domain_extents`` raises rather than inferring ``nz = 3`` from a soil layer
count.  That refusal is the transport protecting itself, NOT a missing
capability, and :func:`unsupported_shapes` reports the same thing under the
same rule.

This distinction has already cost real time: a measurement lane read an
earlier version of this docstring -- which said these were "hard failures
today" -- called the transport without ``nz``, reproduced the refusal, and
reported that full physics could not be streamed on any machine.  The gate
streams all 229 carriers of ``full+MYNN+Noah-MP`` bit-exact against a
monolithic run and has since commit 9add26a; see ``test_gate.physics_case``,
which passes ``nz=int(cfg.nz)`` for exactly this reason.

    * the comparison scope is the WHOLE :func:`carrier_manifest`, not
      STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS, so scratch accumulators and driver arrays are
      no longer invisible;
    * the probe states are built with a ``PhysicsDriver`` attached.

    ``streamed=None`` (the default) tests the whole manifest -- the claim
    this module makes.  Pass a subset to test a smaller candidate; every
    subset tried so far fails, which is the point.

    ``nsteps`` defaults to 8, not 2, on this project's own precedent: the
    minimum halo was certified wrong twice by tests at N<=3.  A shorter run
    can accidentally pass -- at ``radt=12 min, cudt=5 min, bldt=0`` a 2-step
    run passes with the scalar carriers dropped, purely because no cadence
    boundary falls inside it.
