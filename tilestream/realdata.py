"""REAL initial conditions into a pinned host store, one row slab at a time.

Every gate in this prototype until now has run on a seeded synthetic state --
``harness.make_state`` draws from ``numpy.random.default_rng`` and calls it
weather.  That proves the TRANSPORT and it proves the halo, but a forecast you
cannot initialise is not a forecast, and nothing in the streaming lane had ever
seen a GRIB file.  This module is the route from real data to the pinned host
store, and the constraint it exists to satisfy is the one that makes the whole
project non-trivial:

    THE DOMAIN IS LARGER THAN VRAM, SO THE INGEST MAY NEVER MATERIALISE A
    FULL-DOMAIN ``DomainState`` ON THE DEVICE.

``woof``'s production ingest does exactly that, on purpose, and is right to:
every existing caller runs a domain that fits.  Read the path before changing
it.


WHAT ARWEN DOES TODAY (measured, not inferred)
----------------------------------------------
Two front doors reach the same three stages.

``woof.runtime.prepare_real_case``
    the production one.  Builds the geogrid statics
    (``runtime._cached_static_build`` -> ``woof.static.build.build_static``),
    decodes each forcing time, interpolates it, calls ``initialize_real``,
    accumulates the perimeter frames into ``StateBoundaryFrames``, builds the
    soil/landuse state and constructs a ``PhysicsDriver``.

``woof.verify.cases.real74_d01.build_forcing``
    the frozen dynamics-only one.  Same three stages with the statics replaced
    by the bundle's own ``geo_em`` HGT_M/MAPFAC/F/E/SIN/COSALPHA, no soil and
    no physics driver.  This module reproduces THAT one, because it is the
    smallest path that is still real data end to end.

The three stages, and what each one costs on a domain of ``ny x nx``:

1.  DECODE.  ``woof.ingest.grib.cached_era5_snapshots(grib, vtable)`` shells
    out to the packaged Rust bridge and returns one ``Era5Snapshot`` per valid
    time: host float64, shape ``(nlevel, nlat, nlon)`` on the SOURCE grid.
    MEASURED on the April-1974 bundle: 37 levels x 121 x 201, 22 fields, three
    valid times, from a 29 MB GRIB.  **The source is bounded by the SOURCE
    grid and does not grow with the target domain at all** -- this stage is
    already out-of-core-safe and needs nothing.

2.  HORIZONTAL.  ``woof.ingest.horiz.interpolate_era5_to_lambert(snapshot,
    grid)`` evaluates ``grid.latlon_mass()/latlon_u()/latlon_v()``, builds one
    interpolation plan per staggering and applies it to every field.  Output
    is CuPy FP32 at TARGET shape: ``(nlevel, ny, nx)`` and the two staggered
    wind variants.  **This is O(target) and it is on the device.**

3.  VERTICAL + STATE.  ``woof.ingest.real.initialize_real(met, cfg, coord,
    terrain)`` does the WRF-real column work in float64 on the host, allocates
    ``DomainState(cfg)`` at FULL domain shape and uploads.  **This is O(target)
    twice over -- once in the host float64 intermediates, once in the device
    state.**

Stage 3 is the wall.  At ``real74_d01``'s own 250x200x49 the device high-water
of stages 2+3 is 0.68 GiB; it is linear in ``ny*nx``, so the same code at
4000x4000 asks for 217.5 GiB of VRAM before a single step runs.


WHAT THIS MODULE DOES INSTEAD
-----------------------------
Stages 2 and 3 are run on a ROW SLAB of the target domain and the slab's state
is written straight into the pinned host store's window.  Nothing full-domain
is ever allocated anywhere except the pinned store itself, which is the point
of the store.  Peak device residency becomes a function of the slab height,
which the caller chooses, and NOT of the domain.

Three facts make that exact rather than approximate, and each one is a way
this could have been faked:

*   THE WINDOW GRID IS THE PARENT'S OWN ARITHMETIC.  :func:`window_grid` is
    ``ProjectedGrid.translated(i0, j0)`` -- which delegates ``ij_to_latlon(x,
    y)`` to the reference grid at ``(x + i0, y + j0)`` -- with the extents
    reduced to the window.  A slab therefore evaluates the projection at the
    PARENT's indices through the PARENT's floats, so ``latlon_mass``,
    ``mapfac_u``, ``mapfac_v``, ``coriolis_m`` and ``rotation_m`` come out
    bit-identical to the parent's slice.  MEASURED: all ten arrays
    ``np.array_equal`` against the parent slice, in both axes.  Rebuilding a
    ``LambertGrid`` from the slab's own extents does NOT do this --
    ``projection.py:122-123`` defaults the reference point to the domain
    centre, so a rebuilt slab believes it sits where the whole domain sits.
    That is the same bug ``driver.geography_inventory`` exists to prevent, one
    stage earlier.

*   THE SLAB CARRIES A ONE-ROW HALO IN Y, AND ONLY BECAUSE OF ``VV``.
    ``initialize_real`` is column-local everywhere except two lines:
    ``real.py:1930`` ``_pressure_at_u`` averages the mass-point dry pressure
    onto x faces and ``:1939`` ``_pressure_at_v`` averages it onto y faces
    (one-sided copies at the domain edge).  A row slab spans the full x
    extent, so ``_pressure_at_u`` never crosses a slab seam; ``_pressure_at_v``
    does, and the v-face target pressure at the slab's first row needs the
    mass row BELOW it.  :data:`SLAB_Y_HALO` is that one row.  It is not a
    guess and it is not a safety margin: ``y_halo=0`` is a negative control in
    :mod:`tilestream.test_realdata` and it fails on ``state/v`` alone, at
    exactly one row per interior seam.

*   THE WRITE-BACK IS STAGGERING-AWARE.  A mass field's slab owns global rows
    ``[j0, j1)``; a v-staggered field's slab owns ``[j0, j1)`` too, except the
    LAST slab, which additionally owns the closing face ``ny``.  Getting that
    wrong writes real numbers into the wrong rows and leaves no trace -- the
    field is still finite, still smooth, still plausible.
    :func:`window_rows` is the single place that decides it and
    :mod:`tilestream.test_realdata` drives it wrong three ways on purpose.


WHAT A SLAB IS NOT ALLOWED TO SEE
---------------------------------
``initialize_real`` raises on a non-positive dry column mass and on a
non-monotonic hybrid pressure column, both per column, so a slab reaches the
same verdict as the domain for the columns it holds -- a slab ingest cannot
accept a domain the monolithic one refuses, or the other way round.

One WART, recorded rather than hidden: those refusals name a ROW, and
``real.py``'s ``hybrid_column_ordering_refusal(..., row_offset=)`` seam is
reachable only from ``_make_real_base``'s own threading, not from
``initialize_real``'s argument list.  A slab therefore reports the row index
WITHIN THE SLAB.  Nothing computes wrongly because of it and no state is
affected; a reader chasing a refusal has to add ``slab.g0`` by hand.  Fixing
it means threading a ``row_offset`` through ``initialize_real``, which is a
change to production ingest and not to this lane.


THE PERIODIC CLOSURE, stated plainly because it is the one thing here that
edits real data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The bit-exact tiled lane is periodic (``spec.TileSpec._axis_gather`` reduces
every window mod ``nx``), and a periodic domain is only self-consistent when
the closing faces alias the opening ones: ``u[..., nx] == u[..., 0]`` and
``v[..., ny, :] == v[..., 0, :]``.  ``woof.verify.npref`` enforces exactly
that on its seeded states; real ERA5 winds on a CONUS Lambert grid do not
satisfy it, because the domain is not periodic.  :func:`periodic_closure`
imposes it, and the streaming comparison applies it to BOTH sides -- it cannot
manufacture agreement, it only removes an alias ambiguity that a periodic
gate would otherwise report as a transport bug.  It is the only edit this
module makes to ingested values, and a real forecast with specified lateral
boundaries would not make it.


WHAT A LARGER-THAN-VRAM DOMAIN NEEDS THAT A SMALLER ONE DOES NOT
----------------------------------------------------------------

figure is per mass cell and multiplies straight out to any size.

=============================================  ===========  =================

Read that table as five separate statements.

1.  DECODE NEEDS NOTHING.  786 B/cell is 37.5 MiB divided by THIS domain's
    cells; the snapshot is 37 levels x 121 x 201 on the ERA5 grid and does
    not grow with the target at all.  A 4000x4000 target decodes the same
    37.5 MiB.  Nothing to do.

2.  THE INGEST IS THE WALL, AND SLABS MOVE IT.  14.6 kB/cell of VRAM at
    monolithic is 217.5 GiB at 4000x4000 -- before a single step.  Cut into
    single rows it is 1.63 kB/cell, and even that is not per cell: it is the
    ~76 MiB fixed cost of the CUDA context, the interpolation plans and the
    source grid, which does not grow with the domain either.  The DOMAIN-
    dependent part of the slab path is ``O(rows_per_slab * nx)`` and the
    caller sets ``rows_per_slab``.  That is the whole result.

3.  THE HOST SIDE HAS ITS OWN WALL AND IT IS NOT SMALL.  ``RealInitResult``
    RETAINS 3.2 kB/cell of float64 after ``initialize_real`` returns --
    ``dry_pressure``, ``total_pressure``, ``total_geopotential``,
    ``total_specific_volume`` at 392-400 B/cell each, plus the whole
    ``BaseState`` again at 1 592 B/cell.  A caller that keeps the result (and
    ``prepare_real_case`` keeps ``initial_result`` for the entire run) is
    holding 47.7 GiB at 4000x4000 in ORDINARY host memory, on top of the
    pinned store.  The slab loop drops each slab's copy before building the
    next, which is why it never appears in the high-water column.

4.  THE BOUNDARIES ARE ALREADY FINE.  ``ingest.lateral_bc.
    StateBoundaryFrames`` keeps only the four ``spec_bdy_width`` perimeter
    strips per forcing time.  MEASURED, all three real74 forcing times:
    26 699 520 B, which reads as 534 B/cell here but is really
    **121.09 B per BOUNDARY cell** over ``2 * (nx + ny) * spec_bdy_width *
    nz`` of them -- so it costs ``O(perimeter)`` and its share of the domain
    SHRINKS as the domain grows: 534 B/cell at 250x200 becomes 29.7 B/cell
    at 4000x4000, where the whole three-time boundary set is 0.44 GiB.  What
    it still WANTS is a whole state to slice from; a slab world hands it each
    slab's contribution to the west/east strips and the first/last slab's
    south/north strips, which is arithmetic, not a redesign.

5.  WHAT STILL ASSUMES A RESIDENT STATE, named so nobody has to re-find it:

    ``runtime._cached_static_build`` -> ``static.build.build_static``
        the geogrid statics: 14 arrays, 776 B/cell, ALL float64 and all on
        the host.  Three of them are twelve months deep (``GREENFRAC``,
        ``LAI12M``, ``ALBEDO12M``, 96 B/cell each) and three are category
        fractions (``LANDUSEF`` 21 deep at 168 B/cell, ``SOILCTOP`` and
        ``SOILCBOT`` 16 deep at 128 B/cell each) -- so 92% of the bill is six
        arrays, and at 4000x4000 the set is 11.6 GiB of host RAM.  It is
        driven entirely by the grid, so :func:`window_grid` slabs it the same
        way this module slabs the analysis -- but ``_cached_static_build``'s
        ``lru_cache`` is keyed on the grid, so a slabbed caller would hold one
        cache entry per SLAB, which is a cache that grows with the domain.
    ``core.physics.initialize_physics``
        builds the whole ``PhysicsDriver`` on the device: 88 to 162
        surface/soil/snow arrays plus the scheme tables, 229 B/cell of
        carriers at the real74 rung.  A physics-on out-of-core ingest has to
        build it per slab and scatter ``fields/*`` into the store exactly as
        this module scatters ``state/*``; the tile buffers already own their
        own driver, so nothing about the STEP path needs it resident.
    ``core.landuse.initialize_landuse(..., cen_lat=...)``
        takes a DOMAIN scalar to pick the LANDUSE.TBL season and flips it
        south of the equator (landuse.py:327, :389).  A slab must be handed
        the domain's ``cen_lat``, never its own, or a domain straddling the
        equator gets summer tables in one slab and winter in the next.
        ``driver.py`` records the same trap one stage later, for tiles.
    ``ingest.real.hydrostatic_residual`` and ``runtime.write_case_output``
        full-domain readers.  Diagnostics and output, not ingest.

    caller passes the same inventory function to both ends -- and a key
    present on one side only is an error, not a skip.

    The copy is ``cudaMemcpy3D``, through ``gather``'s own resolved-block
    machinery, and it has to be.  The destination is a ROW WINDOW of a
    full-domain array, which for any 3-D field is strided in the leading axis;
    ``cupy.ndarray.get(out=...)`` refuses a non-contiguous ``out`` outright
    (measured: ``RuntimeError: 'out' cannot be specified when copying to
    non-contiguous ndarray``), and the obvious workaround -- ``cupy.asnumpy``

    of the slab in PAGEABLE host memory and moves every byte twice.  On a

    ``rdnw``, ``dn``, ``rdn``, ``fnp``, ``fnm``, ``cf1..cfn1`` -- are
    deliberately NOT gathered (``driver.geography_inventory``'s docstring: a
    tile rebuilds them exactly).  A buffer built on the default stretch
    therefore rebuilds them WRONG, and nothing in the pipeline would notice:
    the arrays are the right shape and the right dtype and the run produces
    plausible weather.  ``coord_fn()`` is the domain's own coordinate
    factory, so the buffer rebuilds the same table.

    ``run_tiled`` does NOT check this -- ``driver.setup_window_mismatches``
    and ``driver.setup_scalar_mismatches`` exist but nothing calls them from
    the run path -- so :mod:`tilestream.test_realdata` calls both directly on
    a real buffer against a real parent, and runs a buffer built on the
    default stretch as a negative control.  MEASURED: the default stretch
    puts ``znu`` up to 0.1763 away from the case's table, disagrees on all
    sixteen vertical setup arrays and on the five ``cf*`` scalars, and the
    streamed eight-step answer then differs in ten of the thirteen carriers
    by up to 4.5e5.

    The base state is the WRF analytic one ``initialize_real`` itself uses
    (``woof.ingest.real._make_real_base``), on a CONSTANT terrain: identical
    machinery so every vertical scalar matches by construction, obviously
    wrong horizontally so a geography array the gather misses shows up as
    flat ground rather than as somebody else's mountains.
