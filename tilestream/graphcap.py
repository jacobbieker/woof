"""CUDA graph capture of the tiled step: pay the launch cost once, not per tile.

WOOF's step issues ~1,203 kernel launches and the profile in PERF-SURVEY.md
measures a 26% dead gap between them -- 6.34 us of idle per launch against
24.1 us of device work.  That gap is host submission cost, and a tiled sweep
pays it ONCE PER TILE: the same 1,203 launches are re-issued for every tile in
the plan, so an 8x8 tiling submits 77,000 launches to do one domain-step's
worth of arithmetic.  It is worst exactly where the streaming lane hurts most,
on the small compute windows a 12 GB card is forced into, because a small
window shrinks the device work per launch without shrinking the launch.

A CUDA graph replaces the whole submission sequence with one
``cuGraphLaunch``.  This module captures a tile's step once and replays it for
every other tile.  The per-tile sequence is IDENTICAL -- same config, same
buffer, same arrays, only the gathered *contents* differ -- which is what
makes the tiled loop a better graph candidate than the resident loop it was
proposed for.

Nothing here changes arithmetic.  A replayed graph re-executes the recorded
kernels on the recorded pointers; the gate's job is to prove that claim rather
than accept it, and ``tilestream.test_gate`` runs every rung through this path
with ``--graph``.


THE FOUR WAYS THIS GOES SILENTLY WRONG
--------------------------------------
Each one is a real failure that was hit, reproduced, or defended against here,
and each has a mechanism in this module that answers it.  A graph that
replays stale work does not crash: it produces a plausible forecast.

1. **An empty capture.**  ``Stream.begin_capture()`` does NOT redirect CuPy's
   launches on its own.  The stream must also be made CURRENT (``with s:``),
   and PERF-FINDINGS records a sweep that reported a fake 99.9% speedup
   because capture without it produced an empty graph that launched, did
   nothing, and raised nothing.  :func:`capture_step` therefore refuses a
   graph whose node count is below :data:`MIN_PLAUSIBLE_NODES`, and records
   the node count in every report.

2. **A stale step.**  Two ways, and the second is the one that surprises.
   Radiation, the surface/PBL bundle and cumulus fire on a CADENCE, so
   replaying a no-radiation graph on a radiation-due step silently drops the
   heating; :func:`cadence_key` asks the driver's own predicates about that.
   And a graph bakes in every kernel's scalar ARGUMENTS, several of which
   are the absolute model time -- RRTMGP's solar hour angle above all -- so
   a graph is not re-usable across steps even when the cadence agrees.  The
   default therefore keys on the SWEEP as well, which is exactly the reuse a
   tiled run needs and no more: one capture per step, replayed once per
   tile.  ``graph_reuse="run"`` lifts that and the gate runs it as a
   negative control, where it is caught by 33 differing carriers at maxabs
   2.0e+04.  MEASURED, not assumed -- and note the consequence for the
   cadence key: under sweep keying the sweep index already separates every
   step, so the cadence half of the key only becomes essential under
   ``reuse="run"``.

3. **Stale HOST state.**  A replay executes device work only.  Every Python
   side effect a step has -- the clock, the call counters, an array rebound
   on the driver -- happens at CAPTURE time and never again.  If any of that
   feeds the next step, replaying is wrong.  This module does not assume it
   does not: :func:`capture_step` captures the same step several times from
   the same clock and requires the array SHAPES, the scalar CARRIERS and
   object identity (as a set) to settle.  What settles is replayable; what
   does not is refused, with the attribute named.  The scalar carriers are
   then re-applied after every replay as the increment the capture measured
   (:attr:`StepGraph.scalars_delta`), because the tiled driver's sweep
   bookkeeping reads them.  Diagnostic counters that move every step and
   feed nothing -- RRTMGP's ``update_count``, Kain-Fritsch's cached history
   -- are reported as drift and allowed: the tiled driver ALREADY
   desynchronises exactly those from the domain, a buffer serving k tiles
   advancing them k times a sweep, and the gate has proved rung by rung that
   the forecast does not depend on them.

4. **Pointer reuse across concurrent graphs.**  A graph bakes in the
   addresses of the temporaries the step allocated while it was being
   captured.  CuPy hands those addresses back to its pool at the end of the
   capture, so the NEXT capture -- buffer 1's, say -- gets the same
   addresses, and then buffer 0 and buffer 1 replay concurrently on two
   streams into ONE set of scratch buffers.  The answer is wrong and nothing
   reports it.  Every :class:`GraphStepper` -- one per tile buffer --
   therefore owns a PRIVATE ``cupy.cuda.MemoryPool`` that its captures run
   under and that outlives them; the blocks stay reserved to that pool, so
   no other allocation can be handed them.  Never call ``free_all_blocks``
   on it: that returns the addresses to the driver while the graph still
   points at them, which is the same corruption with an extra step.


WHAT IS NOT CAPTURABLE, AND WHY THAT IS A LIST AND NOT A SHRUG
--------------------------------------------------------------
Capture fails, loudly, on any host/device transfer or synchronisation, which
is the same thing as saying it fails on any host branch over device data.
Measured over the gate's fourteen physics rungs at 64x64x49 (each rung in its
own process, first failure only):

===========================  ==========================================

===========================  ==========================================
dry                          none -- captures and replays
mp10 Morrison .. +sfclay     ``microphysics.py`` status readback
+YSU PBL                     ``ysu.py`` status readback
+Noah LSM .. full+NSSL       ``noah.py`` per-step upload of a CONSTANT table
full fast cadence            ``rrtmgp.py`` status readback, then two more
                             constant uploads, then ``physics.py``'s
                             per-output finite check
full+Noah-MP                 ``noahmp_runtime.py`` per-step latitude upload
full+MYNN                    ``mynn_pbl_gpu.py`` per-chunk guard readbacks
===========================  ==========================================

:mod:`woof.core.health_ledger` answers the status readbacks (they are
error-only: on a healthy run nothing downstream reads them, so they can be
accumulated on the device and drained at a synchronisation the caller already
pays for).  The constant uploads are memoised at their sites.  With those
done, ELEVEN of the fourteen rungs capture, including the ship config
``full(real74) +KF`` at 876 nodes and the radiation-every-step lane at 1,414
to 1,471 nodes.  Three do not:

``full+MYNN`` (and ``full+MYNN+Noah-MP``)
    ``mynn_pbl_gpu._flag_mask`` reads a block of validation words back to the
    host once per guard group per COLUMN CHUNK -- so a domain walked in
    chunks pays a multiple of them per step.  Every one of them is
    error-only, exactly like the four sites the ledger already covers, so
    this is the same mechanical change again and nothing more.

``full+Noah-MP``
    ``noahmp_runtime._lsm_step_slab`` uploads the latitude grid and the soil
    coordinate every step (cacheable), and then does something that is not
    just an upload: ``cp.nonzero`` over the land mask, ``cp.asnumpy`` of the
    land columns' vegetation and soil identity, and ``np.unique`` on the host
    to build the parameter rows -- a data-dependent gather whose size the
    host has to know, EVERY STEP.  The inputs are static geography, so the
    index and the row table are cacheable across the whole run, and that is
    worth doing for its own sake.  It is a Noah-MP change and not a graph
    change.

``use_graph=True`` falls back to stream launching for those, reports the
reason, and stays bit-exact; the gate runs ``full+MYNN+Noah-MP`` as a
positive case precisely to prove that the fallback is exact and that it
really is falling back.

    The capture does not execute anything: it records.  The caller must
    launch the returned graph to actually perform the step -- which is the

    silently drops a step.

    ``verify_host=True`` (the default, and the reason this is not four lines)
    captures the same step SEVERAL times from the same clock and requires the
    result to settle.  Two distinct things come out of that, and the second
    was found by running it rather than by thinking about it.

    **The fixed-point check.**  A replay executes device work only, so
    replaying is sound only if repeating the step leaves the HOST state where
    it already is.  Two captures from the same clock must therefore produce
    the same host fingerprint; a graph that fails is refused, and the message
    names the attribute that moved.

    **The settling capture.**  MEASURED, on the dry lane at a 224 window: the
    first capture of a fresh tile buffer had 241 nodes and the second 232.
    The nine extra were the memsets of arrays the step allocates LAZILY --
    ``state.scratch`` slots that did not exist until the first step asked for
    them.  Capture allocates them (that is host-side Python and it really
    runs) but only RECORDS their zeroing, so a graph captured second, cached
    and replayed would leave that scratch holding whatever the pool last put
    there.  Worse in the other direction too: caching the FIRST graph would
    re-zero, every tile, scratch that legitimately carries information across
    steps -- ``state._scratch`` is in the streamed carrier manifest precisely
    because it does.  So when the first capture differs from the second, the
    first is kept as a one-shot ``settle`` graph that is launched exactly
    once (performing this step, zeroing included) and the SETTLED graph is
    what gets cached.  That is what the stream path does: zero on first use,

    # Capture up to four times from the SAME clock and require the result to
    # settle.  Three separate things come out of the sequence and every one
    # of them was found by running it, not by thinking about it.

    # 1. A SETTLING capture.  The first capture of a fresh buffer allocates
    #    whatever the step allocates lazily and records the memsets that zero
    #    it; the second does not.  Measured on the dry lane at a 224 window:

    #
    # 2. What must be STATIONARY, and what need not be.  A replay updates
    #    device memory and runs no Python, so the question is which host
    #    state going stale would change an answer.  Three things are checked
    #    and they are the three that can:
    #      * the SHAPES.  If a step's second execution allocates a
    #        differently shaped bundle, the graph's baked pointers describe
    #        the wrong array.  Fatal.
    #      * the SCALAR CARRIERS.  These are the project's own answer to
    #        "which host state is trajectory-relevant" -- the domain clock
    #        and the call counters every physics cadence is a function of --
    #        and a replay re-applies their increment, so the increment has to
    #        be the same every time.  Fatal if it is not.
    #      * OBJECT IDENTITY, but only for repeats.  With ``bldt=0`` the PBL
    #        slot builds a fresh ``PhysicsTendencies`` every step and the
    #        driver rebinds to it; that replays correctly, because the
    #        graph's pointers and the driver's attribute agree with each
    #        other and the bundle is written before it is read.  A driver
    #        that PING-PONGED between two bundles would look identical after
    #        two captures and be wrong on every second replay, so an identity
    #        that comes BACK is fatal while an identity that merely moves is
    #        not.
    #    Everything else that moves -- ``RRTMGPRadiation.update_count``,
    #    Kain-Fritsch's ``_history_time`` -- is reported as drift and
    #    allowed, because the tiled driver ALREADY desynchronises exactly
    #    those from the domain (a buffer serving k tiles advances them k
    #    times per sweep while the domain advances once) and the gate has
    #    proved, rung by rung, that the forecast does not depend on them.
    #    Refusing them would refuse every physics rung for a reason the gate

@dataclass
class GraphStepper:
    """Capture-once/replay-per-tile for ONE tile buffer.

    The tiled loop calls :meth:`run` where it used to call ``dycore.step``.
    The first tile a buffer serves at a given key pays a capture; every later
    tile under that key pays one ``cuGraphLaunch``.

    ``reuse``, and why the default is the cautious one
        A graph bakes in every kernel's scalar ARGUMENTS as well as its
        pointers, and several schemes pass the absolute model time as one:
        RRTMGP takes ``xtime``/``julian`` for the solar geometry
        (rrtmgp.py:2045, :2201), Noah takes ``itimestep``, Noah-MP takes the
        Julian day.  A graph captured at time t and replayed at time t + dt
        would silently re-use t's sun.  So the default,
        ``reuse="sweep"``, puts the CLOCK in the cache key: one capture per
        step, replayed for every tile of that step.  That is the whole win
        for tiling -- the launch cost is what is multiplied by the tile
        count -- and it costs nothing in soundness.

        ``reuse="run"`` keys on the cadence flags alone and so re-uses a
        graph across steps.  It is much cheaper -- MEASURED at 96x80 with
        2x2 tiles, N=8: 2 captures totalling 130 ms instead of 16 totalling
        423 ms -- and it is correct only for a configuration whose kernels
        take no absolute time.  Which configurations those are is a
        measurement and not a guess.  At 48x40 tiles, N=8, against the
        monolithic answer::

            reuse   rung                     result
            sweep   every rung tried         BIT-EXACT
            run     mp10 Morrison            BIT-EXACT
            run     +YSU PBL                 BIT-EXACT
            run     full(real74) +KF         BIT-EXACT   (radt 12 min:
                                                          radiation fires on
                                                          1 step in 240 and
                                                          not inside this run)
            run     full fast cadence        MISMATCH    (radt 0.05 min:
                                                          radiation fires
                                                          EVERY step and the
                                                          solar hour angle is
                                                          baked in)

        So the accurate rule is that ``reuse="run"`` is safe for exactly as
        long as no radiation-due step is inside the run, which is not a
        property a config can promise.  The default stays ``"sweep"``; a
        caller who knows the run is short and radiation is not due can take
        the cheaper key with their eyes open, and the fast-cadence row is
        what a wrong guess looks like.

    ``mode``
        ``"auto"`` falls back to stream launching when a step cannot be
        captured, and records why.  ``"require"`` raises instead -- which is
        what a benchmark wants, because a benchmark that silently measures
        the fallback measures nothing.

    ``key_fn``
        :func:`cadence_key`, or a deliberately broken one.  The gate passes
        ``lambda *_: ("fixed",)`` as a negative control: one graph for every
        step regardless of cadence, which must FAIL at a rung whose
        radiation or cumulus fires part-way through the run.

    ``replay_scalars``
        Re-apply the scalar-carrier increment the capture measured.  A
        replay runs no Python, so without this the buffer's clock and call
        counters stay at the pre-step values.  The gate turns it off as the
        second negative control.

    One memory pool serves ALL of a stepper's graphs, and that is deliberate
    in both directions: two graphs of the SAME buffer never run at the same
    time (they belong to different steps, and the sweep synchronises between
    steps), so sharing addresses between them is safe; two graphs of
    DIFFERENT buffers do run at the same time, which is why the pool lives on
    the stepper and a stepper serves one buffer.
