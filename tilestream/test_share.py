"""THE SHARING GATE: one workspace for every buffer must change no answer.

Run it::

    python -m tilestream.test_share           # from the repository root

:mod:`tilestream.shared_workspace` takes 98.2% of a tile buffer's device
footprint away from the buffer and gives it to the run.  That is a large
saving and it is exactly the shape of change that produces a plausible wrong
answer: nothing crashes, nothing warns, and two tiles quietly integrate
through each other's scratch.  So the saving is worth nothing without this
file.

THE POSITIVE ROWS
-----------------
Every shared configuration is compared to the SAME monolithic reference the
bit-exact gate uses (``test_gate.physics_reference``), over the whole restart
manifest, by SHA-256 per field.  Not close: identical.

THE NEGATIVE ROWS, AND WHAT EACH ONE IS FOR
-------------------------------------------
* ``chain_compute=False`` -- THE CONTROL THIS WORKSTREAM OWES.  Each buffer
  owns a non-blocking stream and nothing orders tile *i*'s ``step`` against
  tile *i+1*'s, so with one shared arena the two write the same bytes while
  both are live.  On a dry 192x192 domain split 3x3, on an RTX 5090, that is
  reproducible and total: ALL NINE carriers differ, four runs out of four,
  and the same configuration with the chain on is bit-exact.

  ON AN RTX 4090 THE SAME RUN IS BIT-EXACT, and the first version of this
  file asserted the mismatch unconditionally and therefore FAILED on the
  4090 -- for the code being safe.  Whether two tiles overlap is a property
  of the card: a 96x96x49 tile already occupies the whole 4090, so the
  second stream's blocks cannot be co-scheduled, while the 5090 has room for
  both.  A control that only watches the ANSWER cannot tell "safe" from "the
  hazard did not happen to fire here", and calling the 4090 safe on that
  evidence is exactly the shape of the six false results this project has
  already produced.

  So the control watches the MECHANISM.  ``run_tiled(timeline=True)`` records
  a CUDA event either side of every tile's ``step`` and reports how many
  tiles began before their predecessor finished.  The rows then assert:

    - with the chain: bit-exact AND zero overlapping steps.  That is the
      safety property, it is checkable on every card, and it is the one that
      licenses the sharing.
    - without the chain: if the timeline shows overlap, the answer MUST have
      changed; if it shows none, the row is reported VACUOUS on this card
      rather than passing quietly.

  At full physics the chain-off configuration matches on both cards, because
  ``dycore.step`` at that rung host-synchronises inside the physics guards --
  RRTMGP's single validation D2H (rrtmgp.py:1620) and the finite checks in
  ``_validated_array`` -- so the host cannot enqueue tile *i+1* until tile
  *i*'s kernels have run.  :func:`main` reports that as a DIAGNOSTIC and
  asserts nothing from it.

* a CARRYING slot forced into the arena -- ``mp_rainnc`` and friends are
  accumulators: they are read, added to, and written, so a second buffer
  sharing their storage destroys the first buffer's total.  The lifetime
  audit in ``woof.core.preflight`` excludes them by name, and this row
  proves that exclusion is doing work rather than being decorative.  It is
  the difference between "the arena is safe" and "the arena's ADMISSION RULE
  is safe".

* poison between tiles -- the inverse control, and the one that must PASS.
  Every arena slot is filled with NaN between tiles; a slot that genuinely
  carried something across the tile boundary turns into NaN and every
  downstream field with it.  Bit-exactness under poisoning is direct
  evidence that nothing live crosses the boundary, as opposed to the
  indirect evidence of "it matched anyway".

WHY THE TILE PLAN IS 4x4 AND NOT 2x1
------------------------------------
A negative control that shares a workspace only needs TWO buffers to be
wrong, but it needs enough tiles for the wrongness to reach the comparison.
The plan here is the gate's own 256x192 four-by-four (FACT 1's geometry), so
16 tiles pass through ``nbuffers`` buffers and every buffer is reused four
times.
