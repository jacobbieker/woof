"""THE FRONT DOOR: a forecast that streams because its TOML said so.

``tilestream/test_join.py`` proves that a real forecast configuration is
bit-exact when streamed.  It proves it through a loop of its own -- the
model's loop with the output, restart and nest ops removed -- and through a
builder of its own, defined inside the test.  Neither of those is what a user
runs, and the gap between them was total:

    ``woof/prepared_single_domain_forecast.py`` and
    ``woof/prepared_domain_tree_forecast.py``, the only two routes the CLI
    can launch a forecast through, both called
    ``streaming.steppers_for_tree(model, exp.tiles)`` with NO builders
    argument.  ``make_stepper(..., build=None)`` refuses.  So every
    ``[tiles] mode = "on"`` forecast raised ``StreamingRefused`` and NO
    configuration the front door accepts was capable of streaming.

This module is the gate for closing that.  It builds a WOOF
:class:`~woof.core.model.ExperimentState` out of an experiment TOML the
schema validates, hands it to :func:`woof.core.model.execute_experiment` --
the executor both routes call and the only thing between them and the dycore
-- and runs the same experiment twice through the ROUTES' OWN pair of calls::

    steppers = streaming.steppers_for_tree(
        model, exp.tiles,
        builders=streaming.builders_for_tree(model, exp.tiles))

once with ``[tiles]`` absent and once with ``mode = "on"``, then compares
every carrier.

    python -m tilestream.test_route             # the gate
    python -m tilestream.test_route --quick     # 24 steps, controls only
    python -m tilestream.test_route --steps 120

WHAT THIS GATE ADDS OVER test_join, AND WHY EACH ADDITION IS NOT COSMETIC
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
*The builder is the product's, not the test's.*  ``test_join`` defines
``_make_builder`` inside itself; if that function is the only correct one, a
user has no way to reach it.  Here the builder is
:func:`woof.core.streaming.prepared_domain_builder`, reached through
:func:`~woof.core.streaming.builders_for_tree`, which is what the routes now
call.  A defect in the shipped builder fails this gate; a defect in a test's
private builder never could.

*The loop is the executor's.*  ``execute_experiment`` refreshes the state
clock either side of every STEP, runs the health validators, walks the op
table and trims the pool.  A streamed stepper has to survive all of that,
and one of those interactions is a finding this gate MEASURES rather than
assumes -- see THE FROZEN STATE below.

*The cadence is a real forecast's.*  ``radt = 12 min`` and ``cudt = 5 min``
at ``dt = 30 s`` fire radiation every 24 steps and cumulus every 10, so a
window shorter than about 30 steps gives one side a free ride on the two most
expensive schemes in the stack.  This project has produced three false
results that way.  The fire counts are PRINTED on both sides and a run in
which either side shows zero refuses to report a verdict.

THE FROZEN STATE -- measured here, and it is the reason this gate exists
------------------------------------------------------------------------
With ``store = "host"`` the domain's arrays live in pinned host RAM and the
``DomainState`` the route is holding is a SNAPSHOT taken when the stepper was
attached.  Nothing writes back to it.  ``execute_experiment`` reads
``node.state`` for the health validators, and both routes read it again for
the history frames, the stability gate and the final canonical digest.

So this gate digests ``node.state`` before and after the streamed run as a
first-class result.  It does not assert that they differ or that they agree:
it prints which, because that single fact decides whether the mode is usable
through the front door or only through this gate.

THE CONTROLS
------------
``no builder``          the routes' call without ``builders`` -> must REFUSE
``auto on a fit``       ``mode = "auto"`` on a domain that fits -> must NOT
                        stream, and a gate that reported PASS from that run
                        would be reporting a resident run
``geography rebuilt``   each buffer rebuilds geography from its tile_cfg ->
                        must DIFFER
``tables unwindowed``   every tile gets tile 0's forcing -> must DIFFER
``the clock dropped``   the domain clock is not carried -> must DIFFER
``cadence fired``       radiation and cumulus fire counts, both sides,
                        printed; zero on either side refuses the verdict
