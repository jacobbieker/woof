"""Where the device memory actually goes -- allocation by allocation.

Every VRAM number this project has quoted so far came from one of two places:
``cupy.get_default_memory_pool().used_bytes()`` (a single scalar) or
``cudaMemGetInfo`` (a single scalar that also counts every other process on
the card).  Neither can answer the question this workstream exists to answer,
which is not "how much" but "WHICH ALLOCATION, and would it still be needed if
we did something else".  A category -- "radiation", "physics", "the packer" --
is not an answer either: the survey that produced the 7.4 GiB reclaimable
figure attributed to categories, and a category cannot be freed.

So this module keeps a LIVE LEDGER: every pooled device allocation, its size,
and the source line that asked for it, from the moment the ledger is armed
until the moment each block is returned.  At any point it can say what is
resident right now, broken down by ``file:line``, and it reconciles against
CuPy's own counter -- :meth:`DeviceLedger.check` raises if the ledger's live
sum and ``pool.used_bytes()`` disagree, so a silent gap in the accounting
fails loudly instead of producing a tidy, wrong table.

THE FOUR NUMBERS, AND WHY ALL FOUR ARE NEEDED
---------------------------------------------
==========================  ===============================================
``pool_used``               bytes the program is holding through live CuPy
                            arrays.  This is what a domain-size formula
                            should be built from.
``pool_total``              bytes the pool has taken from the driver and
                            not given back.  Freed-but-retained blocks live
                            in the gap; they are unavailable to any other
                            allocation with a different size class, so they
                            are real occupancy even though nothing points
                            at them.
``device_used``             ``total - free`` from ``cudaMemGetInfo``.  Sees
                            the CUDA context, every JIT-compiled module,
                            cuBLAS/cuFFT handles and any non-pool
                            allocation -- none of which the hook can see.
``ledger_live``             this module's own sum, attributed to source
                            lines.  Must equal ``pool_used``.
==========================  ===============================================

``device_used - pool_total`` is the non-pool device footprint.  On this
codebase it is dominated by the CUDA context plus NVRTC module images, it is
per-PROCESS, and it does not shrink when a domain shrinks -- which is exactly
the kind of fact a per-cell formula hides.

WHAT THE HOOK CAN AND CANNOT SEE
--------------------------------
CuPy calls the hook for pool ``malloc``/``free`` (a logical allocation) and
for ``alloc`` (an actual ``cudaMalloc`` when the pool has to grow).  Both are
recorded and both are attributed, because they answer different questions:
``malloc`` says who ASKED, ``alloc`` says what the card actually gave out.
A site with a large malloc total and a small alloc total is being served from
recycled blocks and costs nothing new; a site with a large alloc total is the
one that grew the pool.

The hook cannot see: the CUDA context, NVRTC module loads, memory allocated
by a library through its own allocator, or pinned HOST memory (that is
:mod:`tilestream.hoststore`'s business).  ``device_used`` catches the first
three in aggregate and nothing catches them individually from inside the
process.

COST
----
One ``traceback.extract_stack`` per pooled allocation.  MEASURED on an RTX
5090 by :func:`measure_ledger_overhead` (20,000 four-byte allocations, best
of three): 1.01 us per pooled allocation bare against 19.08 us armed, a
factor of 18.8.  That is fine for attribution -- the probe's slowest
configuration takes seconds -- and disqualifying inside a timed window, so
nothing in the benchmark path arms a ledger, and :func:`device_snapshot`
(four scalar reads, no hook) is what a timed lane should use if it wants a
number at all.  Re-run :func:`measure_ledger_overhead` rather than trusting
this line on other hardware.
