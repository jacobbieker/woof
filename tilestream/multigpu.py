"""Multi-GPU domain decomposition: each GPU owns a sub-domain, halos move.

This is the sibling of :mod:`tilestream.driver`.  ``run_tiled`` streams every
tile through one GPU; here each GPU PERMANENTLY OWNS a slab of the domain and
only the ``halo``-wide seams cross the PCIe link.  Halo traffic scales with the
perimeter, compute with the area, so the byte count is roughly ``2*halo/T`` of
what streaming the whole tile costs.

THE HEADLINE, so it is not buried in the tables below: this is BIT-EXACT
against a monolithic run, and on 2x RTX 4090 it is **1.99x at 1536^2** and
**1.62x at 768^2**.  The seam is not the problem at two cards -- the exposed
exchange is 4.2 ms/step at 768^2 and 8.1 ms at 1536^2, which is 6% and 3% of
the two-GPU step respectively, a low single-digit percentage at every size
measured.  What limits the small end is halo recompute and a fixed ~3.8 ms
host-side concurrency loss, both of which shrink as the domain grows; see the
attribution table below, which factors all three effects.

THREE FACTS A READER NEEDS BEFORE PLANNING ANYTHING WITH THIS
-------------------------------------------------------------
1. **GeForce has no working P2P.**  ``canAccessPeer == 0`` on 40-series, so
   every halo byte routes through host memory whether you ask it to or not.
   ``cudaMemcpyPeerAsync`` still works and CUDA stages it through its own host
   buffer; that is the transport used here and nothing in this module
   hand-rolls device->host->device.  The measured seam rate, ~10 GB/s per
   direction, IS that staged path -- it is not a P2P number and must not be
   quoted as one, and a datacentre card with real NVLink would not be
   predicted by it in either direction.

2. **Ring mode does NOT parallelise across GPUs.**  :mod:`tilestream.rings`
   removes the shadow store's second copy of the domain, which is the right
   trade for the single-GPU out-of-core lane and is worth nothing here: it was
   measured at 1.00x across all 12 geometries tried, because the ring is a
   memory optimisation on the WRITE path of one sweep and the thing multi-GPU
   needs is two sweeps at once.  Worse, a ring plan makes every already-written
   tile's band a dependency of the next tile, which is exactly the serialising
   structure a decomposition is trying to get rid of.  So multi-GPU wants
   ``write_mode="shadow"``, and ``run_tiled`` refusing a caller-supplied
   shadow under ``write_mode="ring"`` (asserted in the gate) is the guard rail
   that keeps the two from being confused.

3. **At eight cards the exchange IS the scaling loss, and it is 6.1x off the
   PCIe floor.**  An independent reimplementation of this decomposition --
   written from scratch on a rented 8-GPU box, because this file had never
   been committed and could not be found there -- measured 3.72x at 8 GPUs
   with 18/18 configurations bit-exact.  It agrees with this module on the
   PHYSICS and is not a measurement of this code.  What it establishes that
   two cards cannot is where the ceiling comes from: attributing its loss put
   essentially all of it in the exchange, running 6.1x slower than the PCIe
   bandwidth floor for the bytes moved.  That is a transport result, not a
   decomposition result -- the halo volume is what the geometry says it is --
   and it is the number to attack first before anything about the split is
   changed.

PROVENANCE.  This file was never committed.  It lived as a loose file on a
rented box's disk until it was recovered and committed byte-identical; the
commit immediately before this docstring is that rescue.  Every number below
was measured with THIS code on the box named in the heading.

Nothing about the numerics changes.  A sub-domain is stepped exactly the way a
tile is stepped -- as a smaller periodic domain, under its own ``RunConfig``,
with a ``halo``-cell surround whose contents are thrown away and refreshed --
so every fact the single-GPU lane established still holds and is not re-argued
here:

* the halo is ``harness.halo_radius(cfg)`` (16 at ``time_step_sound=4``);
* exactly ONE step happens between exchanges (two on a 16-cell halo fails);
* only the persisted inventory has to move.


THE GEOMETRY, drawn.  ``nx = 8T``-ish, two GPUs, periodic in x
--------------------------------------------------------------
The domain's mass columns, and who owns them::

    logical x:  0 ....................... T ....................... nx
                |<------ GPU 0 owns ----->|<------ GPU 1 owns ----->|

Each GPU's ARRAY is its interior grown by ``h`` on both sides.  Because the
domain is periodic there are TWO seams, not one -- the interior seam at ``T``
and the wrap seam at ``0``/``nx`` -- and each GPU's two halos BOTH come from
the other GPU, from opposite ends of its interior::

    GPU 0 array   [ left halo ][    interior [0,T)    ][ right halo ]
    covers        [ nx-h, nx )                          [ T, T+h )
                        ^                                    ^
                        |  wrap seam                         |  interior seam
                        |                                    |
    GPU 1 array   [ left halo ][   interior [T,nx)    ][ right halo ]
    covers        [ T-h, T )                            [ nx, nx+h ) = [0, h)
                                 ^                  ^
                                 |                  |
                    feeds GPU 0's right halo    feeds GPU 0's left halo

So GPU 0's LEFT halo is fed by the RIGHT end of GPU 1's interior, and GPU 0's
RIGHT halo by the LEFT end of GPU 1's interior.  Getting those two crossed is
the failure this module's ``verify_geometry`` exists to catch: it compares
every sub-domain array, cell for cell, against the window of a monolithic run,
so a crossed seam shows up as a mismatch confined to one halo band instead of
as a slightly wrong forecast.

The vertical is NEVER split.  Whether y is split is up to ``grid=(gy, gx)``:
with ``gy == 1`` a sub-domain has the parent's full ``ny``, so its own periodic
wrap in y IS the domain's and no y halo exists, and only ``nx`` differs between
the parent config and a sub-config.  ``grid=(n, 1)`` is the same picture rotated
a quarter turn -- the seam bands become whole rows instead of column strips and
the staggered variant at the seam is ``v`` (``ny+1`` rows) instead of ``u``
(``nx+1`` columns), which is a genuinely different set of strides and a
different alias slot, so the gate runs both.

``grid=(gy, gx)`` with BOTH above 1 adds corners: a sub-domain's corner block
(inside its x halo and its y halo at once) belongs to the DIAGONAL neighbour and
no single band reaches it.  Rather than a fifth band per corner, the exchange
runs in two rounds -- x seams over the sub-array's full height, then y seams
over its full width, which by then includes the x halo the first round made
exact.  The corner arrives in two hops.  ``seam_plan`` documents the ordering
and every exchange mode enforces it.


STAGGERING AT THE SEAM
----------------------
``u`` has ``nx+1`` faces and the last one is the periodic alias of face 0
(:mod:`tilestream.spec` calls it the alias slot).  A sub-domain of width
``W = T + 2h`` therefore carries ``W+1`` u slots, and the halo refresh must
cover ``h+1`` of them on the right (slots ``h+T .. W`` inclusive), not ``h``.
That extra slot is filled from LOGICAL face ``ci0 + W`` reduced mod ``nx``,
which is exactly what ``TileSpec.gather("u")`` puts there in the single-GPU
lane -- the scheme that is bit-exact.  ``v`` is staggered in y only, so at an
x seam it moves the same x-range as a mass field, over ``ny+1`` rows.

Reads never touch a source array's own alias slot: the source index is derived
from a logical index reduced mod ``nx`` and always lands inside the neighbour's
INTERIOR, which is the only part of the neighbour that is trustworthy after a
step.


WHAT IS REUSED, AND THE ONE THING THAT IS NOT
---------------------------------------------
The geometry is :class:`tilestream.spec.TileSpec`, built directly rather than
through ``plan_tiles`` because the split is x-only and a sub-domain must keep
the parent's full ``ny`` (``plan_tiles`` grows the halo on both axes).
``spec.validate_plan``, ``TileSpec.gather`` and ``TileSpec.scatter`` then apply
unchanged, and they are what loads the sub-domains and reassembles them.  The
config is ``harness.tile_config``; the buffer is ``driver.make_tile_state``;
the stagger classification is ``gather.classify``; the halo is
``harness.halo_radius``.

The SEAM transport is the exception.  ``gather.gather_tile`` moves a
full-domain array to a tile array and ``build_plan`` checks the two sides
against exactly that relationship -- a seam has a sub-domain on BOTH ends, so
that check rejects it before any bytes move.  And a halo band is
``nz*ny`` rows of ``halo*4 = 64`` bytes: issued as-is over a link that stages
through host, it is a latency test, not a transfer.  So the seam packs into
one contiguous staging buffer per band with device-local ``cudaMemcpy2DAsync``
(0.35-0.50 ms, measured), crosses in ONE ``cudaMemcpyPeerAsync``, and unpacks
the same way.


ORDERING: why the exchange cannot be moved
------------------------------------------
After a step, a sub-domain's interior is exact and its halo is garbage (it is
the sub-domain's own periodic wrap-around, not the neighbour).  The refresh
must therefore read the neighbour's interior AT THE SAME TIME LEVEL -- i.e.
after the neighbour has stepped too.  That is a barrier, and it is not
negotiable: the read-at-time-t rule from :mod:`tilestream.driver` applies here
verbatim.  What CAN overlap is pack/transfer/unpack against the other GPU's
remaining compute, and the two directions against each other; see
``exchange_mode="events"``.

There is no interior/halo split of the step itself, so "exchange while the
interiors compute" is NOT available without carving up ``dycore.step``.  This
module does not pretend otherwise.


MEASURED ON THIS BOX (2x RTX 4090, driver 580.95.05, CUDA 13.0, cupy 14.1.1).
Reproduce any line with ``python -m tilestream.multigpu <what>``.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
``gate`` is green for all four (step, exchange) pipelines and all three
transports; ``controls`` fires on all four deliberate defects -- at its own
step default, which is longer than the positive gates' and is not negotiable
downwards, see ``SHORT_HALO_VISIBLE_AT``; ``geometry`` shows every sub-domain
array, halo included, identical to the monolithic window.  Wall clock for a whole domain, two GPUs versus one -- median of 7,
``events``/``events`` (the ``threads`` pipeline is 1-3% quicker but its spread
reaches 8% at 768^2, so the steady one is quoted)::

    domain     1 GPU     2 GPU      vs 1 GPU   no-exchange   exposed exchange
    768^2    120.20 ms   74.38 ms    x1.616     x1.711        4.2 ms /  74 MiB

    1280^2   364.93 ms  187.75 ms    x1.944     x2.023        7.4 ms / 124 MiB

THREE effects, and they do not all point the same way.  Factored by measuring
one sub-domain ALONE on one card and comparing (``run_phase2.py attrib``)::

    domain   full 1-GPU   1 sub-domain alone   halo    concurrency  exchange
    768^2      120.18 ms       66.16 ms       1.0833x    1.0564x     1.1048x
    1024^2     218.92 ms      114.76 ms       1.0625x    1.0346x     1.0334x
    1280^2     363.59 ms      176.72 ms       1.0500x    1.0223x     1.0259x
    1536^2     548.97 ms      264.78 ms       1.0417x    1.0131x     1.0223x

* HALO RECOMPUTE, against: each GPU steps ``(T + 2h)/T`` cells it needs, and
  throws the overlap away.  Shrinks as the domain grows.
* CONCURRENCY LOSS, against: two cards busy at once cost more than one card
  alone by a FIXED ~3.8 ms per step (3.73 / 3.97 / 3.94 / 3.46 ms across the
  four sizes), not a fixed fraction.  That constant is the host side -- CPython
  serialises the two step-launch sequences whichever way they are driven --
  so it fades as the step gets longer, and it is why ``threads`` barely beats
  ``interleaved``.
* PER-CELL COST, FOR: the step costs more per cell on a bigger domain
  (4.16 ns/cell at 512^2, 4.26 at 1024^2, 4.75 at 1536^2), so halving the
  domain also moves both cards into a cheaper regime.  At 1280^2 one
  672x1280 sub-domain alone runs in 176.72 ms against 363.59 for the whole
  thing -- better than half, despite computing 5% more cells; at 1536^2 it is
  264.78 against 548.97, a 2.07x edge before concurrency is even involved.

Below ~1024^2 the first two win and the pair gives ~1.6-1.75x; by 1536^2 the
third has taken over and it reaches ~2.0x.  Do not extrapolate either end:
the crossover is a property of this card's cache and occupancy, not of the
decomposition.

The seam itself costs ~10 GB/s per direction, measured by ``exchange``
(74 MiB each way at 1536^2 in 7.75 ms) -- P2P is off, so CUDA stages through
host, and this is that path, not a hand-rolled one.


TRAPS CHECKED
-------------
* ``woof.core.kernels.load_module`` is ``@lru_cache``d on the source, so both
  devices share one ``RawModule`` object.  CuPy keeps a per-device module map
  inside ``RawModule``, and this was MEASURED: a state compiled on device 0 and
  stepped on device 1 gives a hash identical to device 0's.  No per-device
  cache key is needed.
* CuPy memory pools are per device.  Every allocation here happens inside an
  explicit ``cp.cuda.Device`` context, including the seam staging buffers.
* P2P is unavailable on GeForce 40-series (``canAccessPeer == 0``).
  ``cudaMemcpyPeerAsync`` still works -- CUDA stages through its own host
  buffer -- and that is the transport used.  Nothing here hand-rolls
  device->host->device.
* Every cross-device copy is fenced with events on both devices before any
  result is read.
