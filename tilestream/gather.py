"""Moving bytes between a full-domain store and a halo tile.

This is the transport layer of the out-of-core tiling prototype.  It owns two
operations and nothing else::

    gather_tile(store, tile_state, spec, stream=None)   # domain -> tile
    scatter_tile(tile_state, store, spec, stream=None)  # tile interior -> domain

``store`` holds the full domain's persisted inventory -- the names in
``woof.state_serialization_contract.STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS`` (47 as of the
mp9/P3 restart fixes; ``test_gather`` pins the exact count) -- as arrays that
may live in PINNED host RAM (the out-of-core case) or on the device (the
in-core gate).  ``tile_state`` is a ``DomainState`` built on the tile config.
``spec`` is a ``TileSpec`` from ``tilestream.spec`` (see "Spec contract").

Why cudaMemcpy3D and not slice assignment
-----------------------------------------
A gather writes an ``(nz, ty, tx)`` block into a tile array from an
``(nz, ny, nx)`` domain array.  Neither side is contiguous: rows are ``tx``
elements long with a source pitch of ``nx`` and a destination pitch of ``tx``,
and planes are strided again.  The options were:

* ``cupy`` slice assignment -- device-to-device only.  Cannot touch host RAM
  without CuPy staging a contiguous temporary, which allocates per call and
  puts a pageable buffer (15 GB/s) in the middle of a 57 GB/s path.
* one ``cudaMemcpy2DAsync`` per k-plane -- correct, but ``nz`` launches per
  field per segment.  At nz=49 and 9 live fields that is 441 launches for one
  tile whose payload only takes ~0.8 ms to move; launch overhead would be the
  same order as the transfer.
* ``cudaMemcpy3DAsync`` -- ONE call per (field, segment), handling row pitch,
  plane pitch and a 3-D source/destination offset natively.  ``cupy`` exposes
  it (``cupy.cuda.runtime.memcpy3DAsync``) but only as a raw pointer to a
  ``cudaMemcpy3DParms``, so the struct is declared here in ctypes.  The layout
  (sizeof 160, field offsets 0/8/32/64/72/96/128/152) is asserted at import
  and is exercised bitwise by ``test_gather.py``; a layout error cannot pass
  silently.

The same call serves all four directions (H2D, D2H, D2D, H2H), so gather and
scatter are one code path with the ``kind`` flipped, and an on-device store
(the bit-exact gate) and a pinned-host store (the real pipeline) differ only
in a pointer type.

Staggering is derived FROM SHAPE
--------------------------------
Nothing here hard-codes which field is which.  :func:`classify` compares an
array's trailing two axes against the domain's ``(ny, nx)`` and its leading
axis against ``nz``:

    (.., ny,   nx  ) and lead nz    -> 'mass'   (thp, p, al, qv, ... and 2-D mup)
    (.., ny,   nx+1)                -> 'u'
    (.., ny+1, nx  )                -> 'v'
    (nz+1, ny, nx  )                -> 'w'      (w, php)

so a field added to ``STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS`` tomorrow is handled the day it
appears, and a field whose shape does not match ANY stagger raises instead of
being copied wrong.  2-D ``(ny, nx)`` surface fields (``mup``, ``nwfa2d``,
``nifa2d``) fall out of the same rule with a depth of 1.

Spec contract
-------------
``tilestream.spec.TileSpec`` is written by another agent and owns ALL index
arithmetic; this module does no geometry of its own.  What is consumed is:
for each stagger kind in ``('mass', 'u', 'v', 'w')``, the rectangles to copy,
separately for gather and for scatter.  ``tilestream.spec`` spells that
``spec.gather(variant) -> tuple[Transfer, ...]``, where ``Transfer`` names its
two sides ``full``/``tile`` rather than src/dst -- better, because it says
which array each slice indexes instead of leaving it to the direction.
:func:`segments_for` also accepts mapping attributes and already-oriented
``(src_slices, dst_slices)`` pairs, so a second spec implementation with a
different spelling still works; the test file exercises both.

ONLY THE TRAILING TWO AXES of a spec slice tuple are used.  A tile always
takes the full vertical column, and the vertical extent differs per field
(``nz`` for mass, ``nz+1`` for w/phi, absent for 2-D surface fields), so a
single horizontal segment list has to serve all of them.  Any leading entries
in a spec tuple must be full slices (``slice(None)``) or ``Ellipsis`` and are
ignored; a partial vertical slice raises rather than being silently dropped.

Two structural checks run at plan time, independent of which spec is in use
(:func:`_check_destination_rects`): destination rectangles must be pairwise
DISJOINT, and a GATHER's must cover the tile array exactly.  The second is
the one that matters -- a tile array whose horizontal shape does not match
the plan leaves cells holding stale halo values, every rectangle is still in
bounds, and the run produces a plausible forecast instead of an error.

Ordering
--------
Nothing here synchronizes.  Copies are issued on the caller's stream and
return immediately.  A ``non_blocking=True`` stream does NOT synchronize with
the default stream, so anything that wrote the store or the tile buffers on
another stream must be fenced with an event (or a device sync) before the
gather.  This bit the test suite before it bit the pipeline: see
``test_gather._sync``.

Pinning
-------
Host arrays are REQUIRED to be pinned.  Pageable host memory measures 15 GB/s
against 57 GB/s pinned on this machine, and it is also not truly asynchronous,
so a pageable buffer would quietly destroy both the bandwidth and the
copy/compute overlap the whole design depends on.  Every host pointer is
checked with ``cudaPointerGetAttributes`` when a plan is built and
:class:`PageableHostMemoryError` is raised if it is not registered.  Use
:func:`pinned_empty` / :func:`make_host_store` to allocate.

Allocation
----------
No device or host memory is allocated per call.  A :class:`TilePlan` resolves
the spec, classifies every field, validates every extent and preallocates the
single ``cudaMemcpy3DParms`` struct it mutates in place; plans are cached on
the spec object keyed by a structural signature of the two inventories.  Call
:func:`make_plan` once and reuse the plan in a hot loop to skip even the
signature build.
