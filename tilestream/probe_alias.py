"""Does a RESIDENT open-boundary run keep the periodic alias slot an alias?

``tilestream.spec``'s module docstring states WOOF's convention: on a
periodic axis there are only ``ny`` independent v faces and slot ``ny`` is an
ALIAS of slot 0.  ``harness.make_state`` seeds it that way, the tiled scatter
maintains it that way, and every y stencil in the dycore wraps as if it were
true.

This probe asks the resident model whether it still is after one step, on a
domain that is open in x and periodic in y.  It is a MONOLITHIC measurement:
no tiling, no store, no gather.  If the answer is no, the tiled/monolithic
disagreement at the four corner tiles is a property of the DYCORE and not of
the transport, and no halo can fix it.
