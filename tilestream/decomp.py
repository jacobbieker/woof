"""Slice a GLOBAL domain state across ranks: gathered, never rebuilt.

The multi-GPU path builds every rank's state by calling an analytic builder at
the rank's LOCAL shape (``physics_inventory.default_builder`` on a WK82
sounding).  That is the right thing for a bit-exact transport gate -- the gate
never inspects a value -- and it is useless for a forecast, for two separate
reasons:

* the sounding is a function of ``z`` alone, so eight ranks build eight
  IDENTICAL tiles and the "domain" has no horizontal structure to advect;
* there is no analysis anywhere in it.

The missing operation is not a new initialiser.  It is the one the tiled path
already performs on GEOGRAPHY: take the DOMAIN-extent arrays, put them in a
host store, and hand each rank ITS WINDOW through
:class:`tilestream.spec.TileSpec` -- staggering, halo and periodic wrap all
handled by the code the data path already uses.

Rebuilding per rank is not a slower equivalent of slicing; it is a DIFFERENT
DOMAIN.  ``harness.make_geography`` centres its projection on whatever
``nx``/``ny`` it is handed, so a rank that rebuilds is somewhere else on the
earth -- up to 1,022 km away on an eight-way split of a CONUS domain.  The
same argument applies verbatim to the initial condition, which is why this
module exists.

What one rank needs, in full:

``carriers``
    every entry of :func:`tilestream.physics_inventory.carrier_inventory`
    with a horizontal extent -- the prognostic state, the tendency bundles,
    the surface and soil fields.  Sliced.
``geography``
    every entry of :func:`tilestream.driver.geography_inventory` -- the
    horizontally-varying INPUT: terrain, base state, map factors, Coriolis,
    and the per-scheme latitude/longitude grids that no carrier manifest
    mentions.  Sliced.
``scalars``
    the carrier scalars, ``elapsed_seconds`` first among them.  BROADCAST, not
    sliced.  Ranks that disagree about elapsed time disagree about which
    schemes are due on the next step.
``setup flags``
    ``has_msf`` and ``rotational``, computed ONCE over the domain arrays and
    re-imposed on every rank.  ``DomainState.set_map_coriolis`` derives them
    from ``.any()`` over whatever window it was handed, so a rank whose window
    happens to be uniform silently takes a different branch in the Coriolis
    kernel.
``vertical setup``
    ``znu``, ``znw``, ``dnw``, ``c1h..c4f``, ``fnp``, ``fnm`` and friends are
    pure functions of ``nz``/``hybrid_opt``/``etac``/``p_top``: a rank rebuilds
    them exactly.  NOT sliced -- and :func:`assert_slice_faithful` checks that
    claim rather than assuming it.

    Answered the only way that means anything: by comparing like with like.
    The mean absolute first difference is taken across the columns that ARE a
    rank boundary and across the columns that are NOT, and the statistic is
    their ratio.  A field with real weather in it has a large absolute
    gradient everywhere, so an absolute threshold on the seam difference is
    uninterpretable; the ratio is not.  A correct slice gives a ratio near 1,
    because a seam column is an ordinary column that happens to have a rank
    boundary drawn on it.

    Reported separately for x and y seams: a decomposition can be right in one
    axis and transposed in the other, and a combined number hides that.
