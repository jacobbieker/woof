"""The pinned full-domain host store: the authoritative out-of-core state.

This is the module that makes a larger-than-VRAM domain possible.  The
persistent state -- exactly the ``STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS`` inventory that
:mod:`tilestream.harness` hashes -- lives here, in PINNED host RAM, at FULL
domain shape.  Only halo tiles ever visit the GPU.

Three things in here are essential and worth reading before you use it.

1.  THE MANIFEST IS PROBED, NOT HARDCODED.  Which of the contract
    attributes (47 as of the mp9/P3 restart fixes; ``test_gather`` pins the
    count) actually exist, and their staggering, depend on the config
    (``moist``, ``mp_physics``, ``km_opt``, ``bl_pbl_physics``).  Rather than
    transcribe ``woof/core/state.py``'s allocation branches -- which would
    silently drift -- :func:`build_manifest` constructs a throwaway
    ``DomainState(cfg', array_module=numpy)`` at a tiny probe shape whose six
    possible extents are pairwise distinct, and reads the staggering off the
    real shapes.  The probe costs no GPU memory and no CUDA context.

2.  PINNING IS ASSERTED, NOT ASSUMED.  Every buffer's device pointer
    attributes are checked (``cudaPointerGetAttributes(...).type == 1``,
    ``cudaMemoryTypeHost``); a pageable pointer reports ``0``.  That is a
    hard programmatic gate, and :meth:`HostDomainStore.measure_h2d_bandwidth`
    is the independent empirical one -- pinned should reach ~50-57 GB/s on
    this box, pageable ~15 GB/s.

3.  THE HASH IS BYTE-IDENTICAL TO THE HARNESS'S.  :meth:`HostDomainStore.hash`
    reuses ``harness._digest_payload`` and walks ``STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS`` in
    the same order, so ``store.hash() == harness.hash_state(state)`` is a
    direct comparison and is the correctness gate for the whole round trip.

4.  ALLOCATION BYPASSES CUPY'S PINNED POOL.  ``cupy.cuda.alloc_pinned_memory``
    rounds every request UP TO THE NEXT POWER OF TWO -- measured, see
    :func:`pool_rounded_bytes` -- so a field one byte past 2 GiB consumed
    4 GiB.  That, and nothing about the driver, produced the "2 GiB block
    cliff" this store was previously believed to have.  :class:`PinnedBlock`
    calls ``cudaHostAlloc`` directly for the EXACT byte count.  See
    :func:`probe_pinned_ceiling`.

Everything is float32 -- verified against the probe, not assumed; the store
carries whatever dtype the probe reports and would allocate a non-float32
field correctly if one ever appeared.

    :class:`PinnedBlock` does not go through the pool, so for this store the

       a memory cgroup limit it is the smallest limit, the fraction the
       planner's ``Machine.host_budget_bytes`` takes of the same figure.

    Deliberately still a prediction and not a probe: probing allocates tens
    of GiB and frees them, which is not something a store build should do on
    a shared box on the way to its real allocation.  The prediction is a
    gate, and :class:`PinnedAllocationFailed` remains the backstop for a wall

    Three independent gates, all of which must pass:

    * the caller's explicit ``budget_bytes`` cap,
    * ``MemAvailable - reserve_bytes`` (do not drive the box into swap),
    * ``max_total_fraction * MemTotal`` (never pin most of the machine).

    Both machine figures are :func:`host_memory`'s, so under a memory cgroup
    limit they are the limit's room and the limit, not the whole host's.
    ``reserve_bytes`` None is :func:`host_reserve_bytes` of that total, so
    the reserve shrinks with a small machine or limit instead of taking a
    fixed 8 GiB out of it.  A refusal names the cgroup limit only when the
    limit, or the room under it, is what set the figure it quotes.

    The third gate is the one that matters most and the one that is easiest
    to get wrong.  ``MemAvailable`` is NOT an upper bound on pinnable memory:
    page-locking walls at MemTotal/2 -- 46.94 GiB on this 93.91 GiB box --
    while /proc/meminfo still shows 92 GiB free.  See
    :data:`PINNED_CEILING_FRACTION` and :data:`DEFAULT_MAX_TOTAL_FRACTION`.
    Requests that clear all three gates can still hit that wall (another
    process may hold page-locked memory of its own, and the ceiling is
    system-wide), in which case :class:`PinnedAllocationFailed` is raised with
    the partial total; that is a backstop, not the plan.

    This is deliberately a REFUSAL, not a warning.  Pinning tens of GB that
    the kernel cannot reclaim is the failure mode that takes the box down,
    and it is not worth a "best effort" attempt.

    One pinned buffer per persisted attribute, at full domain shape and
    correct WRF-ARW staggering.  ``.arrays`` exposes them as ordinary
    C-contiguous NumPy views, so a tile gather is plain NumPy slicing --
    but the memory underneath is page-locked, which is the whole point:

        A ``RunConfig`` (or any dataclass config carrying ``nz/ny/nx`` and the
        physics selectors).  Its ``nz/ny/nx`` set the store's shape; a shrunk
        copy is used to probe the inventory.
    attrs:
        Contract names to consider, in hash order.  Defaults to the enforced
        ``STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS``.
    budget_bytes:
        Hard cap on the store's total size.  ``None`` means only the machine
        gates apply.
    manifest:
        Skip probing and use this inventory (for non-dataclass configs).
