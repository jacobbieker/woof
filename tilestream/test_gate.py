"""THE BIT-EXACT GATE: a tiled run must equal a monolithic run, exactly.

Run it::

    python -m tilestream.test_gate            # from the repository root

Everything else in this prototype is performance work.  This file is the only
thing that says the performance work is worth anything, because a streaming
bug that skips or reorders work looks exactly like a speedup and only an
exact comparison can tell the two apart.

What is compared
----------------
A seeded, fully periodic domain is stepped ``N`` times two ways -- once as one
array, once as tiles gathered with a halo, stepped independently and scattered
back -- and the SHA-256 over the whole persisted inventory must be identical.
Not close: identical.  ``harness.hash_state`` folds each array's name, dtype,
shape and raw bytes into one digest, so a shape change cannot masquerade as a
value change.

Periodic is deliberate.  With ``open_x=open_y=specified=nested=False`` every
tile is an interior tile, the halo gather is a wraparound slice, and there is
no lateral-boundary special case anywhere -- which removes the entire BC
question from the milestone and leaves exactly one thing under test: whether a
16-cell halo makes a tile's interior exact.

The negative controls matter as much as the positives
-----------------------------------------------------
A gate that has only ever passed proves nothing.  Four configurations are
asserted to FAIL, and each one fails for a different reason:

* ``halo=8`` and ``halo=11`` -- too narrow.  11 is one cell below the measured
  minimum and fails by ~1e-5 on ``php``/``w`` only, which is what a
  marginally-short halo looks like as distinct from a broken one.
* ``write_mode="inplace"`` -- the read-at-time-t bug: tiles read the buffer
  their predecessors have already written, so a tile's halo sees its
  neighbours at ``t + dt``.  This is the single most likely way to write a
  wrong tiling, it produces a perfectly plausible-looking forecast, and this
  is the row that proves the gate would catch it.
* ``halo`` above the measured minimum is NOT slack to be reclaimed.  The
  sweep reports the smallest width that passes at each step count, and the
  answer moves: 12 at N=1, 13 at N=3, 14 at N=8.  See :func:`halo_vs_steps`
  -- a one-step gate certifies halo 12, and halo 12 is wrong by 0.2 after two
  steps.  The halo comes from ``harness.halo_radius(cfg)``, and the
  measurement's job is to confirm that value, not to shrink it.

Milestone two: the same gate with FULL PHYSICS
----------------------------------------------
A dry bit-exact gate proves the MECHANISM.  Only a full-physics gate proves
the product, and the physics section (``--physics-only`` runs just it,
``--dry-only`` just the original) is the one that does.  It streams the whole
restart manifest -- 138 to 229 arrays, ``state/*`` plus ``scratch/*`` plus
``driver/*`` plus ``fields/*`` plus ``cumulus/w0avg`` -- across fourteen
rungs from dry to full physics + MYNN + Noah-MP, at 2x1 / 2x2 / 3x3-ragged /
1x1 geometry, N = 1 / 3 / 8, VRAM store and pinned host store.

Its negative controls are what make it mean anything, and each names a
distinct way this milestone could have been faked:

* streaming ``state/*`` only -- which is EXACTLY milestone one's inventory,
  run at a physics rung.  127 of 229 carriers differ.  That failure is the
  reason this milestone exists.
* not carrying the scalar clock at a fast cadence -- 46 of 153 differ.  Note
  the same control at ``radt=12 min, cudt=5 min`` PASSES: 8 steps of 3 s
  never reach a cadence boundary, so a long-cadence short run cannot see a
  clock bug at all.
* ``write_mode="inplace"`` -- the read-at-time-t bug, 89 of 155 differ.
* ``halo=13`` at 256x192 with 4x4 tiles -- 111 of 229 differ.  It has to be
  run at that size: at the 96x80 gate size a 48x40 tile with halo 16 already
  gathers 83% by 90% of the domain, and halo 13 PASSES there.  The cheap
  test certifies the wrong halo; that is FACT 1 again.
* a horizontally varying radiation latitude grid -- refused by
  ``physics_inventory.assert_tileable_geography``, because in THAT section a
  tile still rebuilds its geography and the tile centred on the domain is the
  one that agrees.  The geography section below removes the restriction
  rather than living with it.

Milestone three: the same gate with a REAL MAP PROJECTION
---------------------------------------------------------
``--geography-only`` runs it.  A real Lambert conformal grid at
``configs/real74_d01.toml``'s own dx=dy=12 km, a lat/lon-anchored terrain and
per-column latitude/longitude on every scheme -- so ``has_msf`` and
``rotational`` are both TRUE, the Coriolis+curvature kernel and the
msf-weighted paths are live, ``thb/pb/alb/phb`` are 3-D and terrain-following,
and the solar-zenith path reads a latitude that varies.  The 17 geography
arrays are GATHERED per tile, exactly like a carrier, but ONCE per buffer
occupancy rather than per step, and never scattered.

Its negative controls, each naming a different way this could have been faked:

* geography REBUILT from ``tile_cfg`` -- today's behaviour.  114 of 229
  carriers differ.  The rebuilt tile is displaced by
  ``ci0 + (cnx+1)/2 - (nx+1)/2`` cells per axis, MEASURED up to 12.41 deg of
  latitude and 2069 km at 192x160 split 3x3.
* ``has_msf``/``rotational`` derived from the TILE's window instead of the
  domain's -- 32 of 229 differ, with the geography arrays themselves correct.
* the setup arrays gathered but the SCHEME lat/lon grids rebuilt, at the fast
  cadence where radiation fires every step -- 47 of 153 differ.  Those four
  arrays are neither on the state nor in the carrier manifest, so nothing
  else in this pipeline would move them.
* the scheme lat/lon gathered but the setup arrays rebuilt -- 48 of 153.
* ``periodic_faces=False``: a periodic domain whose ``msfv[ny,:]`` does not
  duplicate ``msfv[0,:]`` -- 54 of 229 differ.
* ``halo=7`` at 256x192 with 4x4 tiles.  NOTE the number: at dx=12 km the
  smallest bit-exact halo is 8, where the identical geometry at dx=500 m
  needs 14.  A coarse grid is a WEAKER halo test.

Diagnosis, not just a verdict
-----------------------------
A failing row is analysed rather than reported: per-field digests localise
which field broke first, and :func:`spatial_signature` classifies the pattern
of differing cells -- clustered within ``halo`` of a tile seam (a halo width
problem), spread uniformly (a global reduction or a changed reduction order),
or confined to one tile (ragged-edge handling).  The max relative difference
separates the two failure families that need completely different fixes: ~1e-7
relative is floating-point reassociation, while ~1e-1 is a wrong stencil.

    3.8e-06 at five, 0.49 at eight, saturated at 0.73 by twelve.  That is a
    truncated stencil seeding a perturbation below the float32 rounding
    threshold and the nonlinear dynamics amplifying it.  A gate that only ever
    ran one step would have certified halo 12 -- the value two independent
    earlier probes reported as "the true minimum, so 16 is conservative by 4
    cells" -- and the resulting forecast would be visibly wrong within a
    minute of model time while every one-step test kept passing.  This is the
    most dangerous failure mode the project has: it is silent, it is faster,
    and a short test certifies it.

    So the halo is set from the derivation, not from a measurement:
    ``harness.halo_radius(cfg) = 10 + 3*ns//2``, which is 16 at
    ``time_step_sound=4``.  The measurement's only job is to confirm the
    derived value is sufficient, which it does at every step count tried
    (24 steps, 216 tile-steps, bit-exact).  Note even 14 survives N=24 here --
    which is exactly why an empirical minimum must not be trusted: there is no
    step count at which "it has not failed yet" becomes "it cannot fail".

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PHYSICS: the same gate, with the whole carrier set streamed
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Milestone one proved the MECHANISM on nine dry arrays.  This proves the
# PRODUCT: the same tiled loop, streaming the entire restart manifest -- 138
# to 229 arrays including the mp/cu precipitation accumulators, the held
# radiation and PBL tendencies, the 88-to-162 surface/soil/snow fields and
# Kain-Fritsch's lazily-allocated w0avg trigger memory -- plus the scalar
# carriers that decide every physics cadence.
#
# Three things had to change and each is a separate way this could have been
# quietly wrong:
#
#   1. the inventory.  gather.inventory reaches STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS by
#      getattr and cannot see state._scratch or state.physics AT ALL, so a
#      physics run streaming it drops 1.79x more carried bytes than it keeps.
#   2. the tile buffer.  harness.make_state attaches no PhysicsDriver, so
#      dycore.step raised at every rung above dry; and two carriers are
#      allocated lazily on first use, so the buffer must have stepped once
#      before its inventory matches the store's.
#   3. the clock.  dycore.step advances elapsed_seconds per CALL, and every
#      due test is a function of it, so a buffer serving k tiles would run
#      k*dt ahead of the domain inside one sweep and tiles would disagree
#      about which schemes are due.

# removes that restriction: a real Lambert conformal grid at
# configs/real74_d01.toml's own dx=dy=12 km, a lat/lon-anchored terrain, and
# per-column latitude/longitude handed to every scheme -- so has_msf and
# rotational are BOTH TRUE, the Coriolis+curvature kernel and every
# msf-weighted path are live, thb/pb/alb/phb are 3-D and terrain-following,
# and the solar-zenith path reads a latitude that actually varies.
#
# The geography is GATHERED, not rebuilt.  17 arrays at the Noah-MP rung --
# 13 STATE_SETUP_ARRAYS with a horizontal extent plus the four scheme lat/lon
# grids, which are NOT on the state and NOT in the carrier manifest, so
# nothing else in this pipeline would move them.
#
# WHY A ONE-TILE TEST WOULD CERTIFY THE BUG, which is why this section is
# built around asymmetry: projection.py:122-123 defaults the reference point
# to the domain centre, so the tile centred on the domain is BIT-EXACT while
# every other one is displaced by ci0 + (cnx+1)/2 - (nx+1)/2 cells per axis.
#
# READ THIS BEFORE USING THIS SECTION TO CERTIFY ANYTHING ELSE.  dx here is
# 12 km, not the 500 m of the sections above, and MEASURED that makes it a
# much WEAKER halo test: at 256x192 with 4x4 tiles of 64x48 and N=8 the
# smallest bit-exact halo is 8, where the same geometry at dx=500 m needs 14.
# The per-cell gradients are 24x smaller, so a truncated halo falls below a
# float32 ULP.  The halo control here is therefore halo=7, and the halo
# itself still comes from harness.halo_radius(cfg) = 16.

# main
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# milestone four: the same gate with the step REPLAYED FROM A CUDA GRAPH
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ``--graph-only`` runs it.  A tiled sweep re-issues the step's ~1,200 kernel
# launches once per TILE, so the launch overhead -- 26% of the step's wall in
# ArWen's own profile -- is multiplied by the tile count and is worst on the
# small compute windows a small card is forced into.  Capturing a tile's step
# once and replaying it for the other tiles removes that multiplication.
#
# It also introduces four new ways to be silently wrong, and this section
# exists because the first three of them produce a perfectly plausible
# forecast:
#
#   * the graph is captured EMPTY (capture without making the stream current)
#     and every replay does nothing.  Caught by graphcap's node-count floor,
#     not here, because an empty step does not merely differ -- it does not
#     move at all, which the digest would also show.
#   * the graph is replayed under a DIFFERENT cadence than it was captured
#     under, so radiation or cumulus silently runs when it should not, or
#     does not when it should.  ``graph_key="none"`` is that failure on
#     purpose and it MUST be caught.
#   * the replay skips the step's HOST bookkeeping, so the buffer's clock and
#     call counters stop advancing.  ``graph_scalars=False`` is that failure
#     on purpose.
#   * two buffers replay concurrently into the same captured scratch
#     addresses.  That one is prevented structurally -- one private memory
#     pool per buffer -- and every physics case below runs ``nbuffers=2``,
#     which is what puts two graphs on two streams at the same time.
#
# The positives are deliberately the SAME cases the earlier sections run, with
# one keyword added.  A graph that changes any answer changes a digest that
# already has a reference.
#
# THIS SECTION IS CARD-DEPENDENT AND SAYS SO.  Every capture grows a private
# memory pool inside an active capture, so whether the section runs is a fact
# about the card and its driver, not only about capacity.  Measured, both
# idle and both 16 GB: an RTX 4080 runs the whole gate 233 checks passed / 0
# failed, and an RTX 5080 (sm_120, CUDA 13.1, cupy 14.1.1) refuses capture
# allocations with 15.2 GiB free, one or two of the three negative controls
# per run.  A row the card would not serve reports as MACHINE-LIMITED: not a
# pass, not a fail, counted separately, and named in the verdict as a
# coverage hole.  See :func:`capture_would_not_fit` for why neither other
# outcome is accurate.

    """The reason string when THIS CARD could not hold the capture, else None.

    A graph capture grows a private memory pool inside an ACTIVE capture,
    and whether the card will serve an allocation there is a property of
    the card and its driver rather than of this code: the same section that
    runs 233/0 on an idle 16 GB RTX 4080 has been measured refusing capture
    allocations on an idle 16 GB RTX 5080 with 15.2 GiB free, at 1.1 MB in
    one run and 201.6 MB in another.  Bulk capacity is not what ran out.
    Those are two different facts and the gate has to be able to say which
    one it hit.

    An out of memory is NOT a control firing and it is NOT a control failing:
    nothing was proved and nothing was disproved, so counting it either way
    is a lie in one direction or the other.  Counting it as a PASS is the
    green-on-nothing failure this lane exists to close; counting it as a FAIL
    tells an operator on a smaller card that the transport is broken when
    what is actually true is that their card cannot run this section.  It is
    reported as its own third outcome, named in the verdict as a coverage
    hole, and never silently.

    The whole cause chain is walked because ``graphcap`` wraps a capture
    failure under ``use_graph="require"``: the cupy ``OutOfMemoryError``
    arrives as the ``__cause__`` of a ``GraphCaptureError`` whose own type
    name says nothing about memory.
