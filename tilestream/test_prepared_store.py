"""The row-slab geometry of :mod:`woof.ingest.prepared_store`, on the CPU.

Run it::

    python -m pytest tilestream/test_prepared_store.py

``store_from_prepared_cache`` reads a prepared cache one ROW SLAB at a time
so that no full-domain ``DomainState`` is ever allocated on the card.  Five
private helpers carry the whole of that geometry, and all five are pure
Python over NumPy shapes:

``_plan_slabs``
    which rows each slab owns.
``_row_window``
    which rows of a given array belong to a slab -- ``rows`` for a mass
    field, ``rows + 1`` for a y-staggered one, because the closing face at a
    slab's last row IS the next slab's first.
``_window_mapping``
    the same rule over a static/surface/met dict.
``_slab_base``
    the same rule over the ``BaseState``'s array fields, which under
    terrain are domain-shaped and were the one input this file used to
    watch a slab be handed WHOLE.
``_scatter_rows``
    the window written back into its place in the full-domain store, with
    the row span read off the source's own second-to-last extent.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM THE PARITY GATE.  The loader's headline
claim -- that the slabbed road and the resident road produce bit-identical
frames -- needs a GPU, a cache on disk and a domain small enough for both.
The claim underneath it does not: **window-then-scatter must be the
identity**, for every field shape the store holds and every slab height the
plan produces, including the duplicated overlap row on staggered fields.
If that is false, no amount of parity testing on one domain size will say
which slab height broke it, and every failure mode here is SMOOTH -- a slab
written one row off, a closing face nobody owns, a y/x transposition -- so
the comparison is ``np.array_equal`` and the destination is poisoned with
NaN first.  ``tilestream.test_realdata``'s module docstring argues that at
length; this file is its CPU-only, GPU-free half.

WHAT IS NOT COVERED HERE, deliberately: everything that needs a device.
``_slab_state``, ``_boundaries_from_cache`` and ``store_from_prepared_cache``
itself build CuPy arrays and call into physics.  The only device contact this
file has is ``_scatter_rows``' ``import cupy`` (it asks CuPy two questions:
is this a device array, and if so hand me the host copy), which is answered
by a deliberately narrow stub -- see :class:`_StubCupy`.
