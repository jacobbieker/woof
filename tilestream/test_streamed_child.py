"""RESIDENT PARENT + TILE-STREAMED CHILD through the executor, both ways.

    python -m tilestream.test_streamed_child --steps 6   # shorter window

THE ROLES-FLIPPED TWIN OF ``tilestream/test_nest_executor.py``
--------------------------------------------------------------
That gate streams the PARENT and keeps the child resident; this one keeps
the parent resident and streams the CHILD -- the other concurrent-nesting
shape of the 2.3 train, the one whose user story is a large fine child
that does not fit beside its resident parent.  Same product loop
(``woof.core.model.execute_experiment``, its FORCE/FEEDBACK edge
dispatch and clock imposition), same static two-domain tree, and the
child's streaming goes through the PRODUCTION builder
(``streaming.prepared_domain_builder`` -> the nest tile hook), not a
harness re-implementation.

The legs:

``A  resident   fb0``   the control.
``B  resident   fb1``   MUST differ from A in the parent (the treatment
                        proof: arms that agree prove the experiment never
                        ran).
``C  child-streamed fb0``  d01 (state) and d02 (store) bit-identical to A.
``D  child-streamed fb1``  bit-identical to B, both domains.  Two-way
                        feedback restricting OUT OF the child's store into
                        the resident parent.
``E  resident solo``    parent alone, no child, same executor and cadence.
                        E's d01 vs C's d01 is the #43 mirror: a one-way
                        parent is bitwise unchanged by its streamed child.
``N1 stale child store``  C with the store UNPUBLISHED from the child
                        state and the coupler's bounded child operands
                        served off the frozen attach-time child
                        (:func:`stale_child_reads`): FORCE and the
                        feedback read then see the attach-time child.  d02
                        MUST differ from A (the instrument sees the
                        defect) and d01 MUST NOT move (one-way staleness
                        cannot reach a resident parent).
``N1b stale store, fb1``  the two-way twin: d01 MUST differ from B (the
                        feedback restricted attach-time air).
``N2 stale tile tables``  the launch-time generation reload disarmed
                        after the first FORCE: buffers keep serving
                        FORCE-1 tables while the generation claims
                        currency.  d02 MUST differ from A, d01 MUST equal
                        C's -- the reload is essential, in both
                        directions, before any PASS above is believed.
``W  starved frame``    the frame pull narrowed below the boundary zone
                        (``child_frame_windows`` and the bounded child
                        operands both fresh only 2 cells deep, < bdy
                        width 5): stale child cells inside the zone
                        ``bdy_interp1`` reads.  d02 MUST differ, d01 MUST
                        equal C's -- the window is really narrowing the
                        read.

Same discipline as the sibling gates: exit code 3 means the CARD WAS
TAKEN, cadence census printed for BOTH sides of every comparison, digests
over the STORE for a streamed domain and over the state for a resident
one.  The fb1 initial restriction runs BEFORE the child is attached to
the streaming transport -- the same order the product takes
(``build_experiment`` runs it at tree assembly; ``steppers_for_tree``
attaches after).

At this gate geometry (72^2 child) the boundary frame is most of the
child, so the corridor's traffic RATIO is modest; the ratio grows with
the child (~16x at the flagship shape, formula in the design doc).  This
gate is about bytes and bits, not budgets -- the same posture as the
inverse gate's 550sq-class shape.

    below the boundary zone the tables are built from, so it MUST move the

    mis-force the child (stale tables, starved frame): feeding a child
    inconsistent boundary tendencies can push a boundary-zone moisture
    a few 1e-6 negative within a dozen steps, and the full-state health
    gate then kills the leg -- which is the gate doing its job on a leg

    DIGESTS; run 1 measured exactly this (qv(46,70,66) = -2.54e-06 on
    the stale-tables leg, evidence/streamed-child/).

    ``store`` reaches ``stream_child``: ``"device"`` makes the store the
    state's own arrays, isolating the TILING arithmetic from the host
    TRANSPORT -- the same discriminator test_moving_nest carries.

    ``dump`` names a directory that receives this leg's FULL result --
    per-field digests included -- as JSON before any comparison runs, so
    a later leg's death cannot take the earlier legs' evidence with it.
