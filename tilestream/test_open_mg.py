"""OPEN LATERAL BOUNDARIES on N GPUs: the multi-GPU arm of the same question.

:mod:`tilestream.mgstream` shares one pinned host domain's tiles out over
several GPUs.  It was written on its own lane and gated PERIODIC only, and it
reaches the same two places this lane found wrong:

* ``_spec.plan_tiles(dx, dy, tile_nx, tile_ny, halo, periodic)`` -- one
  boolean for two axes, the exact defect that corrupts the y-boundary tile
  rows of an ``open_x``-only domain;
* ``_harness.tile_config(cfg, cnx, cny)`` -- one tile cfg for every buffer,
  carrying ``open_x``/``open_y`` to all four window edges.

The module here is ``mgstream.py`` verbatim from the ``tilestream-mgstream``
branch with ONE change: ``periodic_x`` / ``periodic_y`` threaded into
``plan_tiles``.  ``periodic=`` still sets both, so that lane's own gate is
unaffected.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT COVERED.  ``run_mgstream`` hard-binds
``_driver.make_tile_state`` as its buffer factory (mgstream.py:268), which
builds a dry ``DomainState`` and attaches no ``PhysicsDriver``, so the
multi-GPU path cannot run a physics rung at all -- with or without open
boundaries.  This gate therefore runs DRY only, and says so rather than
implying physics coverage it does not have.  That is not a limitation of open
boundaries: the two defects are geometric, they are visible in nine dry
carriers after one step, and the single-GPU matrix covers the physics rungs.

Three device lists, and the split is what makes a failure interpretable:

``(0,)``      one worker, one GPU -- must equal ``driver.run_tiled``
``(0, 0)``    two workers, ONE GPU -- separates "the partition is wrong"
              from "two physical GPUs interfere"
``(0, 1)``    two workers, two GPUs -- the real thing

    python -m tilestream.test_open_mg              # every arm it can run
    python -m tilestream.test_open_mg --devices=0  # single-GPU rows only
