"""The overlap event chain, proven and BROKEN without a card.

WHAT THIS GATES, AND WHY A GPU GATE CANNOT.  The overlap build moves the
ring sweep's copies onto dedicated streams; what keeps it a forecast is the
event chain :mod:`tilestream.overlap` derives from the ring plan.  The
consolidated GPU gate (``tilestream.test_gate``) proves the DEFAULT chain
bit-exact against a monolithic run -- but it cannot prove the chain is
ESSENTIAL, because whether an unordered pair of stream operations
actually races is a property of the card and of what else it is running.
The lane already owns the measurement that makes this concrete:
``ring_ordering="submission"`` was bit-exact on an idle card and wrong by
3.7e+02 under contention, hours apart, same code.  A revert-check that
depends on an idle card's scheduler is not a revert-check.

So the adversary here is not a card, it is a SCHEDULER THIS TEST CONTROLS.
The sweep is simulated: every gather / save / patch / step / scatter is a
task on its buffer's copy-in, compute or copy-out stream, ordered by
exactly the dependencies the driver would issue -- same-stream program
order, the structural per-tile edges, and the four plan-shaped wait lists
of :class:`tilestream.overlap.OverlapSchedule`, with CUDA's
wait-takes-the-last-recorded-snapshot semantics reproduced.  The store, the
windows and the ring arena are numpy arrays; the step is a radius-1 stencil
whose halo requirement the plans here satisfy.  An adversarial executor
then runs the tasks in every order the dependencies admit that its
strategies can reach -- issue order, reversed preference, gathers-first,
scatters-first, patches-first, saves-first-patches-last, and seeded random
priorities -- and the result must equal the monolithic reference EXACTLY,
for every strategy, at every plan and buffer count tried, including a
ragged one.

THE REVERT-CHECK, which is the point.  Each wait class is then removed, one
at a time, and the test demands "the digest moves or a control fires" --
resolved per class, because building this gate MEASURED which classes are
which and the answer was not the naive one:

* ``patch_waits`` cut: the CONTROL fires
  (:func:`tilestream.overlap.assert_schedule_covers_hazards` refuses, which
  is what the driver runs at construction under ``overlap="on"``) AND the
  DIGEST MOVES under an adversary.
* ``gather_seam_waits`` cut: control fires AND digest moves -- on a 2x2
  plan at two buffers, where a whole tile's scatter can be starved past
  the next sweep's gathers without blocking them transitively.
* ``scatter_waits`` and ``save_seam_waits`` cut: the control fires, and
  the digest CANNOT move on any plan whose read/write overlap relation is
  symmetric -- this gate PROVES the implication instead of hunting for a
  divergence it showed cannot exist.  A stencil plan reads a window and
  writes an interior, so "j reads what k writes" and "k reads what j
  writes" hold together; that makes ``war_deps`` a subset of
  ``patch_deps``, and the missing scatter-after-gather edge is then
  implied through save -> patch -> step -> scatter, and the missing
  save-after-patch seam edge through gather_seam -> stepped -> ready.
  The two lists are kept in the driver as belt and braces: the checker --
  which fires on their removal, and runs at every construction -- is what
  guards the asymmetric plan on which the implication would not hold.
* the structural cut -- every cross-stream event dropped, the driver's
  ``overlap="unchained"`` -- is invisible to the checker by design, so for
  it the digest alone is the verdict, and it must move.

A contract test then ties the simulation to the driver: the wait loops in
``tilestream/driver.py`` are read out with ``ast`` and each schedule list
must be paired with the event class this module simulated it against --
``patch_waits`` with the save events, ``scatter_waits`` with the gather
events, ``gather_seam_waits`` with the scatter events, ``save_seam_waits``
with the ready events.  The two sides are checked against each other, not
against a restatement of either -- the discipline
``tilestream/test_tile_hook_contract.py`` established, and for the same
reason.

Run with ``pytest tilestream/test_overlap.py`` or directly with
``python -m tilestream.test_overlap`` from the repository root.  numpy
only; no card, no cupy.

    Building this gate MEASURED that no adversary moves the digest when

    the adversary: a stencil plan's read/write overlap relation is
    symmetric, so ``war_deps[k]`` is a subset of ``patch_deps[k]`` and the
    scatter-after-gather edge is implied through
    save -> patch -> step -> scatter; likewise ``save_seam_waits[j]`` is a
    subset of the readers named in ``gather_seam_waits`` and the

    gather_seam -> stepped -> ready.  This test asserts BOTH inclusions on
    every plan tried, so the day a plan breaks the symmetry the implication
    visibly fails here -- and the driver still carries the explicit waits,
    with :func:`tilestream.overlap.assert_schedule_covers_hazards` (which
