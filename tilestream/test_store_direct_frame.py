"""A frame and a final digest for a domain that was never resident -- CPU only.

Run with ``pytest tilestream/test_store_direct_frame.py`` or directly with
``python tilestream/test_store_direct_frame.py``.  No GPU: everything here is
numpy, dicts and hashlib, which is the point -- the two seams under test are
exactly the two places a store-direct forecast used to need a domain-shaped
``DomainState`` it cannot have.

WHAT THE SLAB CAN AND CANNOT ANSWER
-----------------------------------
``woof.ingest.prepared_store`` fills the store one ROW SLAB at a time and
keeps the last slab as a template, so the tallest state a store-direct run
ever builds is ``rows`` deep.  ``tilestream.output.frame_plan`` measured
against that slab gets the CLASSIFICATION right (which scheme published which
field, and whether it is a carrier, a setup array, a host derive or an
output-only diagnostic -- none of which varies with height) and the SHAPES
wrong (it records ``np.shape`` of the arrays it matched, and those are the
slab's).  :func:`negative_slab_plan_is_not_a_domain_plan` is that failure,
measured: the frame constructs without complaint and then dies on the first
derive, and its structural-zero rows would have gone to disk as ``(rows, nx)``
planes.

:func:`tilestream.output.domain_frame_plan` is the fix and
:func:`test_domain_frame_plan_reproduces_the_domains_own_plan` is the gate on
it: the plan re-sized off a slab must equal, field for field, the plan a
domain-shaped state would have produced, and the two frames built from them
must be byte-identical.  That is the CPU half of the real-data parity gate,
which compares whole wrfout files for a domain small enough to run both ways.

AND THE DIGEST
--------------
``woof.state_digest.canonical_state_digest`` walks a resident state.  Pointed
at the state a streamed run holds it does not fail -- it returns a complete,
self-consistent digest OF THE ANALYSIS, because that state stopped moving when
the store was filled.  ``canonical_store_digest`` is the same document taken
off the store, and :func:`test_store_digest_equals_the_resident_digest` is the
equality: same sha256, same inventory sha256, same field order, over a
manifest assembled two different ways from the same arrays.
