"""NESTING ACROSS A STREAMED PARENT: does FORCE read the domain, or a ghost?

``woof.core.nest.NestCoupler`` couples a FULL parent prognostic field, couples
the FULL child field, runs ``bdy_interp1`` over both, and hangs the resulting
rolling tables on the child.  Every read is off ``node.state`` --
``nest.py:229`` (``parent_state = self.child_node.parent.state``),
``nest.py:309`` and ``nest.py:438``.

For a RESIDENT domain ``node.state`` IS the domain, so that is correct.  For a
STREAMED domain it is not: :func:`woof.core.streaming.attach` copies the
carriers into a store and every subsequent sweep updates THE STORE.  The
``DomainState`` object the model still holds is frozen at the instant of
attach.  Nothing raises, nothing warns and nothing goes non-finite -- the child
is simply forced from the parent's t=0 air for the whole forecast, which looks
exactly like a nest that is running.

This module measures that, in the three positions the feature occupies:

    python -m tilestream.test_nest              # d01 512^2, d02 256^2
    python -m tilestream.test_nest --medium     # d01 320^2, for a 24 GB card
    python -m tilestream.test_nest --quick      # d01 192^2, same legs, 6 steps
    python -m tilestream.test_nest --arena      # the VRAM number only

Exit code 3 means the CARD WAS TAKEN, not that anything failed.  These boxes
are shared and an allocation that loses a race is not a measurement; the
whole run is abandoned rather than printed with an OOM sitting in the FAIL
column where a reader would count it as evidence.

THE THREE LEGS
--------------
``leg 1``  d01 and d02 both RESIDENT.  The control.  If the coupler is wrong
           here it is wrong independently of streaming, which is worth knowing
           on its own.
``leg 2``  d01 STREAMED (host store, tile that DIVIDES the domain, halo from
           ``harness.halo_radius`` and never from a sweep), d02 resident.
           PASS is: the carrier digests of BOTH domains are bit-identical to
           leg 1 and ``coupler.force_count`` is equal.
``leg 3``  the same with ``feedback=1``, so the parent's own prognostics are
           written from OUTSIDE ``dycore.step`` and a streamed parent must
           scatter them back into its store or lose them.

THE NEGATIVE CONTROL, WHICH IS TODAY'S CODE PATH
------------------------------------------------
``store_aware=False`` runs leg 2 with ``force()`` reading ``node.state``
exactly as it does on ``main``.  It MUST differ from leg 1.  If it does not,
the test cannot see the bug and proves nothing -- which is the whole reason it
is run first and printed as a control rather than assumed.

WHY THE COMPARISON IS AGAINST THE STORE AND NOT AGAINST THE STATE
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A streamed domain's truth is ``stepper.store``.  Comparing leg 2's
``node.state`` against leg 1's would compare a frozen snapshot against a
forecast and would "fail" for a reason that has nothing to do with nesting.
Every d01 digest below is taken from the store when d01 streams and from the
state when it does not; d02 is resident in every leg and is always taken from
its state.

CADENCE IS PRINTED, NOT ASSUMED
-------------------------------
``radt_minutes = 12`` and ``cudt_minutes = 5`` at a 9 s parent step put
radiation 80 steps apart and cumulus 33 apart, so a 20-step window fires each
of them exactly ONCE, at the first step -- MEASURED, printed as
``rad=1 cu=1``, and identical on both sides.  Symmetric is enough for a
bit-exactness claim and is NOT enough for coverage, so the ``full fast
cadence`` rung sets ``radt_minutes = 0.15`` (one parent step) and
``cudt_minutes = 0.3``, which fires both many times inside the same window.
Every leg prints its ``call_counts`` -- both sides of every comparison, not
just the reference -- so the reader can see the numbers rather than trust that
they matched, and :func:`_require_fired` turns a zero at a ``_FULL`` rung into
a GATE FAILURE rather than a printed 0 nobody reads.

Printing them is not enough if the print reads the wrong key, which it did.
``_cadence`` reported ``pbl=counts.get("pbl", 0)`` and
:class:`woof.core.physics.PhysicsDriver` has no ``pbl`` counter -- the PBL is
counted as ``ysu`` (physics.py:3445), beside ``sfclay`` and ``noah``.  So this
gate printed a hard ``pbl=0`` on every leg of every rung, including the legs in
which YSU ran on all 20 steps, and the single line a reader would audit to
answer "did the physics fire on both sides" answered "no" for a scheme that
fired every step.  The counters are now named from the driver's own
initialiser and an ABSENT key prints ``?``, because an unmeasured quantity and
a measured zero are different claims.

That is also how this gate caught its own first false result.  The warmup
step every domain takes to allocate the lazily allocated carriers left
``elapsed_seconds`` at 9 s; the resident leg then had it reset to 0 by
``refresh_model_time`` and the streamed leg carried on from 9 s, so radiation
fired twice on one side and once on the other and 117 of 155 d01 carriers
differed.  Nothing to do with nesting.  See :func:`rewind_clock_carriers`.
