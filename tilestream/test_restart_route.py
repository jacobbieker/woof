"""The four legs, through WOOF's OWN single-domain run loop.

``tilestream/test_restart_gate.py`` proved that a restart can be written from
a pinned host store and read back into one: it drives ``run_tiled`` directly
and calls :mod:`tilestream.restart_stream` by hand.  That is the transport.
It is NOT the operation a user performs, which is ``woof run`` -- and the
thing standing between the two is :func:`woof.runtime.integrate_prepared_case`,
the loop that owns the restart CADENCE, the checkpoint FILENAME, the
``run_trackers`` continuity block, the resume arithmetic and the decision of
what object to hand the restart writer.  Nothing had ever streamed through it.

This module runs the four legs THROUGH THAT LOOP::

    streamed  -> file -> streamed
    streamed  -> file -> resident
    resident  -> file -> streamed
    resident  -> file -> resident

Each leg is two calls to ``integrate_prepared_case``: the first integrates
0 -> 1800 s and lets the loop's own ``restart_interval_s`` cadence write the
checkpoint, the second is handed that checkpoint as ``restart_path`` and
integrates on to 3600 s.  PASS is that all four final domains are bit-identical
over all 229 carriers, to each other AND to an uninterrupted 3600 s run of each
mode.  The uninterrupted runs are what keep the legs accurate: four resumed runs
that agreed with each other and with nothing else would prove only that the
bug is deterministic.


WHAT THE LOOP DID BEFORE, AND WHY IT LOOKED LIKE IT WORKED
----------------------------------------------------------
``integrate_prepared_case`` wrote its checkpoint with
``write_restart(path, state, cfg)``.  ``state`` is the prepared resident
:class:`~woof.core.state.DomainState`.  Under streaming the domain's carriers
are in the stepper's store -- ``streaming.attach`` copied them out and the
state has been frozen at its preparation values ever since -- so that call
does not fail and does not warn.  It writes a complete, internally consistent,
229-member checkpoint OF THE INITIAL CONDITION, stamped with the current
model clock and the current ``run_trackers``.  ``validate_manifest_checkpoint``
passes it.  Every fingerprint in ``restore_restart`` matches, because the
setup and the physics setup really are this run's.  The file resumes cleanly
into a forecast that silently threw away every step taken.

That is the negative control this gate runs (``resident writer on a streamed
domain``), and it is expressed the way the defect would actually reach
production: the streamed stepper is wrapped in a plain function, so
``streaming.is_streaming`` says False, the loop takes the resident branch, and
the leg is run end to end.  It MUST differ.  A second control removes the
clock reseed from the restore and it MUST differ too.


THE CADENCES FIRE ON BOTH SIDES, AND THE NUMBERS ARE PRINTED
------------------------------------------------------------
Three of this project's six false results were the same mistake: a number
measured in a window where radiation and cumulus never fired.  At
``radt_minutes = 12``, ``cudt_minutes = 5`` and ``dt = 30 s`` radiation is due
every 24 steps and cumulus every 10, and each half of this run is 60 steps.
The per-window fire counts are read out of the checkpoint headers -- they are
``call_counts``, a restart carrier -- and PRINTED for every leg on both sides
of the split.  A leg whose second half fired no radiation is reported as such
rather than counted as a pass.


WHAT THIS GATE IS NOT
---------------------
It is not ``woof run``.  The CLI's single-domain route,
:func:`woof.runtime.run_experiment`, builds no streamed stepper at all --
before this branch it read ``[tiles]``, validated it, echoed it into the
resolved-config report and then integrated RESIDENT without saying so; it now
refuses instead.  Wiring it needs a per-domain builder (store filled from the
prepared state, tile buffers on the domain's own physics selectors, geography
inventoried, boundary tables windowed per tile) which is a different piece of
work from the restart, and a real ``woof run`` additionally needs a real GFS
or HRRR ingest that no bit-exactness gate can use anyway (see
``tilestream/REAL-DATA.md``).  So this drives the loop that route calls, with
the stepper supplied here, on the harness's real Lambert projection, real
terrain and specified lateral boundaries.

Two things inside the loop are deliberately kept out of the window, and both
are proven elsewhere: history output (``history_interval_s`` is set beyond the
run, so ``write_case_output`` is called once for the cold start and is stubbed
here -- streamed output is ``tilestream/test_io.py``'s subject), and with it
the REFL_10CM consume-once handshake, which never arms because no output is
ever due.
