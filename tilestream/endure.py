"""A FORECAST-LENGTH streamed run: thousands of steps, and what breaks over them.

Every bit-exactness result in this project was taken over 8 to 48 steps.  That
is enough to prove the ARITHMETIC -- the gather rectangles, the halo, the
clock, the per-tile boundary windowing -- and it proves nothing whatsoever
about a run that lasts four hours.  An 18-hour forecast at dt = 15 s is 4320
steps; at 672^2 x 49 streamed that is 4320 sweeps, 4320 x 4 tile gathers,
4320 x 4 scatters and 58 TB across PCIe.  The failure modes that live at that
length are invisible at 48 steps and all of them are silent until they are
fatal:

*A pinned leak.*  Page-locked pages cannot be swapped, so a store that grows
1 MiB per sweep does not get slower, it kills the box.  ``/proc/meminfo`` on
these rented machines reports the HOST's memory rather than the container's,
and page-locked pages are ordinary anonymous RSS as far as
``/proc/self/status`` is concerned (``VmLck`` counts ``mlock``, which
``cudaHostAlloc`` does not use).  So the only accurate instrument is the
process's own ledger, which is why :func:`tilestream.hoststore.pinned_ledger`
exists and why this module samples it every step rather than at the end: a
leak has to be visible as a TREND, because the alternative -- inferring one
from a final allocation failure -- cannot distinguish a leak from a store
that was always too big.

*Device fragmentation.*  ``PhysicsDriver`` REPLACES whole tendency bundles
when the owning scheme runs, so a run at forecast cadence allocates and frees
device memory in a pattern that a 48-step gate never reaches: radiation fires
every 48 steps and cumulus every 20, and each firing churns the pool.  The
question is not whether VRAM grows -- CuPy's pool grows on purpose and
plateaus -- but whether it plateaus.

*Clock drift.*  ``elapsed_seconds`` is a float accumulated by ``+= dt`` inside
``dycore.step``, once per CALL, and it is the argument to every cadence test.
Over 4320 steps at dt = 15 s it reaches 64800.0; the check here is EXACT
equality against ``nsteps * dt``, not a tolerance, because dt = 15 is
representable and any drift at all would mean the clock is being reconstructed
rather than carried.

*Step-time decay.*  Answered by comparing deciles, not endpoints.

THE INSTRUMENT THAT NEVER FIRED IS NOT AN INSTRUMENT
----------------------------------------------------
``--leak-mib`` retains that many MiB of pinned memory every ``--leak-every``
steps.  It exists so the leak detector can be shown to SEE a leak: with it on
the reported slope must match the injected rate, and with it off the slope
must be zero.  A memory-flatness verdict from a detector that has never
reported anything else is not evidence.

WHY THE TWO LEGS RUN IN ONE PROCESS
-----------------------------------
``--mode pair`` integrates the same forecast twice from the same t0 snapshot:
once resident through ``woof.core.dycore.step`` and once streamed through
:class:`woof.core.streaming.StreamedDomain`, and compares carrier digests at
every checkpoint rather than only at the end.  Comparing only the end says
"they agree" or "they do not"; comparing the series says WHICH step they
stopped agreeing at, which is the difference between a result and a bug
report.  Both legs are driven by the callable
:func:`woof.core.streaming.make_stepper` returned -- ``dycore.step`` itself
for the resident leg, by the OFF contract -- so the loop below is the same
loop twice and the only variable is that object.

ONE SWEEP PER CALL, WHICH IS ALSO WHY THE CLOCK CAN BE READ AT ALL
------------------------------------------------------------------
``driver.run_tiled(store, cfg, ..., nsteps=N)`` writes the domain clock back
into the caller's ``scalars`` dict only after ALL N steps (driver.py, end of
``_sweep``), so a progress callback inside such a call reads a frozen clock --
measured: a 240-step call reported ``model 0.2 min`` at every one of its
240 steps while the run really did advance to 60.2 minutes.  Nothing was
wrong with the model; the caller had asked for one sweep of 240 steps rather
than 240 sweeps of one.  This module drives ``stepper(state, cfg)`` once per
model step, which is what WOOF's own run loops do, and the clock is live.
