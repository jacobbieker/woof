"""THE REAL-DATA GATE: a slab-ingested store must equal a monolithic one, exactly.

Run it::

    python -m tilestream.test_realdata        # from the repository root

Every other gate in this prototype seeds its state from
``numpy.random.default_rng``.  This one reads a GRIB.  It initialises
``configs/real74_d01``'s own 250x200x49 CONUS Lambert domain from the April 3
1974 ERA5 bundle -- real terrain, real map factors, real Coriolis, real
analysed winds, temperature and moisture -- twice: once the way ``woof``
does it today (one full-domain ``DomainState`` on the GPU) and once the way a
domain larger than VRAM must (one row slab at a time, straight into pinned
host RAM), and requires the two to be byte-identical.

WHY BYTE-IDENTICAL IS THE ONLY USEFUL BAR
-----------------------------------------
Every failure mode this lane has is SMOOTH.  A slab written one row off, a
slab that rebuilt its own projection, a v face that took the domain-edge
branch at a slab seam -- each of them produces a finite, plausible,
correctly-shaped field that differs from the truth by a fraction of a
percent.  ``allclose`` passes all three.  Only an exact comparison
distinguishes "the ingest is correct" from "the ingest is nearly correct",
and nearly correct is how this project has been wrong six times.

WHAT IS COMPARED, SECTION BY SECTION
------------------------------------
``--grid-only``
    :func:`tilestream.realdata.window_grid` against the parent grid's own
    slice, for ten derived fields in both axes.  Its negative control is
    :func:`tilestream.realdata.rebuilt_grid` -- a projection rebuilt from the
    window's extents, which is what a slab gets if nobody thinks about it --
    and the control reports how far the rebuilt window lands from the truth,
    in degrees and in kilometres.

``--ingest-only``
    The slab ingest against the monolithic ingest at the FULL real74 domain,
    for slab heights from the whole domain down to a single row, over both
    the 13 carriers and the 13 geography arrays.  Four negative controls, each
    naming a different way this could have been faked:

    * ``y_halo=0`` -- the slab does not carry the mass row below its first.
      ``real.py:1939``'s v-face pressure average then takes its own edge
      branch at every interior seam.  MEASURED: ``state/v`` alone, in exactly
      ``nslabs - 1`` rows, by up to 2.1 m/s.  It is the smallest wrong answer
      in this file and the one most likely to ship.
    * ``row_shift=1`` -- every slab written one row too high.
    * ``force_kind='mass'`` -- the staggering rule ignored, so the closing
      v face at row ``ny`` is never written by anybody.
    * ``grid_fn=rebuilt_grid`` -- every slab derives its own projection.

``--steps-only``
    A store filled from real data, streamed through
    :func:`tilestream.driver.run_tiled`, against a monolithic run from the
    same real data.  Bit-exact over the whole carrier set, at six geometries
    (both domains, one and two buffers, shadow and ring write modes, 8-row and
    1-row ingest slabs), with three negative controls.

    THE PERIODIC CAVEAT, stated here rather than in a footnote.  The tiled
    lane is bit-exact under PERIODIC lateral boundaries; ``real74_d01`` runs
    ``specified=True`` with ERA5 boundary frames, and specified boundaries in
    the tiled lane are a different workstream.  So this section closes the
    domain periodically (:func:`tilestream.realdata.periodic_closure`, applied
    identically to both sides) and pays a real price for it, which
    :data:`STEP_DT_NATIVE` documents with the measurement: wrapping a real
    analysis onto itself is a grid-scale shock, the first ``|w|`` maximum
    lands on the seam column, and the growth is ~2x per step AT EVERY dt from
    30 s down to 0.5 s -- so it is the wrapped configuration that is
    ill-posed, not the timestep.  It is not the terrain either: the flat-ocean
    window fails at step 2 just as fast.

    Two consequences, both visible in the output.  The row at the case's own
    dt=30 s gets N=1, which is every step it has.  The multi-step rows run at
    dt=0.1 s, the largest step in the sweep that stays finite for eight, where
    ``|w|`` grows 0.01 -> 0.18 m/s.  Every row reports ``nan_free``, because a
    bit-exact comparison of two NaN fields is not evidence of anything.

    THE DYNAMICS-ONLY REAL74 PATH IS ITSELF UNSTABLE IN THIS TREE, and that is
    a finding, not an excuse.  With the case's OWN ``specified=True`` boundary
    frames built from all three ERA5 times -- no periodic anything --
    ``verify.cases.real74_d01.config()`` at dt=30 s reaches ``|w|`` = 1.3 m/s
    after one step and 1.06e10 m/s after two, and the blowup is centred at
    ``j = 4``, inside the relax zone.  That is consistent with the defect
    ``tilestream-bcfix`` describes (the small-step uv kernels wrapped the
    boundary face column mass unconditionally, so on a specified domain the
    west boundary drew its mass from the east-most column); this file does not
    depend on it either way, because both of its sides run the same dycore.

#: MEASURED, on the monolithic side, counting steps that stay finite out of 8:
#:
#: ==============  =====  =====  =====  ======  ======  ======
#: domain           dt=30  dt=6   dt=2   dt=0.5  dt=0.1  dt=0.05
#: ==============  =====  =====  =====  ======  ======  ======
#: real74 d01        1      -      2      3       6       8
#: Atlantic 64x64    1      2      2      4       8       -
#: ==============  =====  =====  =====  ======  ======  ======
#:
#: A periodic wrap of a real analysis is a genuine grid-scale shock: the first
#: |w| maximum lands on the seam column (i = 249 at dt=30, i = 0 at dt=2), and
#: the growth rate is ~2x PER STEP whatever dt is, which is what says it is a
#: numerical instability of the wrapped configuration and not a CFL violation.
#: It is NOT the terrain either: the Atlantic window's terrain is sea level to
#: within 0.3 m and it fails at step 2 just as fast at dt=30.
#:
#: So the row at the case's own dt=30 gets the one step it has, and the
#: multi-step rows run at the largest dt in the sweep that stays finite for
#: eight -- 0.1 s on the window, where |w| grows 0.01 -> 0.18 m/s and the
#: state stays recognisably the analysis.  Nothing about the halo changes with
#: dt: ``harness.halo_radius`` is a function of ``time_step_sound`` alone.
