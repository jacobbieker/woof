"""A real wrfout history file, written from the streamed case's host store.

WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHAT IT IS NOT
----------------------------------
``woof render --engine rust`` -- the production renderer, and the tier the
campaign material comes out of -- reads **wrfout NetCDF**.  The streamed case
run has no resident ``DomainState`` to hand ``woof.io.wrfout.state_frame``:
the domain lives in pinned host RAM and only a halo tile is ever on the card.
So the frame is assembled on the host, out of the store, and handed to the
PRODUCTION ``WrfoutWriter`` -- the same class, the same schema table, the same
Registry types, the same create/validate/publish sequence a resident run uses.
Nothing about the file format is reimplemented here; what is written here is
only the *mapping* from streamed carrier keys to WRF history names.

WHICH FIELDS, AND WHY THOSE -- MEASURED AGAINST THE RENDERER
------------------------------------------------------------
A COMPLETE ``_device_state_frame`` at this rung is 122 fields, 31 of them
three-dimensional.  At 1200x900x49 that is **6.6 GB per frame** and a
15-minute history over ten forecast hours is forty-one of them: 270 GB, more
disk than the box has.  So the frame is a subset -- and the subset was
CHOSEN BY MEASUREMENT, by writing variants at 96x80 and asking
``woof render --list-products --engine rust`` how many products each one
actually supports:

===============================================  =========  ============
3-D rows written                                 file size  renderable
===============================================  =========  ============
14 (+ QCLOUD/QRAIN/QICE/QSNOW/QGRAUP)              25.1 MB      **164**
 9 (U V W PH PHB T P PB QVAPOR)                    17.5 MB      **164**
 8 (the same, without W)                           16.0 MB          163
===============================================  =========  ============

The five hydrometeor mixing ratios buy **nothing**: the catalog's radar
products read the stored ``REFL_10CM``, not a recomputed one, so carrying
them would cost 0.9 GB a frame and 37 GB over the run for zero extra
products.  Dropping ``W`` costs one.  So nine 3-D rows it is -- 2.5 GB a
frame at 1200x900x49, 164 of the catalog's products renderable, including
the whole CAPE/CIN/SRH/shear/STP severe suite, the 200-850 mb isobaric
families, MSLP, 2 m T/Td, QPF and composite reflectivity.

Also written and NOT part of the streamed carrier set: ``UP_HELI_MAX``,
without which ``composite_reflectivity_uh`` and ``uh_2to5km`` -- the two
products a severe-weather forecaster actually reaches for -- are refused.
**ITS TIME SEMANTICS DIFFER FROM WRF's AND THE FILE SAYS SO.**  WRF's
``UP_HELI_MAX`` is a running maximum between history writes; what this run
can compute is the INSTANTANEOUS 2-5 km updraft helicity at the frame's own
valid time (``woof.core.uh_diag``'s host mirror of ``cal_helicity``,
evaluated on the whole domain at the sweep seam, because the device lane
refuses a tiled periodic geometry by design).  Every file carries
``GPUWM_UP_HELI_MAX_SEMANTICS`` saying exactly that, and any figure made
from it must repeat it.

Not carried: the physics schemes' own 3-D diagnostics (MYNN's
QKE/TSQ/QSQ/COV, the eddy viscosities, Noah-MP's 3-D soil).  No product in
the catalog reads them; a reader who wants them wants a restart.

WHAT IS DERIVED AND HOW
-----------------------
``T``, ``P``, ``PB`` and ``PHB`` are not carriers -- the store holds the
*perturbations* -- so they are formed on the host in the DEVICE's own
arithmetic order.  ``T = (thb + thp) - 300``, not ``thp + (thb - 300)``:
float addition is not associative and the reassociated form changes a
quarter of T's bytes on an un-stepped state (measured on branch
``tilestream-output``, §12.1).  The base state is captured ONCE from the
time-zero domain state and reused, because it is input and nothing in a
forecast writes it.

WHEN A FRAME MAY BE TAKEN
-------------------------
At a SWEEP BOUNDARY only.  ``run_tiled``'s ring mode keeps one store and
every tile reads and writes it inside the same sweep, so a frame taken
mid-sweep mixes generations.  ``run_case_hrrr`` calls this from ``on_sweep``,
which is the seam, and after the lateral-boundary frame has been imposed --
so what is written is exactly the state the next sweep will step.
