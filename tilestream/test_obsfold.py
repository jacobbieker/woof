"""DEFECT 2: the run loop's safety gates observe a state the sweep never writes.

WHAT IS WRONG
-------------
``woof.runtime.integrate_prepared_case`` guards every dynamics substep with
three observers, and all three read the resident :class:`DomainState` object:

    runtime.py:2234   stability_report(state, integration_cfg, ...)  -> nan / w / CFL
    runtime.py:2212   health.require_healthy(...)   (StateHealthValidator(state))
    runtime.py:2232   health.require_healthy(...)   on a cadence
    runtime.py:2257   cp.max(state.physics.fields["swdown"])

``woof.core.model.execute_experiment`` does the same with
``StateHealthValidator(node.state)`` (model.py:843).

Under ``[tiles]`` with ``store = "host"`` the domain's arrays do not live
on that state.  :func:`woof.core.streaming.attach` copies the prepared
state's carriers into a pinned host store and every model step is a SWEEP over
that store: tiles are gathered to the card, stepped, and their interiors
scattered back to the store.  ``state`` is passed to ``StreamedDomain.__call__``
only to be CHECKED for identity -- its device arrays are never written again.

So the observers read a corpse.  It was healthy when the store was filled from
it, and it stays healthy forever:

* ``nan_free`` stays ``True`` no matter what the store does,
* ``w_max`` stays at the value it had at t=0,
* the CFL never moves,
* ``swdown_peak`` never moves,

and a run that went non-finite in the store completes "successfully" and
writes a checkpoint.  A silently disarmed NaN guard is indistinguishable from
a well-behaved forecast.  It is also a real GPU reduction per substep on data
nobody is using, so it is simultaneously wrong AND a measurable tax.

THE FIX, AND WHY IT IS LEGITIMATE
---------------------------------
Every quantity these observers compute is a MAX fold or an OR fold:
``u_max``, ``w_max``, ``th_max``, the boundary/interior ``w`` maxima and the
vertical CFL rate are maxima; ``nan`` is an OR of NaN flags.  Max and OR are
associative, commutative and idempotent, so they can be folded per tile inside
the sweep and combined -- and because float max is exact (it selects an
operand, it never rounds) the folded answer is BIT-IDENTICAL to the monolithic
one, not merely close.

The defect is which memory the reduction reads, not the mathematics.

Three details make the per-tile fold equal to the whole-domain one rather than
merely similar, and each is a place where a plausible implementation is wrong:

1.  **Interiors only.**  A tile's gathered array is interior + halo.  The halo
    is a copy of a neighbour's cells that this tile did not integrate, and on
    a domain edge it is seam fill (``zeros``/``poison``).  Folding it would
    reduce over values no monolithic run ever holds -- and with the poison
    seam it would report NaN on a perfectly healthy forecast.  The interiors
    of a plan partition the domain exactly once, which is what makes the union
    of per-tile folds the domain fold.

2.  **Domain indices, not tile indices.**  ``w_argmax`` breaks ties by LOWEST
    FLAT INDEX (``health.cu``'s ``update_max``), and the boundary/interior
    split is a function of the DOMAIN's ``(j, i)`` against
    ``spec_bdy_width``.  A fold that compares tile-local indices picks a
    different winner among equals and mislabels every tile's rim as a domain
    boundary.

3.  **The staggered faces are owned, not shared.**  ``u`` is ``(nz, ny, nx+1)``
    and a tile owns faces ``[i0, i1)`` plus, for exactly one tile, the closing
    alias/boundary slot ``nx``; likewise ``v`` in ``y``.  Folding ``[i0, i1]``
    on every tile would double-count shared faces (harmless for a max) but
    folding ``[i0, i1)`` on every tile and forgetting the closing slot DROPS a
    face -- and the dropped face is a domain edge, exactly where a blow-up
    starts.  :mod:`tilestream.spec` already owns this arithmetic; the fold
    asks it rather than re-deriving it.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES
---------------------
    python -m tilestream.test_obsfold --demonstrate   # the disarm + control
    python -m tilestream.test_obsfold --verify        # bit-exact w_max
    python -m tilestream.test_obsfold --price         # per-substep cost

``--demonstrate`` poisons the STORE (never the state) through the tile hook
and shows the streamed run completing with ``nan_free=True``; the identical
poison applied to the resident leg's state MUST raise, which is the positive
control that proves the comparison is capable of failing at all.
