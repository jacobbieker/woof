"""In-process build/step/hash harness for the out-of-core tiling spike.

Everything downstream of the de-risking spike builds against this module.  It
answers one question: can we construct a small ``DomainState``, call
``dycore.step`` on it repeatedly, and get a bit-reproducible answer, entirely
in process and with no data download?

Design notes that matter for tiling
-----------------------------------
* ``make_config`` defaults to a FULLY PERIODIC domain (``open_x=open_y=
  specified=nested=False``), flat terrain (``terrain_opt=0``) and identity map
  factors (``map_proj=0``).  Under those settings every setup array
  (``thb, pb, alb, phb, mub2d, ht, msft, msfu, msfv, f, e``) is horizontally
  UNIFORM and every vertical-coordinate array depends only on ``nz``.  That is
  what makes a tile's setup identical to the corresponding window of the full
  domain, which a tiled bit-exact gate requires.  Change those and the gate
  needs a setup gather too.
* :func:`make_geography` changes exactly that, on purpose.  It builds a REAL
  Lambert conformal grid (``configs/real74_d01.toml``'s ``map_proj=1`` at
  dx=dy=12 km) plus a latitude/longitude-anchored terrain, and the resulting
  ``msft/msfu/msfv/f/e/sina/cosa/ht`` and the terrain-following
  ``thb/pb/alb/phb/mub2d`` all vary horizontally.  A tile CANNOT rebuild
  them -- ``woof/static/projection.py:122-123`` defaults the reference
  point to the domain centre and ``_grid_xy`` (:176-179) counts DOMAIN
  indices, so a rebuilt tile believes it sits where the whole domain sits.
  They are gathered instead; :func:`tilestream.driver.geography_inventory`
  names them and ``run_tiled(geography=...)`` moves them.
* ``make_state`` deliberately re-implements the body of
  ``woof.verify.npref.random_acoustic_state`` instead of calling it, because
  that helper builds its OWN ``RunConfig`` from ``nx/ny/nz`` and we need to
  seed a state onto a config the caller already owns (a tile config differs
  from the parent only in ``nx``/``ny``).  The seeding amplitudes, field list,
  fill order and periodic-duplicate enforcement are copied verbatim from
  npref.py:2275-2314 so a state built here is byte-identical to one built by
  ``random_acoustic_state`` at the same seed and shape.  Verified by
  ``selftest_matches_npref`` below.
* ``hash_state`` hashes the STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS set -- the enforced persist
  list, which is exactly the streaming inventory.  ``hash_outputs`` is the
  benchmark's own ``_hash_outputs``, imported (not copied) from
  ``tools/benchmark_seeded_step.py``, kept as a cross-check.

def halo_radius(cfg) -> int:
    """Per-step horizontal dependency radius, in mass cells, for ``cfg``.

    ``3 * 3`` from the three RK stages' 5th-order advection plus one cell per
    acoustic substep.  The RK3 stages run ``1``, ``ns // 2`` and ``ns``
    substeps of ``dt / ns`` (dycore.py:2215-2219, :2329), so a step takes
    ``1 + 3 * ns // 2`` substeps in total::

        radius = 9 + 1 + 3 * ns // 2 = 10 + 3 * ns // 2

    ``ns = 4`` gives the established 16.  MEASURED by NaN-cone growth on a
    160x160x49 periodic domain: the per-step increment is 16 / 19 / 22 for
    ``ns`` = 4 / 6 / 8, matching this formula exactly.  ``h_sca_adv_order``
    (2 vs 5) does NOT change the radius -- measured identical.

    Note the radius is field-dependent by one cell of staggering: mass points
    grow 14/30/46 after 1/2/3 steps while ``w`` and the boundary-normal
    momentum grow 15/31/47.  This function returns the CONSERVATIVE 16-per-step
    figure that covers every field.

    PHYSICS DOES NOT WIDEN IT -- measured, not assumed.  On a 256x192x49
    domain split 4x4 into 64x48 tiles (a gathered tile is ~40% of the domain,
    so the halo genuinely decides the answer), with the whole restart
    manifest streamed, the smallest halo that is bit-exact against a
    monolithic run is:

    ===================  ====  ====  ====  ====  ====
    rung                  N=1   N=2   N=3   N=5   N=8
    ===================  ====  ====  ====  ====  ====
    dry                    14    14    14    14    14
    full + MYNN + Noah-MP  13    14    14    14    14
    full, fast cadence     14     -    14     -    14
    ===================  ====  ====  ====  ====  ====

    So 16 bounds every measured rung with two cells to spare, and the
    physics rungs need no more than the dry one.  That is what the influence-
    cone measurement predicted (dry and full physics agree within +-1 cell at
    every amplitude): every scheme in this build is column-local, so physics
    adds no horizontal reach.

    READ FACT 1 BEFORE TOUCHING THIS.  halo 13 at ``full+MYNN+Noah-MP`` is
    BIT-EXACT at N=1 and then differs in 13 / 34 / 107 / 111 carriers at
    N = 2 / 3 / 5 / 8.  A one-step test certifies a halo that is wrong, and
    the wrong one is faster.

    RADIATIVE-OPEN BOUNDARIES DO NOT WIDEN IT EITHER, and that was the open
    prediction.  ``apply_open_zero_gradient`` assigns STATE at the window's
    edge column rather than perturbing a tendency, so the cone was expected
    to be the full per-step radius and the margin to vanish.  MEASURED at
    256x192x49, dx = 12 km, tile 32x32, dry, N=8, on a 4090
    (``tilestream.probe_open_halo``): the smallest bit-exact halo is 14 with
    ``open_x`` alone and 13 with ``open_x`` and ``open_y``, against the same
    14 the dry periodic row reports.  The prescribed 16 clears them by 2 and
    3.  The prediction is refuted for the same reason the specified seams
    were safe: at the START of a step every window cell holds the domain's
    own value, and a perturbation introduced partway through the step has
    strictly less than a full step left to travel.

    A DIAGNOSTIC DOES WIDEN IT, WHICH PHYSICS DOES NOT (2.2.0)
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    Everything above is about the CARRIER set: what a step reads in order
    to integrate the next one.  ``nwp_diagnostics = 1`` adds a consumer of
    a different shape -- ``woof.core.uh_diag`` evaluates ``UP_HELI_MAX``
    in the dycore EPILOGUE from a horizontal stencil two cells wide
    (vorticity radius 1, then the 9-point smoother's radius 1 on top of
    it; :data:`woof.core.uh_diag.UH_DIAGNOSTIC_HALO_CELLS`).  Physics adds
    no horizontal reach because every scheme in this build is column-local.
    This is not physics, and it reads its neighbours at the one instant in
    the step when a tile's halo has already been eaten from the outside in
    by that step's own dependency cone.

    The prescribed 16 clears the measured minimum of 14 by exactly 2, so
    the diagnostic consumes the whole margin and leaves none.  MEASURED at
    the 2.2.0 cut on a 438x350x49 run at tile 200x200: 74 of 75 fields
    bit-identical to the resident twin, and ``UP_HELI_MAX`` differing at
    ONE cell -- ``(j=331, i=200)``, 1.16e-10, one float32 ULP, at exactly
    the first interior column of the second tile, which is the signature
    of a stencil reaching one cell past what the halo still guarantees.
    The same configuration at halo 18 is bit-identical in all 75 fields at
    every frame.

    So the radius is widened by the diagnostic's own reach whenever the
    diagnostic is on -- by default, with no flag to set: a run that emits
    ``UP_HELI_MAX`` gets a correct one.  It changes no forecast, since the
    trajectory is bit-exact for any halo at or above 14, and it costs 4
    cells on each window axis (MEASURED on that run: 232x232 windows to
    236x236, 6.61 GiB of VRAM to 6.71 GiB).
