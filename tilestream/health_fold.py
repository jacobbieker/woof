"""The run loop's stability report, folded per tile inside the sweep.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
``woof.runtime.integrate_prepared_case`` guards every dynamics substep with
``stability_report(state, ...)`` (runtime.py:2234) and raises when it reports a
non-finite state.  Under ``[tiles]`` with a host store the domain's arrays
are NOT on that state: :func:`woof.core.streaming.attach` copies the prepared
state's carriers into pinned host memory and every model step is a sweep of
tiles through the card.  The state is never written again, so the report is
taken on a corpse -- healthy at t=0 and healthy forever.  ``nan_free`` stays
``True`` through a run that went entirely non-finite in the store, ``w_max``
stays at its t=0 value, and the run writes a checkpoint and calls itself a
forecast.  MEASURED: a 128 x 128 x 49 streamed run whose store held 819 196
non-finite ``w`` cells out of 819 200 completed 20 of 20 steps reporting
``nan_free=True`` and a constant ``w_max``.

It is also a per-substep GPU reduction over the whole resident domain that
nobody is using -- so the defect is simultaneously a wrong answer and a tax.

WHY FOLDING IS ALLOWED
----------------------
Everything in the report is a MAX fold (``u_max``, ``w_max``, ``th_max``, the
boundary and free-interior ``w`` maxima, and the co-located ``|w|/dz`` rate) or
an OR fold (the per-field NaN flags).  Both are associative, commutative and
idempotent, and float max is EXACT -- it selects an operand and never rounds --
so the per-tile fold is bit-identical to the whole-domain reduction rather than
close to it.  The blocking is irrelevant for the same reason, including the
argmax: ties are broken by lowest DOMAIN index, which is a property of the
data, not of the launch geometry.

The defect was which memory the reduction read, not the mathematics.

WHAT IS EASY TO GET WRONG, AND IS THEREFORE A PARAMETER HERE
------------------------------------------------------------
* **Interiors, never halos.**  The window is :meth:`TileSpec.interior_in_tile`
  -- the exact set the scatter writes -- so the union over a plan covers the
  domain once.  A tile's halo holds a neighbour's cells it did not integrate,
  and at a domain edge it holds seam fill; on a ``poison`` seam, folding the
  halo would report NaN on a perfectly healthy forecast.
* **Domain indices.**  ``w_argmax`` and the boundary/interior split are
  computed from ``(spec.j0 + jj, spec.i0 + ii)``, not from tile-local indices.
* **The closing staggered face.**  ``interior_in_tile("u")`` already adds the
  ``nx`` slot to whichever tile owns it, so the fold asks ``spec`` instead of
  re-deriving ownership and dropping a domain-edge face.
