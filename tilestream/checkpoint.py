"""Writing and READING BACK a wrfrst restart when the domain is host-resident.

``woof/io/restart.py`` serializes a checkpoint by walking a live
``DomainState`` and a live ``PhysicsDriver``.  A streamed run has neither at
full domain shape: the authoritative state is a pinned
:class:`tilestream.hoststore.HostDomainStore`, and the only ``DomainState``
that exists is one halo tile.  This module closes that gap in both
directions -- a checkpoint written FROM the store, and a checkpoint read back
INTO one -- and it does so without a second copy of restart.py's
classification tables.

THE FACT THAT MAKES THIS CHEAP
------------------------------
``tilestream.physics_inventory.carrier_manifest`` is built by CALLING
``restart.state_manifest`` / ``restart._scratch_manifest`` /
``restart._driver_manifest``.  So the streaming carrier set and the restart
archive's member set are not merely compatible, they are THE SAME SET,
computed by the same enforced code.  Measured at ``full(real74) +KF``,
48x40x49: 155 carriers, 155 archive members, symmetric difference EMPTY.

One qualification, added with ``restart.CARRIED_SCRATCH_SLOTS``: the store is
the CROSS-STEP set and the archive is the SERIALIZED one, and those differ by
exactly that class -- the two ``nwp_diagnostics`` tracker windows, two
``(ny, nx)`` planes, present only under ``nwp_diagnostics = 1``.  A window
means "max since that consumer last looked" and no file knows when the
consumer will next look, so it is carried and never written.  The write
filters through ``physics_inventory.checkpointed_carriers`` and the read
zeroes the complement.

The store therefore already holds every array a restart needs, keyed by the
archive's own member names (``state/thp``, ``scratch/mp_rainnc``,
``driver/pbl_tendencies/ru``, ``fields/ust``, ``cumulus/w0avg``).  Nothing
has to be collected, converted or renamed at checkpoint time; the write is
the store's own bytes plus a header.

WHAT IS NOT IN THE STORE, AND WHY IT CANNOT BE FAKED FROM A TILE
----------------------------------------------------------------
The header is.  Four of its fields are functions of the DOMAIN and a tile
cannot supply them:

``config``
    Trivially the domain's -- but ``_configuration_fingerprint`` folds
    ``nx``/``ny`` in, so a tile's config hashes differently.

``setup_fingerprint``
    SHA-256 over ``STATE_SETUP_ARRAYS`` -- the base state, the vertical
    coordinate, the map factors, the Coriolis parameter, the terrain -- plus
    ``STATE_SETUP_SCALARS`` and the whole lateral-boundary forcing table.
    Domain-shaped by construction.  MEASURED at 48x40 vs a 32x24 tile:
    ``37e63e71...`` vs ``9a2abf9c...``.

``physics_setup`` / ``physics_setup_fingerprint``
    Resolved scheme identity.  Almost all of it is config- and
    asset-derived and a tile computes it correctly, but TWO members are
    domain-shaped geography: the radiation callable's ``latitude_deg`` /
    ``longitude_deg`` grid, and -- under ``sf_surface_physics=4`` -- Noah-MP's
    ``NoahmpSolarGeometry`` lat/lon.  MEASURED: computing the identity from a
    tile driver leaves exactly those three digests differing at
    ``full+MYNN+Noah-MP`` and two shape entries at every radiation rung; with
    both grids substituted the identity is IDENTICAL at every rung tested
    (mp10, RRTMGP, full+KF, full+MYNN+Noah-MP).

``elapsed_seconds`` and the driver call counts
    The scalar carriers.  ``physics_inventory.carrier_scalars`` already
    carries them through a tiled sweep because every physics cadence test
    reads them; the header is the same three numbers.

This is why the header cannot be built from the tile that happens to be in
the buffer.  It is ALSO why building it from a tile is a genuinely dangerous
shortcut rather than a merely wrong one: a checkpoint whose setup fingerprint
was computed from a tile would be REJECTED by a monolithic resume (fail
closed, fine) but ACCEPTED by another streamed resume that made the same
mistake -- so the fingerprint would silently stop protecting against resuming
onto different terrain, a different projection or a different base state.
:func:`tilestream.test_io.negative_tile_fingerprint` is that control.

:class:`DomainSetup` is the answer: capture the domain's setup ONCE, at
preparation, when it is known, and carry it beside the store.  It is INPUT,
exactly like the geography the tile gather needs, and it is small -- MEASURED
0.780 B/cell at 48x40x49, 0.747 at 96x80x49 and 0.735 at 512x496x49, against
233.6 B/cell of carriers at ``full(real74) +KF``, i.e. **0.31% of the store**.
The asymptote is exact and worth knowing: nine of the twenty-nine setup
arrays are horizontal (``mub2d ht msft msfu msfv f e sina cosa``) and the
other twenty are 1-D columns, so the cost is ``9 * 4 / nz`` B/cell = 0.735 at
nz=49 and everything above that is the vertical arrays amortising away.  A
run that streams a domain too large for VRAM can hold it three hundred times
over.

THE ROUND TRIP IS THE POINT
---------------------------
A checkpoint that only its own writer can read is not a checkpoint.  The
files this module writes are ordinary v5 woof restarts: byte-for-byte the
same members in the same order with the same header keys as
``restart.write_restart`` produces from a resident state, and
``restart.restore_restart`` reads them with no changes at all.
:mod:`tilestream.test_io` proves all four legs -- streamed->streamed,
streamed->monolithic, monolithic->streamed, and the uninterrupted control --
bit-exact.

WHAT THIS MODULE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
-----------------------------------------
It does not re-derive the header layout.  :func:`store_restart_header`
composes the same dict ``restart.write_restart`` composes, from the same
functions, and :func:`tilestream.test_io.case_header_equivalence` compares
the result key-for-key and member-for-member against a real
``write_restart`` at a size where both are possible.  If restart.py grows a
header key or bumps ``RESTART_FORMAT_VERSION``, that comparison fails --
which is the only drift guard worth having, because a guard that reads the
other module's source would pass while the semantics moved underneath it.
