"""OPEN LATERAL BOUNDARIES, streamed: does a tile know which of its four
window edges is a REAL domain edge?

``cfg.open_x`` / ``cfg.open_y`` select WRF's Klemp-Wilhelmson radiative-open
lateral boundary: the advection kernels take open loop bounds and drop the
boundary-normal flux at the two boundary faces
(:func:`woof.core.advection._launch`), the small-step u/v kernels clamp
instead of wrapping the boundary-face column mass
(``dycore._boundary_x``/``_boundary_y``), an outbound-only radiative term is
added to the coupled slow tendency at the boundary-normal velocity faces
(``dycore.apply_open_radiative_bc``) and the boundary COLUMN's theta, w,
tangential velocity and moisture are OVERWRITTEN from their first interior
neighbour at the end of every RK stage wherever the flow is outbound
(``dycore.apply_open_zero_gradient``).

Nothing in ``tilestream`` had ever run with either flag set.  ``autoplan
.is_periodic`` reads them only to decide that a tile window must not wrap.

WHY THIS IS NOT THE SPECIFIED-BC PROBLEM IN A DIFFERENT COSTUME
---------------------------------------------------------------
:func:`woof.core.streaming.window_interval` solved the specified case by
giving a tile's TRUE domain edges the domain's own tables and its interior
seams inert ones, and the reason inert seams are provably safe is stated in
its docstring: specified forcing perturbs the RK TENDENCY, so its influence
cone is strictly inside the dycore's own and the halo covers it with room to
spare -- measured, zeros / self / 1e6-poison seam tables all bit-identical
out to N=24.

An open boundary is not a tendency.  ``apply_open_zero_gradient`` assigns
STATE at the window's edge column, three times per step (once per RK stage),
and the open advection bounds stop computing tendencies for the three
columns nearest each face.  A state perturbation present at the start of a
step has exactly the dycore's own dependency radius as its cone, and that
radius IS the halo (``harness.halo_radius``).  Marginal by construction --
and marginal is how a too-small halo hides: silently, and faster.

WHAT ``harness.tile_config`` DOES WITH THE FLAG
----------------------------------------------
``harness.tile_config`` (harness.py:178-186) replaces ``nx``/``ny`` and
carries every other field of ``RunConfig`` through untouched, and
``driver.TiledRun`` builds ONE ``tile_cfg`` for every buffer
(driver.py:1159).  So with ``open_x=True`` every tile buffer applies the
open-boundary treatment at BOTH of its x window edges -- including the ones
that are interior seams hundreds of kilometres inside the domain.

There is no per-tile spelling of "open on the west only": ``RunConfig`` has
one ``open_x`` for both x sides, where WRF carries ``open_xs`` and
``open_xe`` separately (share/module_bc.F).  A tile whose window spans the
whole axis owns both edges and is correct; a tile whose window spans neither
edge wants the flag OFF (its seams are then wrapped, which is what the halo
already covers, and which is exactly the proven periodic case); a tile that
owns exactly ONE x edge cannot be expressed at all.

THE SECOND DEFECT, WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF THE FIRST
----------------------------------------------------
``autoplan.is_periodic`` collapses BOTH axes into one boolean, and
``spec.plan_tiles`` takes one boolean.  ``open_x=True, open_y=False`` is a
domain that is non-periodic in x and genuinely PERIODIC in y
(``dycore._boundary_y`` is false, so every y stencil wraps).  ``is_periodic``
returns False, so ``plan_tiles`` CLAMPS the y windows into the domain
instead of wrapping them, and the south-most tile's row 0 is an owned cell
whose y neighbours the kernel takes by wrapping to row ``cny-1`` OF THE
WINDOW -- a row 64 cells away instead of the domain's row ``ny-1``.  Mixed
periodicity is not expressible in the plan.

THE ARMS
--------
``periodic``   the positive control the whole lane rests on; must pass.
``specified``  the positive control the join lane proved; must pass.
``open_x``     x open, y periodic.  Exercises BOTH defects.
``open_xy``    both axes open.  Both axes are non-periodic, so the clamping
               is right and this arm isolates the edge-conditional defect
               alone.

Every arm runs the same geometry, the same seed and the same halo, so the
only difference between them is four boolean fields of ``RunConfig``.

    python -m tilestream.test_open_bc              # the whole matrix
    python -m tilestream.test_open_bc --quick      # dry + fast cadence, N=1,8

RADIATION AND CUMULUS FIRE COUNTS ARE PRINTED FOR EVERY CASE, on both sides.
At ``dt=30 s`` with ``radt_minutes=12`` radiation is due every 24 steps and
cumulus every 10, so an N=8 window at the ordinary cadence fires NEITHER --
which is how three of this project's six false results happened.  The
``full fast cadence`` rung exists to make both fire on every step, and the
count is printed rather than assumed.
