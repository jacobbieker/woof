"""Tile geometry for the out-of-core streaming prototype: pure index arithmetic.

This module owns every slice the streaming pipeline uses.  It never touches a
GPU, imports neither cupy nor woof, and has no state -- a :class:`TileSpec` is
a frozen description of *where* a tile lives in the full domain and *where* its
cells land in the tile array.  ``gather.py`` / ``hoststore.py`` / ``driver.py``
consume it; if the arithmetic here is wrong, everything downstream is wrong in
a way that looks like a working speedup.


The grid and the staggering
---------------------------
Arrays are ``(nz, ny, nx)`` with x fastest.  Only the trailing two axes are
tiled; the vertical is never split.  WRF-ARW staggering means the four
horizontal *variants* have different array shapes for the same domain:

===========  ===================  ===========================================
variant      full-array shape     what an index means
===========  ===================  ===========================================
``"mass"``   ``(.., ny,   nx)``   cell centre ``i`` spans ``[i, i+1) * dx``
``"u"``      ``(.., ny,   nx+1)`` face ``i`` is the LEFT face of mass cell i
``"v"``      ``(.., ny+1, nx)``   face ``j`` is the SOUTH face of mass cell j
``"w"``      ``(.., ny,   nx)``   same horizontal layout as mass (``w``/``phi``
                                  stagger in z only)
===========  ===================  ===========================================

A tile covering mass columns ``[i0, i1)`` therefore needs ``u`` over the faces
``[i0, i1]`` -- one MORE than the mass count -- and ``v`` over ``[j0, j1]``.
Slicing every array identically is the single easiest way to produce a subtly
wrong forecast instead of a crash, so this module never lets a caller do it:
you ask for a variant and you get that variant's slices.


Periodicity, and the alias slot
-------------------------------
On a fully periodic domain there are only ``nx`` INDEPENDENT u faces.  The
array still carries ``nx+1`` of them and the convention -- the one
``harness.make_state`` seeds (``vals[..., -1] = vals[..., 0]``) and the dycore
maintains -- is that the last slot is a duplicate::

    u[..., nx] == u[..., 0]        v[..., ny, :] == v[..., 0, :]

This module calls slot ``nx`` the ALIAS SLOT.  Two consequences, both
deliberate:

* **Gathers never read the alias slot.**  A logical face index is reduced
  ``mod nx`` and read from ``[0, nx)``.  Reading slot ``nx`` instead would be
  numerically identical *only if* the duplicate invariant currently holds;
  reducing mod nx is correct by the definition of periodicity and holds even on
  a store whose duplicate has gone stale.  The cost is at most one extra copy
  segment per axis.
* **Exactly one tile writes the alias slot.**  Under ``periodic=True`` it is
  the tile whose interior contains mass column 0 (it copies its own logical
  face 0 into full slot ``nx``), which keeps the invariant true after every
  scatter.  Under ``periodic=False`` slot ``nx`` is a real boundary face and is
  owned by the last tile in x.  Either way the coverage count over the whole
  ``nx+1``-wide array is exactly one.


Who owns a shared face
----------------------
Adjacent tiles share the face between them.  **A tile owns the LEFT/SOUTH face
of every mass cell it owns** -- interior u faces are ``[i0, i1)``, interior v
faces are ``[j0, j1)`` -- plus the alias/boundary slot described above.  Face
``i1`` belongs to the next tile, as its own left face.  This gives no
double-writes and no unwritten faces, which the coverage test asserts by
counting.

The owned faces are far enough from the tile edge to be trustworthy: interior
u face ``i0`` sits at tile-local index ``halo``, i.e. ``halo`` cells from the
gathered array's edge, and the last owned face sits ``halo+1`` from the other
edge.


Ragged edges: pad the COMPUTE window, ragged the INTERIOR
---------------------------------------------------------
``nx`` need not divide by ``tile_nx``.  The policy here, chosen so that one
CUDA graph can serve every tile:

* the **compute window is always exactly** ``(tile_ny + 2*halo, tile_nx +
  2*halo)`` mass cells -- every tile, including the trailing ones.  Tile array
  shapes are uniform for a given variant, always.
* the **interior is ragged**: the trailing tile's interior is
  ``[i0, min(i0 + tile_nx, nx))``, which can be narrower than ``tile_nx``.  The
  compute window keeps its full width, so a short trailing tile simply carries
  a wider right halo (which, being periodic, is a redundant recomputation of
  cells that tile 0 owns).  Those cells are computed and thrown away.

So: uniform shapes, ragged ownership.  ``TileSpec.ragged_x`` /
``ragged_y`` say which tiles are short, and ``interior_nx`` / ``interior_ny``
give the real widths.  Nothing outside ``[i0, i1) x [j0, j1)`` is ever written
back, so the wasted work is bounded by one tile row/column of overlap.


Non-periodic domains
--------------------
``periodic=False`` is index arithmetic only -- milestone one is periodic and
the lateral-BC question is deferred.  What this module does under it: the
compute window is CLAMPED into ``[0, nx]`` instead of wrapping, by sliding the
window inward (``ci0 = clip(i0 - halo, 0, nx - cnx)``) rather than truncating
it.  Sliding keeps the uniform shape and keeps every gathered cell real; the
price is that the interior is off-centre in edge tiles (``halo_left`` /
``halo_right`` report the actual margins, and the margin on a domain-edge side
is smaller than ``halo`` because the domain boundary is right there).  It
requires ``tile_nx + 2*halo <= nx`` and raises otherwise.  A caller must still
decide what boundary condition an edge tile is stepped with; this module does
not know and does not pretend to.


Tiles wider than the domain
---------------------------
Under ``periodic=True`` a compute window wider than ``nx`` is supported: the
gather wraps onto itself and the tile array holds the domain repeated.  The
interior is still exact (its ``halo``-cell surround is a faithful periodic
image either way), but the tile contains duplicated columns and the work is
mostly wasted -- ``TileSpec.wraps_onto_itself`` flags it.  Under
``periodic=False`` it is a ``ValueError``.


Periodicity is PER AXIS, and it had to become so
------------------------------------------------
``periodic=`` sets both axes and is still the ordinary way to call
:func:`plan_tiles`; ``periodic_x=`` / ``periodic_y=`` override one axis.
That is not generality for its own sake.  ``cfg.open_x=True, open_y=False``
is a real WRF configuration -- the classic squall-line domain, radiative-open
across the flow and PERIODIC along it -- and for it ``dycore._boundary_x`` is
true while ``_boundary_y`` is false, so every y stencil in the model wraps.

A single plan-wide flag has no way to say that.  ``autoplan.is_periodic``
returned False (correctly: x is not periodic), the whole plan clamped, and
the south-most tile's row 0 became an owned cell with NO halo beneath it
while the kernels stepping it wrapped in y to row ``cny-1`` OF THE WINDOW --
a row 64 cells away instead of the domain's row ``ny-1``.

MEASURED, 256x192x49 at dx=12 km, tile 32x32, halo 16, one dry step,
``open_x=True, open_y=False``: all nine carriers differ, and the difference
is exactly rows 0-11 and 180-191 at every x -- the two y-boundary tile rows,
nothing else.  The x axis, where the open boundary actually lives, was clean.
With ``periodic_y=True`` the same case is bit-exact at N = 1, 3 and 8.

    cells; trailing tiles may own a narrower interior (see the ragged-edge

    ``periodic`` sets both axes; ``periodic_x`` / ``periodic_y`` override one.
    They must come from the CONFIG -- ``autoplan.is_periodic_x`` /

    wraps hands the boundary tile an owned row with no halo under it, and the
    kernels then wrap it to the far side of the WINDOW.  See the module
    docstring for the measurement.

    ``halo`` must be the per-step dependency radius for the config that will
    step the tiles -- ``tilestream.harness.halo_radius(cfg)``, which is 16 only
    when ``time_step_sound == 4``.  A halo that is too small silently corrupts

    ``plan_tiles`` clamps a tile's compute window into the domain, so a
    tile owns an edge exactly when its WINDOW reaches it
    (woof.core.streaming.owned_edges).  A specified domain's relaxation
    zone is applied only on the edges a tile owns (its seams relax nothing
    -- woof.ingest.lateral_bc.LateralBoundaries.seam_sides), so a zone
    cell in the window of a tile that does not own that edge is integrated

    halo's business, because the halo is the step's dependency radius: a
    zone cell of an unowned edge within ``halo`` of the tile's interior
    feeds the owned cells beside the seam every step, and the tiled run
    stops matching the resident one (at ratio 20 on 40-cell tiles every
    point differed after 15 minutes, the largest difference on the seam).
    A zone cell further out, which a window clamped against the far edge
    still holds, never reaches an owned cell within the step.

    In seam terms, for a window narrower than the axis: every seam sits at
    least ``band + halo`` cells from a forced edge, or no more than
    ``halo`` cells from it, where the window of the tile beside it is
    clamped out to that edge and owns it.  A window as wide as the axis
