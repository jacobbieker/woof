"""A REAL forecast, from a REAL analysis, streamed tile by tile.

Everything the streaming lane had run until now was periodic: ``test_gate``
says so in its own first paragraph -- *"Periodic is deliberate.  With
open_x=open_y=specified=nested=False every lateral-boundary special case
disappears, which removes the entire BC surface from the comparison."*  That
is the right choice for a bit-exact transport gate and it is the wrong world
for a forecast.  A real case is SPECIFIED: its edges are driven by an
analysis, on the analysis's own cadence, and the boundary treatment is not a
detail of the edge -- it is what puts the storms where they are.

This module is the missing piece, and the whole of it is one idea.


THE PROBLEM, STATED EXACTLY
---------------------------
``woof``'s lateral boundary is applied INSIDE the step
(``dycore.step`` -> ``lateral_bc.apply_state_lateral_boundaries`` at every RK
stage), on the outermost ``max(spec_zone, relax_zone)`` cells of whatever
array it is handed.  A tile buffer IS such an array.  So a tile is not
merely *allowed* to apply a boundary -- it is UNABLE NOT TO, once
``cfg.specified`` is set, and ``cfg`` is the domain's.

Four of a 4x4 tiling's sixteen tiles have no domain edge at all, and the
other twelve have one or two.  Every tile nonetheless has four compute-window
edges, and the relaxation kernel will treat all four of them.  Eight of the
sixteen tiles' twenty-four real edges are real; the remaining forty are
FICTION -- interior seams the kernel cannot tell apart from a domain edge.


THE ANSWER: THE FICTION IS QUARANTINED, AND THE HALO IS WHAT QUARANTINES IT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The streaming lane's entire correctness argument is a domain-of-dependence
argument: a tile's interior after one step depends only on cells within
``harness.halo_radius(cfg)`` of it at the start of the step, so a halo that
wide makes the interior exact.  The same argument absorbs the boundary,
because a spurious relaxation is not a special kind of wrongness -- it is
just a wrong value, at a known place, and wrong values propagate at the same
finite speed as right ones.

    A spurious boundary application touches at most the outermost
    ``B = max(spec_zone, relax_zone)`` cells of the compute window.
    Over one step that contamination reaches at most ``B + R`` cells in,
    where ``R = harness.halo_radius(cfg)``.  A halo of ``R + B`` therefore
    leaves every tile interior untouched by it.

:func:`halo_for` is that arithmetic and nothing else.  At WOOF's
``time_step_sound=4`` and WRF's standard ``spec_zone=1, relax_zone=4`` it is
``16 + 4 = 20``.  Nothing here is tuned: both terms are read off the config.

Two consequences, and both are essential:

*   THE PLAN MUST BE NON-PERIODIC.  ``spec.plan_tiles(periodic=False)``
    CLAMPS an edge tile's compute window into the domain instead of wrapping
    it, which is what makes the tile's own edge coincide with the domain's.
    Every tile keeps the same compute shape, so one ``tile_cfg`` still
    serves them all.  Under ``periodic=True`` the gathered window would wrap
    round the far side of the domain and the west boundary strip would be
    fed east-boundary air -- the same class of defect the ``bcfix`` commit
    removed from the small-step ``uv`` kernels one layer down.

*   THE TILE'S BOUNDARY TABLES ARE THE DOMAIN'S, WINDOWED.
    :func:`tile_boundaries` slices the domain's ``LateralBoundaries`` to each
    tile's compute window: west/east strips are cut in y at
    ``[cj0, cj0 + cny)``, south/north strips in x at ``[ci0, ci0 + cnx)``,
    each with the field's own staggering added.  A tile that owns the
    domain's west edge therefore relaxes toward THE ANALYSIS, at the right
    latitudes, on the right cadence.  A tile that does not gets real
    analysed air applied at the wrong place, which is fiction -- and lands
    entirely inside the quarantine.

That the fiction is bounded rather than merely small is why this is stated as
a proof and not as a hope, and :func:`gate` is the measurement:  a monolithic
specified run and a streamed one, from the same real initial state, over the
same real boundary series, compared carrier by carrier.


WHAT IS NOT SOLVED HERE
-----------------------
The INGEST is still monolithic.  ``runtime.prepare_real_case`` builds a
full-domain ``DomainState`` per forcing time, and MEASURED on this case that
peaks at far more device memory per cell than the forecast itself does --
so on any given card the largest domain that can be PREPARED is smaller than
the largest that can be STREAMED.  :mod:`tilestream.realdata` closes exactly
this gap for the dynamics carriers by row slabs and is bit-exact doing it;
what it does not yet do is the soil/landuse/physics-driver half of
``prepare_real_case``.  Until that lands, a streamed real forecast is capped
by its own preparation, and the accurate way to report a domain size is to say
which of the two limits it was up against.

    * it builds on ``make_vertical_coord``'s default stretch.  A real case
      runs its own eta table, and ``driver.geography_inventory`` deliberately
      does NOT gather the purely vertical setup arrays because a tile is
      supposed to rebuild them exactly.  ``coord`` here is the case's own.

    * it SEEDS every prognostic with Gaussian noise whose amplitudes were
      chosen against the harness's own 8 km-top config.  On this case's eta
      table -- whose lowest layer is ten times thinner (``znu[0]`` 0.9989
      against 0.9898) -- the seeded ``thp``/``mup`` drive the diagnosed
      temperature to 438 K and RRTMGP REFUSES the buffer's warmup step
      outright (valid over [160, 355] K).  MEASURED, and it is why this
      exists.  Nothing is lost by not seeding: every persisted array is
      overwritten by the first gather, and ``driver.make_tile_state``
      already argues that an at-rest buffer is the better failure mode --
      a field a gather failed to write shows up at rest rather than as
      plausible weather.

    ``qv`` is the one exception and it is not seeding: it is set to the
    analytic WK82 profile because RRTMGP and the microphysics both want a
    moist column for the single warmup step, whose only purpose is to force
    the lazily-allocated carriers into existence.

    ``boundaries`` must be a tile-shaped :class:`LateralBoundaries` whenever
    ``cfg.specified``: ``dycore.step`` calls
    ``apply_state_lateral_boundaries`` at every RK stage and that function
    REFUSES a specified config with nothing attached, so the buffer cannot
    take its warmup step without one.  Any tile's tables will do -- the
    warmup's values are overwritten by the first gather and the ``tile_hook``
    rebinds the right ones before the buffer serves a tile -- but the LAYOUT
    has to be the tile's, which is why this takes an argument rather than

    THE MEASUREMENT THAT MOTIVATES THIS.  Instrumented on this case at

    One ingest costs 3.151 GiB (17.1 kB per mass cell).  The peak is 5.528
    (30.0 kB/cell) and the whole difference is that ``initial_result`` and
    ``initial_met`` -- the START time's full-domain state and its
    interpolated analysis, 11.3 kB/cell of device memory -- are HELD for the
    entire loop while every later time is ingested underneath them.  That is
    correct and cheap on a domain that fits.  On a domain sized for the
    streaming lane it is the binding constraint, and it binds BEFORE the
    forecast does: at 35.9 kB/cell the largest preparable square on a 32 GiB
    card is about 910, while the measured vanilla FORECAST ceiling for the
    same physics is 928.  The ingest, not the integration, is what refuses
    first.

    The fix needs no new numerics, only an order.  ``StateBoundaryFrames``
    keeps four ``spec_bdy_width`` perimeter strips per time -- host memory,
    O(perimeter) -- and nothing else about a forcing time survives it except
    at the start time.  So the later times are ingested FIRST, each one
    released before the next is built, their perimeter snapshots stacked on
    the host; then the start time is ingested LAST and is the only state ever
    retained.  The snapshots are fed to the accumulator in TIME order, so the
    intervals and their tendencies are exactly the ones the in-order loop
    would have built -- the accumulator is a pure function of the snapshot
    sequence, which is why reordering the WORK cannot reorder the ANSWER.

    Everything after the loop -- soil, landuse, the physics driver, the
    time-zero surface diagnostics -- is ``prepare_real_case``'s own sequence,
    unchanged and in the same order, because it is O(domain) once rather than
    O(domain) per forcing time.

    the raw source SST with its own lat/lon for the per-body donor
    search, and route statics built from the full-domain LANDMASK and
    LU_INDEX.  Full-domain on purpose -- the slabbed preparer maps by row
    slab, and statics sliced to a slab would label a body crossing the
    slab seam as two bodies and could hand its halves different
    providers.  Because the slab mapping is bit-exact against the
    monolithic mapping (tilestream.realdata's proof), assembling the
    stitched full-domain fields here yields byte-for-byte the mainline
    route's decisions.

    Returns ``(assembly, policy)``; the caller forwards

    forcing time's ingest is still built at FULL DOMAIN WIDTH AND HEIGHT: the
    ERA5 interpolation writes ``(nlevel, ny, nx)`` and ``initialize_real``
    allocates a full ``DomainState``, so 21.0 kB/cell is a floor no ordering
    can move.  On a 32 GiB card that floor is about 1200^2 -- and on a SHARED
    card it is whatever is left over, which is why this exists: MEASURED on
    the rented boxes, a 960^2 preparation that needs 18 GiB is refused
    outright whenever another lane holds half the card, while the streamed
    FORECAST it feeds needs about 6 GiB and coexists happily.

    a row slab of ``interpolate_era5_to_lambert`` + ``initialize_real``, built

      * the slabs are written into ONE persistent full-domain ``DomainState``
        on the device, not into a host store, because everything after the
        ingest -- ``domain_boundary_snapshot``, ``initialize_physics``,
        ``update_diagnostics`` -- wants a resident state and costs O(domain)
        ONCE rather than per forcing time.  That state is 2365.8 B/mass cell
        of carriers plus 824.0 of geography: 2.8 GiB at 960^2, against the
        18.0 GiB the full-width ingest peaked at.
      * the 2-D outputs the soil/landuse/driver stages read -- the met
        surface fields, ``surface_pressure`` and ``surface_qv`` -- are
        assembled row by row from the same slabs, with the same
        staggering rule.

    The slab carries ``realdata.SLAB_Y_HALO`` = one mass row below its own
    first, and the reason is exactly one line of ``initialize_real``:
    ``_pressure_at_v`` averages the mass-point dry pressure onto y faces, so
    the v-face target at a slab's first row needs the mass row beneath it.
    Nothing else in the ingest reads across a row.

    ``refl10cm_hm`` walks one column of ``qr/nr/qs/ns/qg/ng`` against
    ``t``/``p`` and reads no neighbour -- so a bare row slab with no halo
    gives exactly the domain's answer, which is what lets a domain that does
    not fit be rendered at all.

    The base state (``thb``) is taken from the GEOGRAPHY store rather than
    rebuilt: on a ``terrain_opt=1`` domain it is 3-D and terrain-following,
    and a slab that rebuilt it from its own rows would rebuild it for a
    different domain.

    ``reflectivity=True`` carries ``scratch/refl_10cm``; that slot holds a
    field a microphysics call WROTE only once the settling step has computed
    it or a sweep carrying ``refl_10cm_due`` has filled it -- see
    :func:`reflectivity_run_kwargs`, and mark the case with
    :meth:`CaseStores.reflectivity_swept` after such a sweep.  In that state
    the array IS the model's reflectivity and is returned with no recompute
    and no slab loop: the only route for mp=9, 18 and 50, whose dBZ is
    produced inside the scheme call and published through no operator, and
    the only correct route for mp=8 and 28, whose ``compute_refl_10cm``
    branch needs the Thompson graupel-number shadow that the restart
    classifies as rebuilt and never serialises.

    A slot that is present but PRIMED -- a domain past the resident ceiling,

    as dBZ are a domain-wide 0 dBZ field that reads like weak echo.  The
