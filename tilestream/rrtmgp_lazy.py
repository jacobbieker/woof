"""RRTMGP's solver workspace, allocated at the firing and released after it.

WHY THIS CAN EXIST AT ALL
-------------------------
``SharedRRTMGPChunkWorkspace`` is one flat device allocation that every
solver phase lays its live set over, and ``RRTMGP_WORKSPACE_LIFETIME_AUDIT``
(woof/core/rrtmgp.py) names, slot by slot, the kernel or fill that writes
every element before its first read.  If that audit is true then the CONTENTS
of the backing at the top of a radiation call are irrelevant -- and if the
contents are irrelevant, so is the identity of the allocation.  A workspace
that is freed after one firing and freshly allocated for the next must give
bit-identical answers.

That is not an argument for doing it; it is only the argument that doing it
is *legal*.  The argument for doing it is the cadence.  At the production
``radt_minutes = 12, dt = 3 s`` radiation fires once every 240 steps, so the
shipped configuration holds the workspace resident for 239 steps that cannot
read a byte of it.

WHAT IT IS ACTUALLY WORTH -- READ THIS BEFORE BELIEVING IT IS FREE MONEY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Releasing bytes between firings lowers what the process HOLDS between
firings.  It lowers the process's PEAK only if the peak is somewhere other
than the radiation step, and at the shipped ``column_chunk = 3125`` the peak
is *on* the radiation step -- measured, see ``tilestream.rrtmgp_bench``.  So
on its own this buys nothing that a capacity bisection can see, and saying
otherwise would be the eighth false result in this project.

It becomes worth its full size in combination with a smaller column chunk.
Chunking shrinks the radiation step until some ordinary step becomes the
peak; from that point on every resident workspace byte is a byte added to a
peak that radiation no longer sets, and releasing it is a straight saving.
The two reclamations are therefore multiplicative, not additive, and neither
is worth much alone.

MECHANISM
---------
The backing is taken from a PRIVATE ``cupy.cuda.MemoryPool`` rather than the
default one.  That is the whole reason the saving is real rather than
bookkeeping: ``del`` on a default-pool array returns the block to the pool,
which keeps holding it against the device, so the device never sees it come
back.  A private pool can be emptied exactly -- ``free_all_blocks()`` on it
touches nothing else in the process -- and ``pool.total_bytes()`` is then a
precise, auditable statement of what radiation is holding from the card at
any instant.

The layout itself is NOT re-derived here.  ``_SizeOnlyModule`` is handed to
the parent as its array module, so the parent runs its own validation and
its own phase-maximum arithmetic and merely allocates nothing at the end of
it.  There is exactly one transcription of the RRTMGP workspace layout in
this repository and it stays in ``woof.core.preflight``.
