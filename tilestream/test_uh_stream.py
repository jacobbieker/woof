"""UP_HELI_MAX and the two tracker windows, streamed: the RESETS are the bug.

``nwp_diagnostics = 1`` folds a 9-point-smoothed column updraft helicity into
a running max EVERY step (``woof/core/uh_diag.py``), into three separate
window slots that three DIFFERENT consumers zero on three DIFFERENT rhythms:

===========================  =========================  ====================
slot                         reset by                   rhythm
===========================  =========================  ====================
``up_heli_max``              the history writer          every wrfout frame
``uh_follow_window``         the relocation runner       every evaluation
``uh_spawn_window``          the spawn-watch runner      every leg boundary
===========================  =========================  ====================

The FOLD is not the problem.  It is pointwise after a horizontal-radius-1
smooth, so it tiles like any other carrier and needs nothing the halo does not
already carry.  The problem is that every one of those three consumers resets
STATE, not the store::

    reset_up_heli_max(node.state)             woof/runtime.py:2166,2272,2709
    reset_up_heli_max(state)                  woof/prepared_single_domain_forecast.py:4019
    reset_tracker_window(node.parent.state,   woof/core/relocation_runner.py:329
                         UH_FOLLOW_WINDOW_SLOT)
    reset_tracker_window(parent_state,        woof/core/spawn_runner.py:218
                         UH_SPAWN_WINDOW_SLOT)

and under ``[tiles]`` the domain's arrays are in the STORE.  The state the
model still holds -- the one every one of those call sites reaches -- was
copied into that store at ``streaming.attach`` and has been a corpse ever
since.  So the fold lands in the store, the reset lands on the corpse, and
each window silently stops meaning "max since I last looked" and starts
meaning "max since the run began".

That is a wrong forecast with no NaN and no warning, and it biases in ONE
direction: a running max that is never cleared can only ever be too big, so
the tracker and the spawn trigger fire early and never release.  The
monotone-in-one-direction signature is what separates this defect from a
transport error, and this gate asserts it in the negative control rather than
describing it.

It is also INVISIBLE in a short run.  A run that never crosses a reset
boundary is bit-exact either way -- which is the same shape as the three false
results this project has already produced, all three of them numbers measured
in a window where the cadence under test never fired.  So this gate PRINTS the
number of resets each accumulator actually took, on BOTH sides, and refuses
its own result if that number is below three.

    python -m tilestream.test_uh_stream           # the whole gate
    python -m tilestream.test_uh_stream --quick   # the dry rung only

THE SECOND DEFECT, WHICH THE FIRST ONE HIDES
--------------------------------------------
``tilestream.physics_inventory.carrier_manifest`` -- the streaming carrier set
-- is ``woof/io/restart.py``'s manifest, deliberately, so that a field added
to woof tomorrow is streamed the day it is added.  But restart classifies a
scratch slot by whether it is CHECKPOINTED, and the tracker windows are
deliberately not: a window means "max since that consumer last looked" and a
checkpoint cannot know when the consumer will next look.  Having only
``serialize``/``rebuild`` to say that in, they were filed ``rebuild`` -- and
the transport reads ``rebuild`` as "not cross-step state", so it neither
gathers nor scatters them.  Under a host store they were never in the store at
all: each tile buffer accumulated its own window over whatever tiles that
buffer happened to serve, at that buffer's coordinates, and the domain had no
window anywhere.

The two questions -- "does this survive a checkpoint" and "is this cross-step
state a tile buffer must not lose" -- are different questions, and one
classification was answering both.  ``restart.CARRIED_SCRATCH_SLOTS`` is the
third answer; ``streamed_windows_are_carriers`` below is the control that
fails when it is taken away.
