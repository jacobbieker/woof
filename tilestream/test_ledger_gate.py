"""The memory ledger, audited against streaming -- with the controls.

Every capability here is checked twice: once for the answer, once for a
control that fails if the thing under test were switched off or quietly
broken.  A refusal that fires on everything proves nothing, and an equality
that would hold no matter what the code did proves less.

the estimate is mode-blind       priced with mode on and off; the bytes
                                 must be EQUAL, so a later "streaming-aware
                                 estimate" cannot land unnoticed
the drift guard is mode-blind    the three guard quantities, priced both

                                 fire *because of* streaming, and equally
                                 cannot protect a streamed run

                                 ``'off'`` and ``'auto'`` must not, or the
                                 refusal is a blanket one and proves nothing

the receipt names the mode       ``off`` must produce an EMPTY entry (the
                                 pre-streaming receipt, byte for byte), and
                                 ``on`` must produce a non-empty one

CPU only.  Nothing here needs a card; every quantity is shape arithmetic.
The one leg that DOES need a card -- allocating the shared workspaces and
running the drift guard's three comparisons against them, with a negative
control that prices one tree and allocates for another -- lives in
``python -m tilestream.ledger_probe --guard``, because a comparison of two
numbers neither of which touched a device proves the arithmetic and nothing
else.  MEASURED there on an RTX 5090, real74 four-domain tree: arena
3.0876 = 3.0876 GiB, rebuilt 1.9198 = 1.9198, rrtmgp 1.9105 = 1.9105,
resident AND streamed; the negative control (d04 32 cells wider than the
tree that was priced) fired on two of the three legs.

    ``woof go``'s whole design principle is that a refusal belongs on THIS
    side of the fetch: the memory gate and the geography gate both run before
    the download, because the alternative is spending the user's bandwidth on
    forcing data for a run that cannot happen.  A ``[tiles]`` shape no stage
    can honour is the same kind of refusal and sits beside them.

    REWRITTEN FOR 2.5.0, and the refusal this used to assert is why.  It
    demanded ``plan_from_config`` refuse ``mode = "on"`` outright, quoting
    "wires no streamed-domain builder" -- a statement about the route that
    stopped being true when both prepared runners wired
    ``streaming.builders_for_tree``: the authority stage carries a config's
    ``[tiles]`` table into the hash-bound experiment.toml byte for byte,
    the forecast stage reads it and streams, and ``go``'s memory gate
    prices the streamed envelope.  Re-adding that refusal would reject a
    config the chain demonstrably runs (MEASURED 2026-08-16: a real
    ``woof go`` with ``[tiles] mode = "on"``, single 12 km domain,
    report.json tiles decision STREAM), with a message asserting a
    breakage that does not exist -- it would fail exactly when the product
    is fixed; the 2.2.0 admission-gate incident
    (tests/test_streamed_admission.py) is the ruling on which way the
    admission verdict goes.

    What WAS still wrong is the silence: the plan recorded nothing about
    ``[tiles]``, so ``go`` planned six commands that never said the run
    would stream, and the only evidence was one line five stages in, on a
    captured stdout.  So the contract now pinned is four-sided:

    * the CONTROL -- the same config without the block -- plans cleanly
      and records nothing (``plan["tiles"] is None``), or this test would
      pass against a plan that annotated everything;
    * ``mode = "on"`` on the single-domain chain PLANS, to the same
      runner, and the plan records the routing where the banner and the
      dry run read it -- honored visibly, not silently;
    * a ``[tiles]`` table no stage could honour -- an invalid mode -- is
      still REFUSED on this side of the download, as a ``GoRefusal``
      naming the table, not a traceback after a 160 MiB fetch;
    * a stationary tree preserves both requested streamed endpoints on
      ordinary planning call, before the fetch.
