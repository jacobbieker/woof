"""Run one real HRRR-initialised outbreak case, monolithic or streamed.

``--mode monolithic`` is the reference: one resident ``DomainState``, the same
frame boundary imposed after every step, and it is what a card large enough
for the domain would do.  ``--mode streamed`` runs the identical case through
``tilestream.driver.run_tiled`` from a pinned host store, which is the point:
the domain does not fit.

Both modes write the same history files, so a figure cannot tell you which
produced it and a digest can.

    # run carries no reflectivity at all -- the primary field a forecaster
    # reads.  The wrapper turns it on for EVERY step and clears the handoff
    # immediately; the array itself is state-owned ``refl_10cm`` scratch, so
    # it is already part of the streamed carrier set and rides the gather and
    # the scatter like any other field.  ``run_tiled`` binds ``step`` from

    # t=0 is SHORTER than one taken after a step: the microphysics
    # precipitation accumulators, the effective-radii diagnostics and (with
    # Kain-Fritsch) ``cumulus/w0avg`` are allocated on first use.  A tile
    # buffer runs a one-step warmup for exactly that reason, so a store built
    # from an un-stepped domain state is missing fields the buffer holds and
    # the scatter fails.
    #
    # The obvious fix -- step the domain once -- is the one thing this lane
    # cannot do.  A monolithic step needs the dycore's own scratch on top of
    # the state, and at 1200x900x49 that is what does not fit: MEASURED, the
    # ingest alone leaves 2.49 GiB free on a 24 GiB card and the first
    # ``dycore.step`` dies in ``_prepare_atmosphere`` allocating 212 MB.

    # 10), and the elevation-corrected deep-soil boundary does not change it

    # come back in as input, the surface fluxes go non-finite with them, and

    # down over sixteen mountain columns 1 500 km from the storms the case
    # is about.

    #     quietly papering over a spreading instability.
