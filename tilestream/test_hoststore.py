"""Gates for :mod:`tilestream.hoststore`.

Run with::

    python -m tilestream.test_hoststore       # from the repository root

Five gates, in the order they matter:

1.  SHAPES AND STAGGERING, field by field, against a real ``DomainState`` of
    the same config -- including the moist ``mp_physics=10`` inventory, so the
    manifest probe is exercised on more than the dry milestone-one set.
2.  ROUND TRIP: ``fill_from`` then ``to_device_state`` into a *different*
    state must reproduce the source hash exactly, and the store's own
    ``hash()`` must equal ``harness.hash_state`` -- proving the two hashes are
    byte-identical in construction and not merely both self-consistent.
3.  PINNING, asserted per field via ``cudaPointerGetAttributes``.
4.  BANDWIDTH, measured out of the store's own memory at >= 256 MB.
5.  THE BUDGET GUARD refuses an over-large request instead of taking the box
    down.

Every gate prints its evidence.  A speedup with no correctness check is how
this project has been fooled before, so the bandwidth gate runs only after
the round-trip gate has passed on the very same store.

    NOTE ON 232 B/cell.  The project's established footprint says 232 B/cell
    persists.  Measured against the ENFORCED contract set that this store
    actually streams, no configuration reaches that: the heaviest reachable
    inventory (NSSL mp=18 + km_opt=2 + SASE, 31 of the 41 contract names) is
    120.2 B/cell, and milestone one's dry set is 32.2.  All 41 names are
    reachable across configs but no single config allocates more than 31, so
    120.2 is a true ceiling for a single run.  The store is therefore about
    half the assumed size and the achievable domain about twice as large.
    Treat 232 as covering a wider set than STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS (the
    RK-rebuilt copies and physics carriers) -- those are per-step rebuilt or
    scratch, so they stay TILE-sized and never enter the host store.
    ``tilestream.physics_inventory`` has since measured that wider set
    directly: 180.96 B/cell for mp10's full carrier set, 229.29 for
    ``configs/real74_d01.toml``, 291.65 for the heaviest stack that runs.  So
    120.25 bounds what the store holds TODAY, and the 180-292 range is what
    it would hold if the carriers turn out to need streaming too.
