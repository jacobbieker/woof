"""The event chain that lets a sweep's transfers run beside its compute.

:mod:`tilestream.driver` used to issue everything a buffer does -- gather,
ring save, ring patch, step, scatter -- on that buffer's ONE stream.  Inside
a buffer that serialises the copies against the compute by construction, and
the attribution run wrote down what it costs
(``tilestream/OVERLAP-ATTRIBUTION.md``): on the box the build was proven on,
2.3-3.3 s of transfer sat exposed per quiet step, 45% of it at the sweep
seam where the last tiles' scatters drain against an idle GPU and the next
step's first gathers fill against one.

The driver's overlap mode splits each buffer onto three streams -- a copy-in
stream (H2D: geography, boundary tables, carrier gather, ring patch), the
compute stream, and a copy-out stream (D2H: ring save, scatter) -- so the
copy engines and the SMs each have their own queue.  What made the single
stream CORRECT was its program order; take that away and every ordering the
ring scheme needs has to be stated as an event.  This module owns that
statement, in two halves:

* the STRUCTURAL edges, fixed per tile and independent of the plan.  The
  driver enforces these with one event per (tile, operation) class:

  - gather -> save (the save reads window cells the gather writes)
  - gather -> patch (same stream, program order: both write window cells)
  - save -> step (the step overwrites the band the save is reading out)
  - patch -> step (the step reads the cells the patch restores)
  - step -> scatter (the scatter copies the interior the step wrote), with
    the observer / health / post-step hooks recorded BEHIND the step event
    so a hook that reads the buffer is ordered ahead of the scatter too
  - scatter -> the buffer's next gather (the gather overwrites the window
    the scatter is still reading)

* the PLAN-SHAPED edges, which depend on which rectangles actually
  intersect and are the reason this is a module and not four lines in the
  driver.  :class:`OverlapSchedule` computes them from a
  :class:`tilestream.rings.RingPlan`; the driver waits on exactly these
  lists and nothing else.

THE FOUR PLAN-SHAPED HAZARDS, one list each
-------------------------------------------
``patch_waits[j]`` -- RAW on the arena, within a sweep.  patch(j) reads
bands that save(k), k < j, wrote.  This is :attr:`RingPlan.patch_deps`
verbatim; it moves here so the driver has one place to take every wait
from.  Under the single-stream loop the same-buffer case was ordered for
free and skipped; save and patch now sit on DIFFERENT streams even when the
tiles share a buffer, so no case is skipped.

``scatter_waits[k]`` -- WAR on the store, within a sweep.  gather(j),
j < k, reads store cells that scatter(k) overwrites, and there is no patch
in that direction.  :attr:`RingPlan.war_deps` verbatim, waited on the
gather-complete event.

``gather_seam_waits[j]`` -- RAW on the store, ACROSS the sweep seam.
Within one sweep a gather may race an earlier tile's scatter because the
patch overwrites every byte they can disagree on; across the seam that
argument inverts -- sweep s+1's gather must see sweep s's values, the ring
holds time-s-minus-one, and nothing patches it.  The old loop bought this
ordering with ``deviceSynchronize`` at every sweep's end, which is exactly
the exposed fill/drain the attribution measured.  The event form: tile j's
gather waits on the PREVIOUS recording of the scatter event of every tile
whose writes reach j's window -- ``{j}`` (its own interior) union the
within-sweep lists read in both directions.

``save_seam_waits[j]`` -- WAR on the arena, ACROSS the sweep seam.
save(j) at sweep s+1 refills bands that patch(i) at sweep s is still
reading, for every i whose patch list names tile j.  Waited on the
patch-complete (copy-in ready) event's previous recording.

WHY THE SEAM WAITS MAY LAND ON THE WRONG SWEEP'S RECORDING, AND WHY THAT IS
STILL CORRECT: a CUDA event wait takes the event's most recent RECORDED
snapshot at issue time.  The driver issues sweeps in host program order, so
when tile j's gather at sweep s+1 waits on scatter(k): if k has not yet
been re-issued this sweep the snapshot is sweep s's scatter -- the exact
dependency; if k < j has already been re-issued, the snapshot is sweep
s+1's own scatter of k, which FOLLOWS sweep s's on the same stream --
strictly later, so the wait is conservative, never early.  An event that
has never been recorded satisfies the wait immediately, which is the first
sweep's correct answer: there is nothing to wait for, and the driver's
construction-time ``deviceSynchronize`` already fenced the store fill.

:func:`assert_schedule_covers_hazards` re-derives every intersection from
the plan's own gather/scatter rectangles -- the same independence
discipline as :func:`tilestream.rings.assert_ring_covers_reads` -- and
refuses a schedule with a missing edge.  The driver runs it at construction
for ``overlap="on"``, so a hand-edited or regressed dependency list is a
refusal at setup, not a plausible forecast.  ``overlap="unchained"`` skips
the checker and the waits both: it is the negative control that shows the
chain is essential, exactly as ``ring_ordering="submission"`` and
``write_mode="inplace"`` are kept to show for their own orderings.

What is deliberately NOT here: ``_advance_clock`` and
``set_carrier_scalars``.  The attribution run measured both below
0.02 ms/step -- they read and write host-side counters that the step's own
host code maintains synchronously at issue time -- so they need no event
and removing "their" synchronization would be optimizing the noise floor.
