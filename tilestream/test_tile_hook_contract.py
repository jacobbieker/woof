"""The ``tile_hook`` contract, checked without a GPU and without a real case.

THE CONSOLIDATED GATE CANNOT COVER THIS SEAM.  ``tile_hook`` exists for LATERAL
BOUNDARIES -- the one per-tile input the array transport cannot express -- and
the gate lane is periodic by design, so no gate configuration binds a boundary
and nothing in the gate ever calls the hook.  ``tilestream.test_gate`` was
233 PASS / 0 FAIL for the whole period in which every real-case streamed run
died at its first tile change with

    TypeError: bind() takes 3 positional arguments but 4 were given

because the merged 8x4090 driver moved the contract from
``(tile_state, itile, spec)`` to ``(tile_state, tspec, itile, stream)`` -- arity
AND positional order, ``itile`` going from second to third -- and the only
implementation, :func:`tilestream.realcase.tile_boundary_binder`, was not moved
with it.  What let that through review is that ``driver.py`` stated the contract
TWICE and the two disagreed: the new form beside the call site, the old form in
the docstring that names the binder as its user.

So these tests check the two sides against each other rather than against a
restatement of either:

* :func:`test_driver_call_site_passes_the_documented_four` reads the actual call
  out of ``driver.py`` with :mod:`ast`.
* :func:`test_bind_accepts_the_driver_call_site` and
  :func:`test_bind_takes_the_tile_index_from_the_third_position` drive the REAL
  ``bind`` closure over stub boundaries.  Order is tested, not just arity: a
  callback that accepted four arguments and still read ``itile`` from position
  two would serve every tile its neighbour's boundary, silently.
* :func:`test_no_stale_statement_of_the_contract_survives` fails on the
  second, contradicting docstring that caused this.

numpy only, no GPU, no cupy: the stubbed ``woof.ingest.lateral_bc`` keeps the
attach call out of the picture, which is the only thing in the binder that
needs a device.

Run with ``pytest tilestream/test_tile_hook_contract.py`` or directly with
``python tilestream/test_tile_hook_contract.py``.
