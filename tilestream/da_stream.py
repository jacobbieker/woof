"""The DA/ensemble lane against a streamed domain: what tiles, what cannot.

``woof.da.perturb`` and ``woof.da.letkf`` were written for a domain that
fits on the card.  ``tilestream`` exists for one that does not.  Nothing in
either lane mentions the other -- ``grep -rn 'perturb\\|letkf' tilestream/``
and ``grep -rn 'streaming\\|hoststore' woof/da/`` are both empty -- so the
question "does DA work with streaming on" has never had an implementation to
be true or false about.  This module is that implementation, plus the
controls that say which half of it is a design decision and which half is a
law.

THE LAW: AN FFT IS A GLOBAL TRANSFORM
-------------------------------------
``perturb.gaussian_random_field`` draws unit white noise and multiplies its
``rfftn`` by a separable Gaussian amplitude filter.  A per-tile FFT of a
windowed field is NOT the window of the domain FFT, at ANY halo width, and
that is not a halo-tuning problem: the filter's impulse response is
``exp(-r^2/L^2)`` with unbounded support, and the transform of a window is
the domain spectrum CONVOLVED with the window's own transform.  Widening the
halo shrinks the error but never removes it, and the leftover lives exactly
where a reviewer will not look for it -- as a smooth, plausible-looking
noise field with a scale discontinuity at every tile seam.
:func:`tile_filter_control` measures it.

THE DESIGN DECISION: THE DRAW ALREADY HAPPENS ON THE HOST
---------------------------------------------------------
``perturb._white_noise`` runs NumPy's Philox on the HOST even when the
filtering will run on the GPU, precisely so ``noise_sha256`` identifies the
perturbation and not the machine.  So the escape hatch is already half
built: keep the FILTER on the host too and the whole draw is a host-side
operation over the pinned store, which never touches a tile and therefore
never meets the law above.  What was missing was (a) something that lets
``apply_perturbations`` see a store at all, and (b) a way to make the
resident arm agree with it bit for bit -- because ``perturb``'s own
docstring admits "cuFFT and pocketfft round differently".  Both are in this
module and in ``perturb.PerturbationConfig.fft_host``.

WHAT LETKF IS, WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE SHAPE
------------------------------------------
``letkf.analyze`` is pointwise under Gaspari-Cohn localisation: a gridpoint's
analysis reads only observations inside its cutoff.  It is therefore
chunkable, and it already chunks (``chunk_points_for_budget``).  Its problem
is not structure but the LEDGER: the prior is ``R`` times the whole domain,
``_validate_prior`` materialises it with ``xp.asarray(..., float64)``, and
the mean/perturbation step allocates ``xb`` and ``increments`` on top --
three full-domain float64 copies per field per member before a single solve.
:func:`letkf_ledger` measures the multiplier and extrapolates it, because
pinned pages cannot be swapped and this project has already frozen a machine
by guessing.


THE MEASUREMENTS, SO THE TWO SHAPES CAN BE READ SIDE BY SIDE
------------------------------------------------------------
All at 192x160x49, 8 members, ``length_scale_km = 6`` (12 cells), the
streaming lane's own halo 16 = ``harness.halo_radius``.  Run
``python -m tilestream.test_da_stream``.

*The FFT does not tile.*  The same white noise filtered per 48x40 tile
differs from the domain filter by ``8.3e-2`` relative, RMS ``7.2e-3``, and
the error is ``83.6x`` concentrated on the tile seams.  Widening the halo
buys a Gaussian decay and nothing else -- ``5.7e-3`` at 24, ``2.1e-4`` at
32, ``2.3e-8`` at 48 -- and only reaches float64 rounding at halo 80, whose
window is 200x208 on a 160x192 domain.  A window that covers the domain is
not a tile, and even it is not bit-exact, because a transform of a
differently shaped array is different arithmetic.  Static row decomposition
(the multi-GPU shape) is the same law with a bigger seam ratio: ``5.1e-2``
at 2 ranks, ``6.0e-2`` at 4.

*The analysis does tile, exactly.*  The same 4-slab decomposition run
through :func:`letkf_slab_control` is BIT-IDENTICAL to the monolithic
analysis at halo 2 -- 0 of 12,042,240 values differ -- and differs in 3,360
values by ``1.8e-1`` relative at halo 1.  Halo 2 is not a swept number: it
is ``floor(horizontal_m / dx)`` straight out of ``_horizontal_stencil``,
because Gaspari-Cohn has compact support.  That contrast is the finding:
one operator has a dependency cone and the other has none, and no amount of
halo tuning moves either of them across the line.

    ``_validate_prior`` calls ``xp.asarray(prior[f], dtype=float64)`` on

    ``increments`` -- so THREE full ``(R, nz, ny, nx)`` float64 arrays per
    analysis field exist simultaneously before the chunk loop starts, on top
    of whatever the caller's prior already occupied.  The chunk budget
    (``memory_budget_mib``) bounds the solve's scratch and explicitly not
    this.  Every observation batch adds a fourth ``(R, nz, ny, nx)``
    (``simulated``) plus two ``(nz, ny, nx)``.

    Reported separately from the pinned figure because the two live in

    An ENSEMBLE asks for ``R`` stores, so a host figure read as the
    container's reaches the wall ``R`` times sooner -- and pinned pages
    cannot be swapped, which is how this project already froze a machine.

    limit; this report sets the limit (``cgroup_bytes``, the smallest on the
    process's own cgroup path, read from ``cgroup_path``, and
    ``cgroup_room_bytes``, the least room under any of them) beside the
    uncapped host figure it would otherwise have been.

    THE BREAKAGE: this read only the mount root's ``memory.max``.  Inside a
    systemd scope with ``MemoryMax=2G`` the root carries no limit, so it
    reported none, and the host's 30.55 GiB as the figure to trust.  It now
