"""STREAMED-PARENT NESTING THROUGH THE EXECUTOR, both coupling directions.

Run it::

    python -m tilestream.test_nest_executor              # the whole matrix
    python -m tilestream.test_nest_executor --steps 6    # shorter window

WHAT THIS GATE ADDS OVER THE TWO THAT EXIST
-------------------------------------------
``tilestream/test_nest.py`` proved the COUPLER: ``force()`` and
``feedback_commit()`` driven by hand around a hand-transcribed schedule are
bit-identical streamed vs resident, one-way and two-way.
``tilestream/test_moving_nest.py`` proved the EXECUTOR moves a nest on a
streamed parent -- one-way only, because until now the executor REFUSED
``feedback = 1`` under a streamed parent, in a dispatch no gate drove: the
refusal and the coupler capability it contradicted arrived from different
lanes of the same three-way merge (2358b3c06), and the coupler gate never
goes through ``execute_experiment``.

This gate drives ``woof.core.model.execute_experiment`` -- the product
loop, with its own FORCE/FEEDBACK edge dispatch, its windowed
``sync_to_state`` at FORCE and its clock imposition -- over a static
two-domain tree, and compares whole carrier sets:

``A  resident   fb0``   the control.
``B  resident   fb1``   MUST differ from A in the parent (the treatment
                        proof: an A/B pair whose arms agree proves the
                        experiment never ran, which this project has
                        shipped as a result five times and will not again).
``C  streamed   fb0``   d01 (store) and d02 (state) bit-identical to A.
``D  streamed   fb1``   bit-identical to B.  This is the leg the executor
                        refused before fix(executor); it is the reason this
                        gate exists.
``E  streamed   solo``  d01 alone, no child in the tree, same executor,
                        same schedule cadence.  E's store vs C's store is
                        the #43 proof under streaming: a one-way parent is
                        bitwise unchanged by the presence of its nest.
``N  negative``         C with the store UNPUBLISHED from the parent state
                        and the executor's windowed FORCE projection
                        disarmed -- today's coupler reads ``node.state``
                        raw, exactly the pre-repair code path.  d02 MUST
                        differ from A's, or this gate cannot see the defect
                        it patrols and every PASS above is vacuous.

Same discipline as the sibling gates: exit code 3 means the CARD WAS TAKEN
(a lost allocation race on a shared box is not a measurement), cadence
census printed for BOTH sides of every comparison, digests over the store
for a streamed domain and over the state for a resident one -- comparing a
streamed leg's ``node.state`` would compare the attach-time snapshot and
fail for a reason that has nothing to do with nesting.

THE INITIAL FEEDBACK TRANSACTION IS PART OF THE TREE, NOT THE LOOP
------------------------------------------------------------------
``build_experiment`` runs WRF's ``med_nest_initial`` equivalent -- prepare/
commit/finalize once, clocks equal at t=0 -- when it assembles a
``feedback = 1`` tree (model.py:660-672).  ``assemble_idealized_tree``
does not, so the fb1 legs run it by hand BEFORE the parent is attached to
the streaming transport, which is the same order the product takes: the
initial restriction lands on the resident prepared state, and ``attach``
copies the post-restriction parent into the store.
