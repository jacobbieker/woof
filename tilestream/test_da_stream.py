"""THE DA/ENSEMBLE GATE: does the perturbation and the LETKF survive streaming?

Run it::

    python -m tilestream.test_da_stream

Three execution modes, two legs, and a control for each claim.

  RESIDENT   ``woof.da.perturb.apply_perturbations`` on a CuPy DomainState,
             ``woof.da.letkf.analyze`` on a CuPy prior.  If this fails the
             feature is broken independently of anything the streaming lane
             did, which is itself the finding.
  STREAMED   the same domain in a pinned :class:`tilestream.hoststore
             .HostDomainStore`, addressed through
             :class:`tilestream.da_stream.StoreStateView`.
  MULTI-GPU  static row decomposition.  There is no distributed FFT in this
             tree, so the question is answered by measurement rather than by
             running one: :func:`tilestream.da_stream.slab_filter_control`.

WHY THE DOMAIN IS SMALL ON PURPOSE
----------------------------------
192x160x49, 8 members.  This gate answers EXACTNESS, not throughput, and it
quotes no timing at all: a 192-cell compute window measures an idle GPU, not
the code (see ``tilestream/RESULTS.md``).  Nothing here fires a physics
cadence either, because nothing here steps the model -- the perturbation is
an initialisation and the analysis is an increment, so the radiation/cumulus
cadence trap that has produced three false results in this project does not
apply to this lane.  It DOES apply the moment somebody times a streamed
ensemble forecast, and that measurement is not in this file.

THE FOUR CONTROLS, AND WHAT EACH ONE WOULD CATCH
------------------------------------------------
1.  ``tile_filter_control`` -- the same white noise filtered per 48x40 tile
    with the streaming lane's own halo.  MUST FIRE.  If a per-tile FFT
    reproduced the domain FFT then the whole-domain claim would be empty.
2.  ``fft_host = False`` resident-versus-store -- MUST FIRE.  It is the
    control on the fix: with the filter left on whichever backend the state
    happens to live on, the resident and streamed members of one seed differ,
    and a gate that only ran with the fix on could not tell whether the fix
    did anything.
3.  the store view must be a VIEW.  A copy would perturb a throwaway and
    hand the streamed run its untouched background -- a member that believes
    it was perturbed and was not.  Checked by digesting the store's own
    pinned buffers after the call, not the view.
4.  LETKF with an all-False observation mask -- the closed-form inactive
    transform, which at ``prior_inflation = 1`` is BITWISE zero.  A filter
    that quietly did something on a no-observation cycle would show up here
    and nowhere else.

    >90% of cells at every shape tried).  The state it is added to is
    FLOAT32, whose ULP is eight orders of magnitude wider, so the two
    increments almost always round to the same float32 word and the resident
