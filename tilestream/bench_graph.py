"""What CUDA graph replay is worth to a tiled sweep, as a function of window.

The hypothesis this exists to test, stated before it was run so it could be
refuted: a tiled sweep re-issues the step's kernel launches once per TILE, so
the launch overhead is multiplied by the tile count, and the smaller the
compute window the larger a fraction of the step that overhead is.  If that is
right, replaying the step from a captured graph should be worth little at a
672^2 window and a lot at 224^2 -- and the small windows are exactly what a 12
GB card is forced into, so it would be the fix for the small-card lane rather
than a general speedup.

Run it::

    python -m tilestream.bench_graph --rung "dry (control)" \\
        --domain 1344 --windows 224,288,384,480,544,672 --steps 8

HOW TO READ A NUMBER FROM THIS, AND WHEN NOT TO
-----------------------------------------------
A compute window below roughly 500 cells a side does NOT saturate a modern
card.  Every timing at 224^2 or 288^2 is therefore a measurement of launch and
submission cost with an idle GPU underneath, NOT of the solver's throughput,
and this project has already lost hours to quoting one as if it were the
latter.  That is not a caveat that weakens the result here -- it IS the result.
The graph is worth something precisely because the GPU is idle waiting for the
host, and the number to quote is the RATIO between the two tiled runs at the
same window, never the absolute ms/step of a small window on its own.

WHAT IT MEASURED
----------------
RTX 5070 (12 GB, native Linux, CuPy 14.1.1), verified idle, one buffer, no
gather or scatter, min of 3 x 20 steps.  Two independent runs agree to 0.1%
wherever they overlap.

Dry lane, 232 captured nodes::

    window   stream ms   graph ms   saved   speedup
       128       5.195      4.831   0.364    1.075x

       288      27.015     26.755   0.260    1.010x
       352      40.321     40.127   0.194    1.005x
       448      67.773     67.615   0.159    1.002x
       544     100.638    100.424   0.214    1.002x
       672     152.595    152.386   0.209    1.001x

Ship config ``full(real74) +KF``, 876 captured nodes, radiation 0 and cumulus
0 firings inside the window (production cadence), surface/PBL every step::

    window   stream ms   graph ms   saved   speedup
       128      29.883     25.977   3.907    1.150x
       160      46.350     43.118   3.232    1.075x
       224      85.246     83.579   1.667    1.020x

The shape is the one the hypothesis predicted -- the win is a shrinking
FRACTION as the window grows -- and the magnitude is not.  At the 224 window
where the tiling tax was measured at 5.37x, the graph removes 2% of a dry
tile-step and 2% of a physics one.  Graph capture is a real few-percent
saving on small windows and it is NOT the explanation for the tiling tax.
The absolute saving tracks the number of launches, not the window: 0.2-0.36
ms over 232 nodes is 1.3 us a launch, 3.2-3.9 ms over 876 nodes is 3.7-4.5
us a launch, both in the band PERF-FINDINGS measured for the mechanism, and
both far short of what a 5x would need.

AND THEN THE PLATFORM TURNED OUT TO MATTER MORE THAN THE WINDOW
---------------------------------------------------------------
The same benchmark on an RTX 5090 under WSL2 -- which is the machine
PERF-SURVEY.md profiled and the machine this is being built for -- gives a
completely different magnitude for the same code:

    ship config, 876 nodes (two runs)

                                   288      -/67.90       -/61.55       -/1.10x

    dry, 232 nodes (two runs)      128    4.97/4.07   2.84/2.84  1.75x/1.44x
                                   224   12.83/16.55  7.59/7.66  1.69x/2.16x
                                   352   26.92/29.04 18.42/23.47 1.46x/1.24x
                                   544   46.30/47.36 45.02/45.50 1.03x/1.04x

Native Linux removes 3.7-4.5 us a launch; WSL2 removes 5.9-13.0.  WSL2's
kernel launch goes through a paravirtualised driver and costs several times
what a native one does, and it is the SAME 876 launches either way, so the
same graph is worth three times more there.  Read the two tables together
before quoting either: this is a 2-5% saving on a dedicated Linux card and a
15-95% one on the desktop.

Note also which column is stable.  Across repeats on a shared card the graph
times move by under 1% while the stream times move by 25%, because host
submission cost is what a graph removes and host contention is what makes
submission expensive.  A graph does not only make the step faster on this
platform, it makes it PREDICTABLE.

The second trap is physics cadence.  Radiation and cumulus fire on a cadence
of minutes; a short timed window at production cadence fires them ZERO times
and measures a step that is not the step the forecast runs.  Every row below
therefore prints how many times radiation and cumulus actually fired inside
the timed window, on BOTH sides of the comparison, and the two must agree --
if they do not, the two sides are not the same work and the ratio is
meaningless.
