"""A forecast at a domain the resident path cannot run, start to finish.

Everything else in this package proves that a tile stream reproduces a
monolithic run bit for bit.  That is a claim about ARITHMETIC.  This module
exists to produce the other kind of evidence -- a picture of the atmosphere at
a domain size the monolithic path cannot reach at all -- and it turns out that
needs one piece nothing here had: an INITIAL CONDITION that never exists on
the device.

    ``harness.make_physics_state`` allocates the full domain.  At
    ``full+MYNN+Noah-MP`` that is 275.5 B/cell of carriers plus the dycore
    and physics working set, so the state builder hits the same VRAM wall
    the stepping loop was built to get past.  A streamed forecast whose
    initialisation is monolithic is capped by its initialisation.

So the state here is built ONE ROW SLAB AT A TIME and scattered into the
pinned host store, and the slab build is legitimate only because every step
of the construction is COLUMN-LOCAL.  That is a claim, so
:func:`selftest_slab_build_matches_monolithic` measures it against a
monolithic ``make_physics_state``-shaped build at a size where both fit,
rather than leaving it as an argument.  Two places it would NOT have been
true, and what was done about each:

* the random perturbations.  ``numpy.random.default_rng(seed).
  standard_normal(shape)`` consumes a shape-dependent number of variates, so
  a slab that draws its own noise is not the domain's window of anything.
  The noise is therefore drawn ONCE at full domain shape (:class:`SeededNoise`)
  and windowed, which is also what makes it continuous across slab seams --
  a per-slab draw would put a visible discontinuity every ``slab_rows`` rows
  and it would look exactly like weather.
* the vapour profile.  ``harness.make_physics_state`` seeds ``qv`` off
  ``state.height_half().mean(axis=(1, 2))`` -- a DOMAIN mean, which a slab
  cannot compute.  Here the profile is evaluated on the flat-terrain column
  heights instead, which is a function of ``nz``/``ztop`` alone and therefore
  identical for every slab.  It is a different initial condition from the
  harness's by the amount terrain tilts the mean, and it is the one that
  tiles.

WHAT THE INITIAL CONDITION ACTUALLY IS -- SAY IT ON THE PLOT
------------------------------------------------------------
There is no GRIB in this path and no WPS.  The state is IDEALISED and the
figures must say so.  Specifically:

* the Weisman-Klemp 1982 analytic sounding (``woof.verify.cases.wk82``),
  horizontally uniform -- a severe-storm environment, roughly 2200 J/kg CAPE;
* the WK82 quarter-circle hodograph (WRF ``em_quarter_ss``'s own wind
  columns, shipped in that module), also horizontally uniform, so the domain
  has real vertical shear and storms have something to organise against;
* a 0.1 K boundary-layer theta perturbation to break the symmetry, plus
  3 K warm bubbles -- WK82's own trigger -- so deep convection initiates on
  a schedule a two-hour forecast can show.  NOT ``harness``'s seeding
  amplitudes; see :data:`NOISE_AMPLITUDES` for the measurement that made
  that a deliberate departure;
* a REAL Lambert conformal grid -- map factors, Coriolis and per-column
  latitude/longitude that every solar-zenith path in the tree reads -- and a
  latitude/longitude-anchored terrain ridge;
* full physics: Morrison two-moment, MYNN surface layer + PBL, Noah-MP,
  RTE+RRTMGP and Smagorinsky ``km_opt=4`` -- :data:`RUNG`, the top rung of
  the bit-exact matrix.  Its Kain-Fritsch cumulus scheme is the one piece a
  convection-allowing run should NOT have, and ``--no-cumulus`` turns it
  off: MEASURED at 192^2, dx = 3 km, WK82, t+90 min, KF produces
  accumulated precipitation over 93.7% of the domain (mean 2.75 mm) against
  21.5% for the resolved storms (mean 0.80 mm).  A scheme whose job is
  convection the grid cannot resolve, firing in nearly every column of a
  grid that resolves it, is a scale error and it dominates the picture.
  Turning it off REMOVES 16 carriers (229 -> 213) and 48.3 B/cell, so the
  resident-ceiling claim must be re-measured at whichever of the two is
  actually run -- ``run_bigdomain ceiling`` takes the same flag for exactly
  that reason.

What that is NOT is a weather map.  A horizontally uniform sounding has no
fronts, no jet, no dryline and no synoptic pattern, and nothing here should
be described as a forecast of any real day.  What it does have is real
convective overturning on a real projection, and that is what the figures
claim.

THE LATERAL BOUNDARY, MEASURED RATHER THAN CHOSEN
-------------------------------------------------
The brief for this work asked for specified boundaries.  Measured on this
tree, they are not available to the streaming path yet, and the reason is
structural rather than a missing switch:

``specified``
    ``dycore.step`` refuses outright -- ``cfg.specified=True requires
    attach_lateral_boundaries(state, ...)``.  Those tables are attached to
    the STATE and appear in neither
    :func:`tilestream.physics_inventory.carrier_manifest` nor
    :func:`tilestream.driver.geography_inventory`, so a tile holding a true
    domain edge has no way to receive its window of the boundary frame.
    Wiring them is a real piece of work, not a keyword.
``open`` (radiative)
    needs no table, but ``h_sca_adv_order=5`` is explicitly unwired for it
    (``dycore.py:405``), so it costs the 5th-order geopotential advection,
    and no gate row has ever tiled a non-periodic domain.
``periodic``
    what all 14 physics rungs of ``test_gate`` certify bit-exact, and what
    this module runs.  Its cost is accurate and worth stating: on a real
    Lambert grid the index wrap is a GEOGRAPHIC discontinuity -- latitude,
    Coriolis and the solar zenith all jump across it -- so the outermost few
    rows and columns are not physical and the figures crop them.

#: ``full + MYNN + Noah-MP``: the top rung of the bit-exact matrix, copied

#: THE RUNG HAS NO DAMPING, AND A FORECAST NEEDS SOME.  Found the hard way.
#:
#: ``RunConfig`` defaults ``w_damping = 0`` (config.py:84) and
#: ``damp_opt = 0`` (:48), and :data:`RUNG` -- copied from the bit-exact
#: matrix -- overrides neither, because the gate runs 1 to 8 steps and a
#: state that has been stepped eight times has no convection in it.  A
#: FORECAST does.  MEASURED, 1440^2 at dx = 3 km, dt = 15 s: the run reached
#: t+45 min cleanly with 346 cells above 30 m/s and a peak column-max w of
#: 44.8 m/s, and then died between t+45 and t+60 with
#:
#:     ValueError: MYNN mass-flux inputs must be finite
#:      (mynn_pbl_gpu.py:1148, via dycore.step -> physics.compute)
#:
#: i.e. a non-finite value reached the PBL scheme.  With 49 levels to a
#: 20 km top the mid-tropospheric layer is roughly 400 m, so 44.8 m/s at
#: dt = 15 s is a VERTICAL Courant number near 1.7 -- exactly the regime
#: WRF's ``w_damping = 1`` exists to hold, and it was off.
#:
#: The failure is in the CONFIGURATION, not in the streaming path: the state
#: at t+45 is finite everywhere, the tiled loop is bit-exact against a
#: monolithic run of this same configuration, and nothing about the geometry
#: of the tiles enters the vertical Courant number.  Before this rung is used
#: for a multi-hour forecast it wants ``w_damping=1`` and a
#: ``damp_opt=3``/``zdamp``/``dampcoef`` upper damping layer -- and no
#: bit-exactness gate will ever ask for them, which is the point worth
#: recording.
DAMPING_NOTE = ("w_damping=0 and damp_opt=0 are RunConfig defaults and this "

#: (``dt <= 6 * dx_km``).  ``harness.GEOGRAPHY_OVERRIDES`` carries 12 km,

#: Earth, and the Lambert grid would run off the pole.
DX = 3000.0
DT = 15.0

#: Nominal forecast start.  Late April, 18 UTC: mid-afternoon over the

#: Perturbation amplitudes for a FORECAST, which are not the harness's.
#:
#: ``harness._SEED_FIELDS`` seeds 0.5 K of white noise in theta, 20% white
#: noise in vapour and 20 Pa in the column mass, at EVERY cell.  Those
#: amplitudes exist to make a bit-exactness gate sensitive -- a hash test
#: wants every field excited -- and they are actively wrong for a forecast on
#: an unstable sounding.  MEASURED at 192^2, dx = 3 km, WK82: with the gate
#: amplitudes the composite reflectivity field at t+15 min is salt-and-pepper
#: at the GRID SCALE, isolated cells at 55-65 dBZ with no coherent
#: structure, because 20% white noise in qv saturates individual columns and
#: 0.5 K white noise gives each of them its own LFC.  It is noise being
#: amplified by real convective instability, and it looks like a broken
#: model.
#:
#: So the noise here does one job -- break the symmetry of a horizontally
#: uniform sounding so the bubbles are not the only thing in the domain --
#: and the trigger is the WK82 thermal, as in the case this sounding comes

    """Column-maximum REFL_10CM (dBZ), computed out of core, WOOF's own way.

    ``woof.core.refl.compute_refl_10cm`` is the model's diagnostic and this
    calls it -- it is not re-derived here.  What is arranged here is only
    that it can be called at all on a domain that does not fit: reflectivity
    is COLUMN-LOCAL (Morrison's ``refl10cm_hm`` walks one column of
    ``qr/nr/qs/ns/qg/ng`` against ``t``/``p`` and nothing else), so a slab
    with no halo whatsoever gives exactly the answer the whole domain would.
    That is why this can use bare row slabs while the stepping loop needs a
    16-cell halo.

    It is the STANDALONE-current-state path, not the microphysics-time one:
    ``compute_refl_10cm`` is handed no explicit ``temperature``/``pressure``
    and so forms ``T = (thb + thp) * (p / p0)^(Rd/cp)`` from the state in
    hand.  Production history output passes the scheme's post-call T and the
    prepared p instead (PROVENANCE.md D2).  The difference is one
    microphysics call's worth of temperature and it is named here so nobody
    reports this as the history-step field.

    The column max is the standard composite: ``woof/render.py`` takes
    exactly ``REFL_10CM.max(axis=vertical)`` for its composite product.

    THE SCHEME'S OWN FIELD WINS, exactly as it does for the streamed real
    case -- and ``refl_stash`` is what says there is one to win with.  This
    lane's store carries ``scratch/refl_10cm`` from the manifest onwards
    (:func:`carrier_manifest_for`), but it starts EMPTY: no slab computes
    reflectivity while the store is being built, and the slot holds a field
    only once a sweep carrying ``refl_10cm_due`` has written every tile's
    window into it.  So the caller says which it has:

    ``"computed"``
        a sweep configured by :func:`tilestream.driver
        .reflectivity_run_kwargs` has run, and that array IS the model's
        reflectivity -- the only route for mp=9, 18 and 50, whose dBZ is
        produced inside the scheme call and published through no operator,
        and the only correct route for mp=8 and 28, whose operator branch
        needs a graupel-number shadow that is rebuilt and never serialised.
    ``"absent"`` (the default) or ``"primed"``
        the slab recompute below, because zeros rendered as dBZ are a
        domain-wide 0 dBZ field that reads like weak echo rather than like
        a field nothing has written.

    The species the recompute reads come from
    ``woof.core.refl.REFL_10CM_INPUT_SPECIES`` -- audit R-052: the tuple
    that used to be typed here was Morrison's six-moment set, duplicated
    from the real-case lane, so every other scheme was refused for lacking
    a moment its reflectivity formulation never reads.
