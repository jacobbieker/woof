"""One workspace for every tile buffer, instead of one per tile buffer.

MEASURED FIRST, THEN BUILT
--------------------------
:mod:`tilestream.vram_probe` armed a live allocation ledger over the whole
life of a full+MYNN+Noah-MP buffer at 128x128x49 and then built three
identical buffers in one process.  The result is the fact this module exists
to act on:

  ==========================  ============  ==================================
  buffer                      pooled bytes  what it paid for
  ==========================  ============  ==================================
  1                           1,299.7 MiB   everything
  2                           1,276.6 MiB   everything except 22.65 MiB
  3                           1,276.6 MiB   everything except 22.65 MiB
  ==========================  ============  ==================================

**98.2% of a tile buffer's device footprint is paid again for every
buffer.**  The only per-PROCESS item in the whole configuration is the
22.65 MiB of RRTMGP k-distribution and cloud-optics tables, which
``functools.lru_cache`` already shares.  Nothing else was shared with
anything.

And the largest single item does not shrink with the tile.  MYNN's declared
workspace is sized against ``MYNN_PBL_COLUMN_CHUNK``, not against ``ny*nx``:
52,352 bytes per column at ``nz = 49``, a fixed figure for every tile at or
above the width.  The measurement below was taken while that width was
16,384 columns -- 818.0 MiB, which a 128x128 tile exactly reaches.  Of the
907.2 MiB of arena-eligible scratch a 128x128 tile declares, 836.4 MiB is
MYNN's.  A second buffer therefore costs another 818 MiB of fixed workspace
before it holds a single cell of weather, and on a 12 GB card that is 6.7% of
the whole device per buffer, for a scheme that is running on exactly one
buffer at a time.  Since the 2026-09-15 sweeps the width ships at 8,192
columns and that item is 409.0 MiB, which halves the number without changing
what it is: the largest single one, and paid per buffer.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES
---------------------
woof already solved this problem for a different caller.
:class:`woof.core.state.ScratchArena` exists so that the four domains of a
nested tree can share one backing for every step-local scratch slot, and
:mod:`woof.core.preflight` carries the reviewed lifetime audit that decides
which slots may join (``write_before_read`` only -- carrying slots such as
the ``mp_*`` precipitation accumulators and Kain-Fritsch's ``cu_*`` are
excluded by name).  ``SharedDycoreStateWorkspace`` does the same for the
restart-REBUILT state symbols and ``SharedRRTMGPChunkWorkspace`` for the
radiation solver's per-chunk live set.

Tile buffers are the same shape of problem as sibling domains: they hold
different data, they step one at a time, and their scratch is dead between
steps.  So this module builds those three objects ONCE from the tile config
and hands the same three to every buffer.  It adds no new sharing mechanism
and no new lifetime claim; it applies woof's own, and the gate proves the
result is bit-identical.

THE CONDITION THAT MAKES IT LEGAL, AND WHY IT WAS NOT TRUE
----------------------------------------------------------
"They step one at a time" is a claim about the DEVICE, not about the Python
loop, and in ``driver.run_tiled`` it was FALSE.  Each buffer owns a
non-blocking stream and tile *i*'s ``step`` is enqueued on stream
``i % nbuffers`` with nothing ordering it against tile *i+1*'s ``step`` on
the next stream.  The two computations are independent by construction --
that is the whole point of the multi-buffer pipeline -- so the driver may run
them concurrently, and two concurrent steps sharing one scratch arena would
be writing the same bytes.

``run_tiled(share=...)`` therefore also CHAINS THE COMPUTE: an event is
recorded after each tile's ``step`` and the next tile's stream waits on it.
Copies are untouched, so the prefetch pipeline still hides the transfer
behind the compute -- only compute/compute overlap is given up, and
``tilestream.vram_share_bench`` measures what that costs.

``chain_compute=False`` is the negative control and it is not decorative: it
shares the arena WITHOUT the chain, which is precisely "the reclaimed buffer
is reused while it is still live".  On a dry 192x192 domain split 3x3 it
makes ALL NINE carriers differ, three runs out of three, while the same
configuration with the chain on is bit-exact -- ``tilestream/test_share.py``
asserts both.

WHAT IT IS WORTH, MEASURED
--------------------------
Three buffers of an 80x72x49 tile (the gathered extent of a 48x40 tile at
halo 16), full+MYNN+Noah-MP, marginal pooled bytes per buffer:

  ==================================  =========  =========  =========
  configuration                       buffer 1   buffer 2   buffer 3
  ==================================  =========  =========  =========
  private workspaces (as shipped)     472.1 MiB  449.0 MiB  449.0 MiB
  shared, RRTMGP chunk 3125           100.6 MiB  100.6 MiB  100.6 MiB
  shared, RRTMGP chunk 1024           100.6 MiB  100.6 MiB  100.6 MiB
  ==================================  =========  =========  =========

The marginal cost of a buffer falls 4.5x, from 449.0 to 100.6 MiB.  Against
that, one shared allocation of 1,185.1 MiB (624.0 MiB at RRTMGP chunk 1024)
is paid once.  Counting what the DEVICE actually holds -- pool_total, which
includes the blocks the pool retained after radiation freed them -- three
buffers cost 2,100 MiB private, 1,548 MiB shared, and 992 MiB shared at
chunk 1024: 2.1x less.

The shared allocation is eager and complete while ``DomainState.scratch`` is
lazy and partial, so at ``nbuffers == 1`` this is a wash and not a win.
Sharing is worth exactly what a second buffer would have cost.

WHAT IT BUYS ON A 12 GB CARD
----------------------------
Largest square extent at ``nz = 49``, full+MYNN+Noah-MP, that survives two
steps INCLUDING a forced radiation firing at the production 12-minute
cadence.  Bisected one fresh subprocess per trial on an idle RTX 4090 with
the CuPy pool capped at 9.740 GiB -- a 5070's 11.940 GiB total minus the
2.06-2.18 GiB of measured non-pool footprint (CUDA context + NVRTC module
images), which no pool-only accounting counts and which a 12 GB card pays
first.  Every refusal in the sweep cited the pool cap, so no row is a
disguised device-level OOM:

  ===========================================  ==========  ==========
  configuration                                  extent      Mcell
  ===========================================  ==========  ==========
  ONE RESIDENT DOMAIN (the vanilla ceiling)
    as shipped                                     464^2        10.5
    + shared workspaces                            464^2        10.5
    + RRTMGP column_chunk 1024                     480^2        11.3
    + MYNN column chunk 4096                       496^2        12.1
  ONE STREAMED TILE, nbuffers = 2
    as shipped                                     336^2         5.5
    + everything above                             416^2         8.5
  ===========================================  ==========  ==========

The streamed row is the one that matters: the shipped configuration cannot
double-buffer a tile bigger than 336x336 on a 12 GB card, and with the
reclamations it reaches 416x416 -- 1.53x the cells per tile, from the same
device.  A bigger tile is not a bigger domain (the domain lives in host RAM);
it is less halo redundancy per cell and fewer tiles per sweep.
