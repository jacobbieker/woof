"""Restart round-trip for a STREAMED run: write from pinned host RAM, read back.

A forecast that cannot be restarted cannot be operated, and nothing in this
project had ever written a restart from a streamed run.  ``woof.io.restart``
can only be handed a live ``DomainState`` -- it walks ``vars(state)``, reaches
``state._scratch`` and ``state.physics``, and pulls every one of those arrays
to the host with ``value.get()``.  A streamed domain HAS no such state: that is
the entire point of the out-of-core lane, and at the sizes it exists for the
monolithic device state is exactly the thing that does not fit.  So this module
writes the same file from the pinned host store instead, with no device
allocation of any kind, and reads it back into a pinned host store the same
way.


THE THREE INVENTORIES, RECONCILED
---------------------------------
The brief for this work warned that ``woof/io/restart.py`` keeps "its own
ENFORCED carrier manifest, separate from the 41-name STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS
contract", and that the streamed inventory is a third list of 229 names --
three lists that must be reconciled or a restart silently drops state.

MEASURED, at ``full+MYNN+Noah-MP``, 40x32x49, one step in (the count matters:
Kain-Fritsch allocates ``cumulus/w0avg`` lazily on its first call):

==========================================  =======  ==================
inventory                                   members  relation
==========================================  =======  ==================
``STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS``                       41  25 allocated here
``restart``: state+scratch+driver manifest      229  the restart file
``physics_inventory.carrier_manifest``          229  IDENTICAL, same
                                                     array objects
==========================================  =======  ==================

A FOURTH SET APPEARED LATER, and it is narrower than all of these: what may
go in the FILE.  ``restart.CARRIED_SCRATCH_SLOTS`` is cross-step state that
is deliberately not checkpointed -- the two ``nwp_diagnostics`` tracker
windows. Ordinary checkpoints omit them and restore resets them; a tree
with a lifecycle explicitly opts its allocated tracker windows in through the same
resident-writer contract. Those windows retain the consumer's consultation
history. The underlying streaming inventory and ordinary checkpoint set
are unchanged.

Two of the three are not two.  :func:`tilestream.physics_inventory.
carrier_manifest` does not maintain a list at all -- it CALLS
``restart.state_manifest``, ``restart._scratch_manifest`` and
``restart._driver_manifest`` and merges them.  Set-equal, and
``rman[k] is cman[k]`` for all 229 keys: the same objects, not copies.
:func:`reconcile_inventories` re-measures that on every run rather than
trusting this paragraph, and it is a gate row.

The list that really is separate is the 41-name contract, and it is separate
because it is a DIFFERENT THING: it enumerates ``DomainState`` attributes, not
restart members.  At this rung it covers 25 of the 229 members -- 34.4% of the
carrier bytes -- and the other 204 live in ``state._scratch`` (17),
``state.physics`` (24 driver + 162 surface/soil/snow ``fields``) and on the
scheme objects (``cumulus/w0avg``).  The 16 contract names with no member are
absent or ``None`` under this configuration (``tke``, the NSSL and Thompson
moments, ``e_sgs``), which the writer and reader both skip on purpose.

That asymmetry is a live trap, not a historical one:
:class:`tilestream.hoststore.HostDomainStore` DEFAULTS to
``attrs=STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS``.  A store built that way and handed to a
restart writer would produce a file holding 25 of 229 members that passes
every shape check in ``woof/io/restart.py`` -- because those checks validate
the file against ITSELF (``array_manifest`` vs members) and against the
resuming state, and a resuming state has all 229 slots already allocated by
preparation.  So :func:`write_streamed_restart` refuses a store whose key set
is not exactly the restart manifest, and says which names are missing.


WHAT THE HEADER NEEDS THAT A HOST STORE DOES NOT HAVE
-----------------------------------------------------
The arrays are the easy half.  ``restart``'s header also carries two
fingerprints that a resuming run is validated against, and neither is
computable from the carriers:

``setup_fingerprint(state)``
    SHA-256 over ``STATE_SETUP_ARRAYS`` + ``STATE_SETUP_SCALARS`` + the
    attached LBC tables.  These are the DOMAIN's geography -- which the
    streaming lane already holds in host RAM as
    :func:`tilestream.driver.geography_inventory`, because a tile has to
    gather it -- plus the purely vertical arrays (``c1h``..``znw``, ``dnw``,
    ``fnp``...) that the geography inventory deliberately omits because a tile
    REBUILDS them exactly from ``nz``/``hybrid_opt``/``etac``/``p_top``.

``physics_setup_identity(state, cfg)``
    Resolved scheme identities, cadences, coefficient-table digests -- and,
    critically, ``_array_setup_identity`` of the radiation callable's
    ``latitude_deg``/``longitude_deg``.  On a tile buffer those hold the LAST
    TILE's window.  Hash them and the restart claims a physics setup no
    resuming domain will ever reproduce.

So :class:`DomainSetup` is the third thing a streamed restart needs alongside
the store and the clock, and :func:`domain_setup_from_stream` builds it out of
what a streamed run already has: the domain geography store for everything
horizontal, a tile buffer for everything vertical, and
:func:`tilestream.driver.geography_scalars` for ``has_msf``/``rotational``
(which ``state.py:799-803`` derives from ``.any()`` over whatever window it
was handed, so a tile's answer is not the domain's).  The claim that the
vertical half may be taken from a tile is CHECKED, not assumed:
:func:`assert_setup_identical` compares the reconstructed fingerprint to a
monolithic state's, and the gate runs it.

:func:`domain_header_view` then presents all of that as an object shaped like
a ``DomainState`` for exactly as long as the two fingerprint functions run,
with the domain's scheme lat/lon temporarily bound onto the buffer's scheme
objects and restored afterwards.  Nothing is stepped while it is bound.


THE PAGEABLE COPY IN ``restart._host``
--------------------------------------
``restart._host`` is a bare ``value.get()``: a PAGEABLE device-to-host copy
into a freshly allocated NumPy array, run on every one of the 229 carriers.
This module never calls it on a carrier -- there is no device array to copy --
so the question it raises is about the RESIDENT path.  MEASURED here rather
than argued (:func:`measure_write_cost`; RTX 5090, ext4 on NVMe, full+MYNN+
Noah-MP, best of 3, card SHARED with other work):

=====================================  ==============  ==============
                                        250x200x49      400x320x49
                                        0.638 GiB       1.633 GiB
=====================================  ==============  ==============
streamed (this module, 0 D2H)            0.577 s         1.685 s
resident ``write_restart`` (pageable)    0.799 s         3.251 s
resident with pinned staging             0.646 s         1.931 s
D2H alone, pageable                      11.10 GB/s      9.31 GB/s
D2H alone, pinned                        28.37 GB/s      36.23 GB/s
=====================================  ==============  ==============

Three things follow, and the first two contradict what this work was briefed
to expect:

1. The pinned/pageable ratio on the COPY is 2.56x and 3.89x here, not the
   13.9x (3.2 vs 44.6 GB/s) the brief quotes.  Both destinations in this
   measurement are allocated ONCE, outside the timing; a benchmark that
   allocates a fresh pageable buffer per copy is timing ``malloc`` and the
   first-touch page faults as well as the transfer, and that is where a
   ratio that large comes from.
2. The isolated copy is only 6-8% of the resident write's wall time -- and
   yet replacing ``_host`` with pinned staging cuts that write by 19% and
   41%.  The difference is exactly the allocation and first-touch cost item
   1 excludes: ``.get()`` creates 229 new pageable buffers on every
   checkpoint.  So the pageable copy IS worth fixing, but not for the reason
   usually given, and the accurate way to state the win is end-to-end.
3. None of it matters for this lane, because the streamed writer does not
   make the copy at all -- 1.39x and 1.93x faster than the resident writer,
   with no resident device state to be faster than.  Above the card's
   ceiling (measured elsewhere in this project at 928^2 on a 5090) there is
   no resident path to compare against and this is the only writer there is.

For scale: at 250x200x49 -- ``configs/real74_d01.toml``, an operational
domain -- a checkpoint is 0.638 GiB and 0.577 s against a model step of
0.485 s on the same shared card.  Radiation and cumulus fired ZERO times in
that step window (radt = 12 min, dt = 3 s), so the step is a LOWER bound and
"a checkpoint costs about one step" is a conservative statement of the cost.


THE PROOF
---------
:func:`round_trip_case` streams N steps, writes a restart from the pinned
store, builds a FRESH store and FRESH tile buffers, reads the restart back,
streams N more, and compares carrier digests against an uninterrupted 2N-step
streamed run AND against a 2N-step monolithic run.  Same digest or it does not
work.  Three controls ship with it, because a comparison nobody has seen fail
is not evidence:

``drop=("fields/ust",)`` with ``allow_missing=True``
    one carrier left out of the file, the reader told not to mind.  The fresh
    store keeps that field's PREPARATION value and the run diverges -- the
    exact silent-drop failure the three-inventory trap produces.  MUST differ.

``drop=("fields/ust",)`` with the default ``allow_missing=False``
    the same file, read normally: the reader REFUSES.  That is the guard that
    makes the first control a bug you cannot ship rather than a bug you can.

``preset="poison"``
    the fresh store filled with NaN before the restore instead of with the
    preparation state.  Still bit-exact, so nothing in the answer came from
    what the store held before the restart was read.

MEASURED, ``tilestream/test_restart_gate.py``, 96x80x49 on a real Lambert
projection with real terrain, 12 round-trip rows over 5 rungs (dry through
229-carrier ``full+MYNN+Noah-MP`` and the fast-cadence rung where radiation
fires every step and cumulus every second step): round trip == uninterrupted
streamed == monolithic, same sha256, on every positive row; all three
negative controls diverge (119, 41 and 38 carriers, worst 7.2e+03, 1.7e+06
and 6.4e+03 absolute); all four refusals refuse.  ``woof.io.restart.
restore_restart`` -- the resident reader, with the enforced driver-payload
validation this module deliberately does not reimplement -- reads a streamed
file into an ordinary DomainState bit-exactly, and the streamed reader reads
a file written by ``restart.write_restart`` bit-exactly.

    :func:`tilestream.physics_inventory.carrier_scalars` -- the clock and the

    ``setup`` and ``template_state`` are what the header needs; see the module

    The file is byte-for-byte a ``woof.io.restart`` v5 archive: same header
    keys, same member names, same atomic ``.tmp`` publish and ``fsync``, and
    ``woof.io.restart.restore_restart`` reads it into an ordinary resident

    writer's first act is to materialise a full host copy of a domain that,
    at the sizes this lane is for, does not fit on the card in the first
    place.

    ``extra_scratch_slots`` uses the resident writer's explicit lifecycle
    opt-in for allocated tracker windows; the ordinary checkpoint set is unchanged.

    ``drop`` omits the named members.  It is the negative control -- see
    :func:`round_trip_case` -- and it prints what it dropped, because a
    silent-drop control that is itself silent has failed at its job.

    Refuses, rather than writing a short file, when the store's key set is

    ``HostDomainStore`` built with the default ``attrs=STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS``
