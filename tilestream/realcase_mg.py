"""The REAL forced decomposition gate: an ERA5 case through MultiGPUDomain.

:func:`tilestream.multigpu.gate_forced` proves the specified-BC decomposition
on a synthetic Lambert case whose forcing is two seeded harness states.  That
is the right instrument for the geometry and the windowing arithmetic, and it
is silent on the question a user actually asks: does a REAL analysis -- ERA5
ingested through the production preparation, full physics attached, real
terrain-following base state, real Davies relaxation toward real analysed air
-- hold the SAME bits decomposed that it holds resident?

This module asks exactly that, with the same three-part shape the streamed
real gate (:mod:`tilestream.run_realcase` ``gate``) uses:

1.  The case is PREPARED ONCE (``realcase.prepare``, the production
    ``prepare_root_experiment_case``), settled one step so every lazily
    allocated carrier exists, and its full carrier inventory, geography
    inventory and scalars are captured to host.  That capture feeds every arm,
    so any difference between arms is the decomposition's.

2.  The RESIDENT arm is ``dycore.step`` on the whole domain with the domain's
    own attached boundaries -- what a single-GPU production run of this case
    is -- and its digest is the reference.

3.  Each DECOMPOSED arm rebuilds the same start through
    :class:`tilestream.multigpu.MultiGPUDomain`: rank buffers built by
    ``realcase.tile_state_builder`` (the case's own vertical coordinate and
    base-state arithmetic), the domain's REAL geography scattered per rank
    with the same gather rectangles ``load_from_host`` uses, the domain's
    ``LateralBoundaries`` windowed per rank by the constructor (real tables
    on true edges, inert tables on seams), carriers loaded from the shared
    host capture, scalars imposed, and the run stepped in lock-step.  The
    assembled interiors must digest bit-identically to the resident arm.

Rank count and device count are independent: ``--device 0`` runs every rank
on one card, which gates the full geometry, windowing and forcing arithmetic
(the transport degenerates to same-device copies).  That is the proven
pattern from the periodic gate and it is what this module runs by default.

NEGATIVE CONTROLS, four of them, because a bit-exact green on real data is
exactly the shape of good news this project has been wrong about before:

``poison``    seam tables poisoned with a large finite value MUST still
              match -- the halo pad, not luck, quarantines seam-side
              boundary fiction (the ``realcase.py`` proof shape).
``scaled``    every TRUE side table scaled by 1.000001 MUST differ -- an
              arm that matches because the forcing never reached the answer
              is a green light on nothing.
``skip``      one edge rank's boundary application suppressed (the dycore's
              ``apply_state_lateral_boundaries`` no-opped for that rank's
              state only) MUST differ -- the per-rank application is
              essential, in the direction of doing less.
``double``    another edge rank's application run twice per RK stage MUST
              differ -- essential in the direction of doing more.  The
              spec-zone overwrite is idempotent, so what this control
              measures is the relaxation-zone blend, which is not.
