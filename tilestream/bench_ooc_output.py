"""Does out-of-core streaming make OUTPUT cheaper?  Measured end to end.

Phase 1 (``tilestream.bench_output``) decomposed one monolithic frame and
established the ceilings: the filesystem, the D2H, the netCDF encode, the
overlap control.  It stopped one step short of the hypothesis, in two ways
that this module exists to close:

1. It timed the out-of-core *staging* (a host derive of T and P) against the
   monolithic *staging* (DERIVE + pinned alloc + D2H) and then ASSUMED the
   netCDF write that follows is identical for both.  It never actually ran a
   frame through ``WrfoutWriter`` out of a :class:`~tilestream.hoststore.
   HostDomainStore`.  Handing netCDF a long-lived pinned view is not obviously
   the same as handing it a freshly-pooled pinned buffer, so that is measured
   here rather than assumed.

2. It never checked that the two paths write the SAME BYTES.  They do not.
   See :func:`mode_verify`.

The third thing this module adds is the question Phase 1 could not ask,
because it never ran the driver: in a tiled run the store is host-resident
continuously, so can a frame be written WHILE the GPU steps?  That depends
entirely on ``run_tiled``'s read/write discipline, and the answer differs
between the two write modes -- see :func:`mode_tear`.

    """THE ATTRACTIVE CLAIM, tested against the real driver.

    The claim: the store is host-resident continuously, so a frame can be
    written while the GPU computes, touching memory the solver is not using.

    Whether that is true is decided by ``run_tiled``'s read/write discipline,
    and the two write modes differ completely:

      shadow  tiles READ ``src`` and WRITE ``other``; the two swap at the end
              of every sweep.  ``src`` is untouched for the whole sweep, so a
              reader gets a clean time-t snapshot -- for ONE sweep.
      ring    (the DEFAULT, and the mode that buys 1.90x the domain) keeps
              ONE store.  ``src is dst is home``.  Every tile reads and writes
              it in the same sweep.

    CONTROL THAT CAN FAIL: the concurrent snapshot's digest is compared with
    the digest at time t and at time t+dt.  Clean => it equals one of them.
    Torn => it equals neither.  Shadow is expected clean and ring torn; if
    ring came out clean the claim would stand as written.
