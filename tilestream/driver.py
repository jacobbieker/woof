"""The tiled stepping loop: gather -> step -> scatter, one tile at a time.

This is the module that turns the geometry (:mod:`tilestream.spec`), the
transport (:mod:`tilestream.gather`) and the pinned full-domain store
(:mod:`tilestream.hoststore`) into an actual integration.  It is also where the
one bug that would silently invalidate the whole idea lives, so that bug gets
its own section.


THE READ-AT-TIME-t RULE
-----------------------
A tile's halo exists so the tile can see its neighbours *as they were at the
start of the step*.  If tile A's freshly-stepped interior is written back into
the same array that tile B then gathers its halo from, B sees A at time
``t + dt`` while seeing itself at time ``t``.  The result is not "slightly
wrong": it is a different, inconsistent time-stepping scheme that happens to
run and happens to look plausible.  Nothing about a hash tells you which of the
two you got, which is why this module makes the distinction explicit and
testable:

``write_mode="ring"`` (default, CORRECT, and the one that scales)
    One store.  Before a tile is stepped, the part of its interior that a
    LATER tile will read -- its ring -- is copied out to a small arena, and a
    tile's gather is patched from the arenas of the tiles already written, so
    every window holds time-t values everywhere.  Costs a fraction of a
    second store instead of a whole one: MEASURED 4.97% of the store's bytes
    at 1950^2 tile 650 and 2.39% at 5412^2 tile 1353, against 100% for the
    shadow.  The 8x4090 box measured the same quantity on ITS hardware and
    got 5.2% at 1950^2 tile 650 and 5.8% at 3276^2 tile 546 -- carried here
    because the two boxes DISAGREE at the one plan they share (4.97% against
    5.2% at 1950^2 tile 650), and a ring-cost figure quoted without its box
    is therefore not a number.  See ``tilestream/RECONCILIATION.md``.
    :mod:`tilestream.rings` owns the geometry and states the four ways the
    scheme goes silently wrong; the ordering it needs from THIS module is in
    the loop's block comment.

``write_mode="shadow"`` (also CORRECT, kept as the reference)
    Every tile reads buffer *R* and writes buffer *W*.  The interiors partition
    the domain exactly (``spec.validate_plan`` proves it), so at the end of a
    sweep *W* is a complete new domain and the two buffers are swapped.  Costs
    a second full-domain store.  Retained because it is the independent
    implementation the ring path is checked against -- the gate runs both and
    demands identical digests -- and because it has no ordering requirements
    at all, so it is the thing to fall back to if a ring plan cannot be built.

``write_mode="inplace"`` (WRONG ON PURPOSE)
    Tiles read and write the same buffer, with no ring saved and no patch.
    Provided so the gate can show that it *detects* the error rather than
    merely avoiding it -- a gate that has never seen a failure is not a gate.
    It is also precisely "the ring scheme minus the ring", which is what makes
    it the right negative control for this module.  ``run_tiled`` warns every
    time it is selected.


WHAT A TILE IS STEPPED AS
-------------------------
A tile is just a smaller domain.  ``tile_cfg`` is the parent ``RunConfig`` with
``nx``/``ny`` replaced by the tile's GATHERED extents (interior + 2*halo), not
its interior extents -- the ~15 sites that read ``cfg.nx``/``cfg.ny`` are
computing launch geometry for the array in hand, and that array is the gathered
one.  Everything else (dx, dt, sound steps, damping, physics selectors) is
carried through untouched.

The tile ``DomainState`` is built ONCE per buffer and reused for every tile.
That is safe for two independent reasons, and both are checked rather than
assumed: the gather covers the tile's persisted arrays completely
(``require_full_gather=True`` in :mod:`tilestream.gather` asserts the
rectangles tile the destination exactly), and nothing outside the persisted set
carries information across a step -- which
:func:`assert_streaming_inventory_complete` demonstrates by dirtying a state,
refilling only the streamed fields, and showing the trajectory is unchanged.


PHYSICS
-------
A physics-on domain carries far more than ``STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS``, and
three of this module's assumptions had to be replaced rather than widened.
:func:`physics_run_kwargs` supplies all four pieces; the reasons are:

``inventory_fn=physics_inventory.carrier_inventory``
    ``gather.inventory`` reaches the contract attributes by ``getattr`` and
    therefore cannot see ``state._scratch`` (the mp/cu precipitation
    accumulators) or ``state.physics`` (the held tendencies and the 88-to-162
    surface/soil/snow ``fields``) AT ALL.  Streaming the contract set at a
    physics rung leaves 1.79x more carried bytes behind than it moves, and
    MEASURED it changes 127 of 229 carriers after eight steps.

``nz=cfg.nz``
    Noah's soil columns are ``(4, ny, nx)``, Noah-MP's snow layers
    ``(3, ny, nx)`` and its snow-soil coordinate ``(7, ny, nx)``.  Their
    leading axis is not vertical, so ``gather.domain_extents`` cannot infer
    the vertical extent from the inventory -- it used to answer 3.

``tile_state_factory=make_physics_tile_state``
    The buffer needs a ``PhysicsDriver`` (``dycore.step`` raises without one)
    and needs to have STEPPED ONCE (Kain-Fritsch's ``w0avg`` and friends are
    allocated lazily, so a never-stepped buffer has a shorter inventory than
    the store).

``scalars=carrier_scalars(parent)``
    The domain clock.  See ``run_tiled``'s docstring: without it a buffer
    serving k tiles runs k*dt ahead of the domain inside one sweep and tiles
    disagree about which schemes are due.

GEOGRAPHY
---------
A tile's ``DomainState`` and ``PhysicsDriver`` are constructed on
``tile_cfg``, so everything they DERIVE is derived for the tile's extents.
For a real map projection that is catastrophic and silent:
``woof/static/projection.py:122-123`` defaults the reference point to
``(e_we/2, e_sn/2)`` and ``_grid_xy`` (:176-179) counts DOMAIN indices, so a
rebuilt tile believes it is centred where the whole domain is centred.  The
displacement is a rigid translation by ``ci0 + (cnx+1)/2 - (nx+1)/2`` cells
per axis -- and the exactly-centred tile is BIT-EXACT, which is precisely
what lets a one-tile test certify the bug.

The rule this module implements is: GEOGRAPHY IS INPUT.  It is computed once
for the whole domain and GATHERED per tile like any other field; it is never
rebuilt from ``tile_cfg`` and never scattered back.  ``run_tiled(geography=
...)`` takes the domain's :func:`geography_inventory` and installs each
tile's window into the buffer.  Three details make the difference between
that working and looking like it works:

* it is gathered ONCE PER BUFFER OCCUPANCY, not once per step.  MEASURED
  (:func:`tilestream.harness.make_physics_state`, 8 steps, 229 carriers,
  real Lambert + real terrain): all 33 geography arrays are bit-identical
  after the run, so re-sending them every step is pure traffic.  With
  ``nbuffers >= len(specs)`` each buffer serves one tile and the gather
  happens exactly once for the whole run.
* ``has_msf``/``rotational`` are re-imposed from the DOMAIN.
  ``set_map_coriolis`` (state.py:799-803) recomputes both from ``.any()``
  over whatever window it was handed, and they gate whole code paths
  (``dycore.py:539``, ``moist.py:470-559``, ``physics.py:1268``).  A tile
  whose window happens to be uniform would flip them.
* the four scheme latitude/longitude grids are gathered too.  Every
  solar-zenith path in the tree reads PER-COLUMN lat/lon arrays and only the
  clock terms are scalars, but those arrays live on the SCHEME object, not
  on the state and not in the carrier manifest -- and two of the four
  (legacy RRTMG, Noah-MP) are HOST numpy rather than device.

:func:`assert_geography_gathered` refuses anything the gather cannot reach.
Its one known customer is legacy RRTMG's ozone cache, which is interpolated
to the domain's latitudes at CONSTRUCTION and stored ``(ny*nx, 59, 12)`` --
horizontal axes FLATTENED and LEADING, so the transport cannot window it and
gathering ``latitude_deg`` would not fix it.  That configuration is refused,
not approximated.

THE SCALARS, stated explicitly because a scalar cannot be gathered
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Searched rather than assumed.  ``RunConfig`` has 147 fields and the only two
that touch geography are ``map_proj`` and ``terrain_opt`` -- there is no
``ref_lat``/``ref_lon``/``truelat``/``stand_lon``/``known_x``/``known_y``
anywhere in it, so a tile config cannot carry a reference point even in
principle, and there is no f-plane reference latitude to get wrong.  Three
scalar families remain and each is handled here:

``has_msf`` / ``rotational``
    RECOMPUTED per tile by ``set_map_coriolis`` from ``.any()`` over the
    window.  Imposed from the domain -- see :func:`geography_scalars`.  The
    gate's ``impose_geography_flags=False`` control measures what happens
    otherwise: 32 of 229 carriers differ.

``mub`` / ``p_top`` / ``cf1,cf2,cf3,cfn,cfn1``
    Pure functions of the vertical coordinate and the base sounding, so a
    tile rebuilds them exactly -- EXCEPT ``mub``, which ``load_base``
    retires to ``None`` the moment terrain makes ``mub2d`` the authority
    (state.py:744-751).  A buffer built flat against a parent with terrain
    disagrees on a scalar rather than on an array;
    :func:`setup_scalar_mismatches` is what catches it, and
    :func:`geography_run_kwargs` builds the buffer with terrain so it
    cannot happen.

the solar clock, and ``cen_lat``
    Every zenith path in the tree takes per-column lat/lon ARRAYS; the only
    scalars in it (declination, equation of time, solcon, gmt/xtime) are
    functions of the CLOCK, which ``scalars=`` already carries.  MEASURED at
    96x80 with a real Lambert grid: COSZEN spans 0.84649 to 0.93134 across
    the domain, i.e. it genuinely varies per column.  The one true
    geography SCALAR in the tree is ``cen_lat``, taken by
    ``woof/core/landuse.py:327`` to pick the LANDUSE.TBL season (reversed
    south of the equator, :389).  It is INITIALIZATION-only: the 15 fields
    ``LanduseInitialization`` produces (landmask, xland, lakemask, ivgtyp,
    isltyp, snowc, pblh, ust, mavail, z0, znt, albbck, albedo, embck,
    emiss) are all ``fields/*`` carriers, so a tile buffer's own landuse is
    overwritten by the first gather and its ``cen_lat`` never reaches a
    step.  A caller that does construct landuse per tile must pass the
    DOMAIN's ``cen_lat``, not the tile's -- on a domain straddling the
    equator the season would otherwise flip between tiles.

    the tiled run cannot match a monolithic one no matter how wide the halo
    is.  This check is the structural guarantee behind the whole design: the

    WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY IT HAD TO
    -------------------------------
    Through milestone one this compared ``harness.hash_field_map``, which
    walks ``STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS``.  That made it BLIND in exactly the
    region it was supposed to police: anything in ``state._scratch`` or on
    ``state.physics`` was never refilled (so it stayed dirty) and never
    compared (so the dirt never showed).  MEASURED: at ``moist=True,
    mp_physics=10`` the old check returned PASS while
    ``scratch/mp_rainnc`` and ``driver/pending_rainbl`` were demonstrably
    carried and unstreamed.  At any rung with ``physics_enabled(cfg)`` it did
    not run at all -- its probe states came from ``harness.make_state``,
    which attaches no ``PhysicsDriver``, so ``dycore.step`` raised first.

    It now compares -- and refills -- the whole restart manifest
    (:func:`tilestream.physics_inventory.carrier_manifest`), and builds its
    probes with a driver attached.  For a dry config that manifest IS the
    nine contract arrays, so the milestone-one meaning is unchanged; for
    every physics rung it is the 138-to-229 carriers that actually exist.
    ``nsteps`` defaults to 8 rather than 2 on this project's own precedent:
    the minimum halo was certified wrong twice by tests at N <= 3, and at a
    long radiation/cumulus cadence a 2-step run passes with the scalar
    carriers dropped purely because no cadence boundary falls inside it.

    ``names`` selects a SUBSET to stream while still comparing everything --
    which is how a candidate smaller inventory gets refuted rather than
    assumed.  Passing the milestone-one contract names at a physics rung is
    the negative control, and it fails as it should.

# the loop
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

class TiledRun:
    """A domain streamed tile-by-tile through the GPU, one SWEEP per call.

    A ``TiledRun`` owns everything that must survive between model steps --
    the tile buffers, their streams, the ring arena, each buffer's geography
    and boundary occupancy, and the domain clock -- and :meth:`sweep`
    advances the store by one model step (or ``nsteps`` of them).  The split
    exists because WOOF's own run loop has to BE the loop: woof.core.model
    and woof.runtime decide when output, restart, diagnostics and nest
    coupling happen, and a streaming mode that owned the time loop could only
    ever be a parallel universe beside the model, never a mode of it.

    It is not a style question.  MEASURED: constructing the tile buffers
    costs 3.3 s for a 544-cell dry buffer, so driving a model step with
    ``run_tiled(..., nsteps=1)`` reads 8.7x slower over four steps than one
    call of four.  Worse, it silently breaks the property the geography
    argument rests on -- a buffer's geography is gathered when that buffer
    CHANGES TILE, and buffers rebuilt every step change tile every step, so
    "gather once per buffer" becomes "gather once per tile per step" and the
    read-only arrays turn into the dominant transfer.

    :func:`run_tiled` is this class constructed and swept once, and remains
    the surface the gate drives.

    ``store`` holds the full domain -- a
    :class:`tilestream.hoststore.HostDomainStore`, a
    :class:`tilestream.gather.HostStore`, a plain ``{name: array}`` mapping or
    even a ``DomainState``.  Host buffers must be pinned (pass
    ``allow_pageable=True`` only to debug; pageable transfers run at a quarter
    of the speed and are not truly asynchronous).  The store is updated IN
    PLACE and nothing is returned; pass ``report={}`` for the diagnostics.

    ``tile_nx``/``tile_ny`` are INTERIOR extents.  Each tile is stepped over
    ``tile_nx + 2*halo`` by ``tile_ny + 2*halo`` mass cells and only its
    interior is written back.  ``halo`` must be at least the per-step
    dependency radius, ``tilestream.harness.halo_radius(cfg)``; the default 16
    is correct for ``time_step_sound == 4`` and too small above it.

    ``nbuffers`` tile states and streams are cycled so tile *i+1*'s gather
    overlaps tile *i*'s compute.  Within a sweep the tiles are completely
    independent (they read one buffer and write another, over disjoint
    interiors), so the only ordering required is a sync at the end of each
    sweep.  ``nbuffers`` changes no arithmetic and must not change the answer;
    the gate checks that it does not.

    ``pipeline`` chooses the order the copies are SUBMITTED in, which on a
    single-copy-engine card decides whether any of them overlap at all -- see
    the block comment on the loop below, and the 1.30x it is worth.
    ``"prefetch"`` (default) issues tile *i+depth*'s gather before tile *i*'s
    scatter; ``"naive"`` is the obvious per-tile order and is kept so the
    difference stays measurable.  Neither changes the answer.

    ``periodic`` sets both axes; ``periodic_x`` / ``periodic_y`` override one
    and are what a MIXED domain needs.  ``cfg.open_x=True, open_y=False`` --
    radiative-open across the flow, periodic along it -- is non-periodic in x
    and wrapping in y, and a plan that clamps y hands the south-most tile an
    owned row 0 with no halo beneath it while the kernels stepping it wrap to
    the far side of the WINDOW.  Take them from
    ``autoplan.is_periodic_x``/``is_periodic_y``, which are the dycore's own
    ``_boundary_x``/``_boundary_y`` negated; never guess.

    ``write_mode`` picks how time-t neighbour values are kept alive:
    ``"ring"`` (default) saves each tile's ring into a small arena and
    patches the gathers from it, keeping ONE store; ``"shadow"`` keeps a
    whole second store; ``"inplace"`` keeps neither and is wrong on purpose.
    See the module docstring.  ``ring_margin`` selects a deliberately broken
    ring for the gate's negative controls (``"halo"``, ``"x_only"``; see
    :func:`tilestream.rings.build_ring_plan`) and must be ``"exact"`` for a
    forecast.

    ``ring_ordering`` decides how the two cross-stream hazards are enforced:
    ``"events"`` (default) records one event per tile and waits on the
    neighbours the plan names, which is correct on any hardware;
    ``"submission"`` relies on this card's single DMA queue draining in
    submission order.  MEASURED, and the answer is why the default is what it
    is: ``"submission"`` is bit-exact on an IDLE card and WRONG BY 3.7e+02 on
    the same 3x3 plan while another process shares the GPU.  It is kept only
    as that measurement.  Never use it for a forecast.

    ``overlap`` moves the ring sweep's copies onto DEDICATED STREAMS so they
    can run beside the compute: per buffer, a copy-in stream (geography,
    boundary bind, carrier gather, ring patch), the compute stream, and a
    copy-out stream (ring save, scatter), ordered by the event chain
    :mod:`tilestream.overlap` derives from the ring plan and re-checks
    against the plan's own rectangles at construction.  When nothing armed
    on the run needs a hard sweep barrier (no graphs, no health fold, no
    timeline, no ``on_sweep``), the end-of-sweep synchronization is deferred
    too: the next step's gathers chain on the previous step's scatter events
    and the pipeline stays primed across ``sweep()`` calls, which is the
    single biggest exposed term OVERLAP-ATTRIBUTION.md measured.  Anything
    that reads the store between sweeps goes through :attr:`store` or
    :meth:`drain`.  ``"on"`` (default) changes no arithmetic and must not
    change the answer -- the gate checks that it does not; ``"off"`` is the
    single-stream loop, kept as the reference; ``"unchained"`` (WRONG ON
    PURPOSE) keeps the dedicated streams and drops every cross-stream wait,
    the negative control that shows the chain is essential.  A non-ring
    ``write_mode`` degrades ``"on"`` to ``"off"``: the chain is derived from
    a RingPlan and the shadow already pays for its ordering with a second
    store.  ``ring_ordering="submission"`` also degrades to ``"off"`` -- it
    is kept as a measurement of the single-stream loop's single DMA queue,
    and on dedicated copy streams that queue does not exist, so the
    observation only means anything on the loop it was made on.  The
    broken-on-purpose ring margins skip the construction-time hazard check
    (their plans are unsound by construction and exist to be caught by the
    digest); a forecast is always ``ring_margin="exact"`` and always gets
    the check.

    ``inventory_fn`` / ``nz`` / ``scalars`` are the three things a PHYSICS run
    needs and a dry one does not; :func:`physics_run_kwargs` supplies all
    three plus the tile factory.

    ``inventory_fn``
        How a store and a tile state are turned into ``{name: array}``.  The
        default reaches ``STATE_SERIALIZED_ATTRS`` by ``getattr`` and cannot
        see ``state._scratch`` or ``state.physics`` at all; pass
        :func:`tilestream.physics_inventory.carrier_inventory` to stream the
        whole restart manifest.

    ``nz``
        The vertical extent, when the inventory holds layered fields whose
        leading axis is not vertical (Noah's 4 soil levels, Noah-MP's 3 snow
        levels and 7-deep snow-soil coordinate).  Without it
        ``gather.domain_extents`` would have to infer nz, and for that
        inventory the accurate answer is that it cannot.

    ``scalars``
        The DOMAIN's :func:`tilestream.physics_inventory.carrier_scalars`
        -- ``elapsed_seconds`` and the driver's call counters.  Restored onto
        the buffer before EVERY tile step and advanced once per sweep, not
        once per tile.  Without this a buffer serving k tiles runs k*dt ahead
        of the domain inside a single sweep, so tiles disagree about whether
        radiation/cumulus/PBL is due and integrate different physics -- with
        no NaN, no warning and a perfectly plausible answer.  Updated in
        place, so the caller's dict reflects the domain clock on return.

    ``geography``
        The DOMAIN's :func:`geography_inventory` -- map factors, Coriolis,
        rotation, terrain, the terrain-following base state and the scheme
        latitude/longitude grids.  READ-ONLY: gathered into a buffer when
        that buffer starts serving a different tile, never scattered, never
        re-sent per step.  ``has_msf``/``rotational`` are computed from the
        DOMAIN (see :func:`geography_scalars`) and imposed on every buffer,
        because ``set_map_coriolis`` would otherwise derive them from the
        tile's own window.  Omitting it leaves every tile with the geography
        it REBUILT from ``tile_cfg`` -- centred on the tile rather than on
        the domain, correct only for the exactly-centred tile, and that is
        the gate's negative control.

    ``tile_hook``
        ``tile_hook(tile_state, tspec, itile, stream)``, called when a buffer
        starts serving a different tile -- the same condition the geography
        gather fires on, and inside that buffer's stream, before the carrier
        gather.

        It exists for LATERAL BOUNDARIES, which are the one per-tile input
        the array transport cannot express.  Geography is an inventory of
        arrays on the domain grid and windows like any carrier; the four
        boundary side tables have a DIFFERENT SHAPE PER SIDE, are attached
        through ``woof.ingest.lateral_bc.attach_lateral_boundaries`` (which
        uploads into state-owned scratch and installs a device descriptor
        rather than writing an inventory array), and which side is a TRUE
        DOMAIN EDGE versus an interior seam is a property of the
        :class:`~tilestream.spec.TileSpec`, not of the ``tile_cfg`` the tile
        factory is handed.

        A tile's true edges take the domain's own tables, sliced along the
        tangential axis; its interior seams take tables that are inert.
        MEASURED, at 256x192x49, tile 32x32, real Lambert + real terrain +
        specified BCs, halo 16 from ``harness.halo_radius``: seam tables of
        ZEROS, seam tables holding the domain's own coupled values with zero
        tendency, and seam tables of DELIBERATE GARBAGE (1e6 in coupled
        units, 1e4/s of tendency) all give the BIT-IDENTICAL answer, out to
        N=24 steps.  The seam relaxation provably cannot reach the interior.
        The controls that must fire do: tables not windowed at all, and true
        edges scaled by 1.000001, both differ in all nine dry carriers.

    ``observer``
        ``observer(tile_state, tspec, itile, stream)``, called inside that
        tile's stream immediately AFTER its step and before its interior is
        scattered back -- the one instant in a sweep at which a buffer holds
        real, current domain data on the card.

        It exists for the run loop's SAFETY OBSERVERS.  ``woof.runtime
        .integrate_prepared_case`` guards a forecast with a whole-domain
        ``stability_report`` every dynamics substep and with
        ``StateHealthValidator.require_healthy`` on a cadence, and it hands
        both the prepared ``DomainState``.  Under a HOST store that state is
        a copy taken at t=0 (``streaming.attach`` fills the store with
        ``gather.pinned_copy``) which no sweep ever writes again, so the NaN
        guard, the w_max monitor and the CFL monitor all observe a snapshot
        that is healthy by construction: ``nan_free`` stays true, ``w_max``
        stays at its initial value, and a domain that went non-finite in the
        store completes and checkpoints as a clean forecast.

        The observers are pure -- they carry nothing into the answer -- which
        is exactly why nothing caught it.  They are also max/OR folds, so
        they are associative, and tile interiors PARTITION the domain: one
        record per tile, folded, IS the whole-domain record.  Keeping the
        DomainState current instead is not an option and not a shortcut that
        was skipped -- the premise of the mode is that the domain does not
        fit on the card, so there is no resident copy to refresh.  Every
        whole-domain observer either becomes a fold or stops being armed.

        The observer must read the INTERIOR, never the whole buffer.  The
        halo is at least the per-step dependency radius so the interior is
        bit-exact, but the halo itself was stepped with insufficient
        neighbours; folding it in would let a discarded halo raise a NaN the
        domain never had, and a false alarm on the run's only safety gate is
        no better than a missing one.

    ``post_step_hook``
        ``post_step_hook(tile_state, tspec, itile, stream)``, called on EVERY
        tile immediately after its ``dycore.step`` and before the scatter,
        inside that buffer's stream.  ``tile_hook`` fires only when a buffer
        changes tile, which is the right cadence for an INPUT; this one fires
        every step, which is the right cadence for something a step PRODUCES.

        It exists for ONE-FRAME PRODUCER/CONSUMER HANDOFFS, of which the
        model has exactly one: ``woof.core.refl.stash_refl_10cm`` parks the
        step's REFL_10CM on the physics driver and refuses to overwrite an
        unconsumed handoff, because in a resident run a second unconsumed
        field IS a cadence bug.  In a sweep the handoff is per TILE and the
        frame is per DOMAIN, so the SECOND tile a buffer serves raises
        "REFL_10CM stash was not consumed before reuse" -- an error whose
        text describes a defect that is not present.  The values are not in
        the handoff: ``stash_refl_10cm`` stores a reference to the
        state-owned ``refl_10cm`` scratch slot, and it is that slot the
        scatter carries.  So the hook clears the reference and the transport
        joins the four tile windows exactly as it joins everything else.
        :func:`woof.core.streaming.attach` installs it; see
        :func:`woof.core.streaming.refl_handoff_hook`.

        THE SAME INSTANT AS ``observer``, and deliberately a second
        parameter rather than one shared slot.  Two branches invented this
        hook independently for two different owners -- a READER that folds
        the safety record out of the buffer, and a WRITER that clears the
        reflectivity handoff -- and a streamed forecast wants both at once.
        Collapsing them would make one consumer wrap the other and decide
        the ordering on the other's behalf.  ``observer`` runs first: it
        only reads, so it cannot be disturbed by the hook, while the hook
        mutates the buffer's driver.

    ``check_geography``
        Run :func:`assert_geography_gathered` on the first buffer, once, so a
        scheme that derives geography the transport cannot window (legacy
        RRTMG's ozone cache) is refused rather than silently rebuilt.

    ``tile_hook(tile_state, tspec, itile, stream)``
        Called when a buffer STARTS SERVING A DIFFERENT TILE, immediately
        after that buffer's geography gather is issued and before its
        carriers are gathered -- the one place per (buffer, tile) pair that
        exists.  It is the seam a SPECIFIED domain needs:
        :func:`tilestream.realcase.tile_boundary_binder` uses it to swap the
        buffer's lateral-boundary tables to the ones cut to THIS tile's
        window.  Nothing in the periodic lane passes it and the default
        ``None`` is exactly the old behaviour.

    ``impose_geography_flags=False`` (WRONG ON PURPOSE)
        Leaves ``has_msf``/``rotational`` at whatever the BUFFER derived from
        its own build, so a buffer built on
        :func:`tilestream.harness.neutral_geography` runs with the Coriolis
        kernel and the msf-weighted paths switched off while holding the
        domain's real map factors.  It exists so the gate can show that the
        imposition is essential rather than decorative.

    ``use_graph`` captures each buffer's step as a CUDA graph and REPLAYS it
    for every other tile that buffer serves.  This is the one optimisation
    that is worth more to a tiled sweep than to a resident run: the step's
    ~1,200 kernel launches are re-issued once per TILE, so the launch
    overhead is multiplied by the tile count, and it is worst on the small
    compute windows a small card is forced into.  ``True``/``"auto"`` falls
    back to ordinary stream launching for a step that cannot be captured and
    reports why; ``"require"`` raises instead, which is what a benchmark
    wants.  See :mod:`tilestream.graphcap` for the four ways a graph goes
    silently wrong and the mechanism that answers each.

    ``graph_reuse``
        ``"sweep"`` (default) keys the graph cache on the SWEEP as well as
        the cadence, so a graph is captured once per step and replayed once
        per tile -- which is exactly the re-use a tiled run needs, since the
        launch cost is what the tile count multiplies.  ``"run"`` re-uses a
        graph across steps of the same cadence: much cheaper (MEASURED at
        96x80, 2x2, N=8: 2 captures totalling 130 ms against 16 totalling
        423 ms) and sound only while no radiation-due step falls inside the
        run, because a graph bakes in every kernel's scalar arguments and
        RRTMGP takes the solar hour angle as one.  Bit-exact at mp10, +YSU
        and the ship config over N=8 at radt=12 min; WRONG at radt=0.05 min,
        which the gate runs as a negative control.

    ``graph_reuse="run"``, ``graph_key="none"`` and ``graph_scalars=False``
    are the gate's three negative controls: re-use a graph across steps,
    ignore the cadence as well, and skip the scalar-carrier increment a
    replay owes.  All three must produce a mismatch, and the gate asserts it
    -- and refuses to count an out-of-memory as a detection, because three
    of them once "passed" that way on a starved card.

    ``shared`` / ``chain_compute``
        The tile buffers' step-local scratch, rebuilt state symbols and
        RRTMGP chunk workspace can be ONE allocation instead of ``nbuffers``
        of them -- see :mod:`tilestream.shared_workspace`, and note that
        98.2% of a buffer's device footprint was per-buffer before it
        existed.  Pass the same
        :class:`~tilestream.shared_workspace.SharedTileWorkspaces` here that
        the tile factory was built with (``physics_run_kwargs(...,
        shared=...)`` does both).

        Passing it here does exactly one thing to the loop: it CHAINS THE
        COMPUTE.  Each buffer owns a non-blocking stream, and tile *i*'s
        ``step`` on stream ``i % nbuffers`` has nothing ordering it against
        tile *i+1*'s ``step`` on the next stream -- they are independent by
        construction, which is why the pipeline exists and why two of them
        may be executing at once.  Two concurrent steps sharing one arena
        would be writing the same bytes.  So an event is recorded after each
        ``step`` and the next tile's stream waits on it.  Copies are NOT
        chained, so the prefetch order still hides the transfer behind the
        compute; only compute/compute overlap is given up.

        ``chain_compute`` defaults to ``shared is not None`` and exists to be
        set to ``False`` WITH ``shared`` set: that is the negative control,
        it is the reclaimed buffer being reused while it is still live.

    ``timeline``
        Record a CUDA event either side of every tile's ``step`` and report
        ``overlapping_steps`` -- how many tiles began computing before their
        predecessor had finished.  WHETHER TWO TILES OVERLAP IS A PROPERTY OF
        THE CARD, NOT OF THIS CODE, and measuring it is the only portable way
        to state the safety property.  MEASURED at 96x96x49 tiles, dry, 3x3,
        nbuffers=2: on an RTX 5090 the unchained loop overlaps and a shared
        arena makes all nine carriers differ, four runs of four; on an RTX
        4090 the same run does NOT overlap and comes out bit-exact, because
        one tile already occupies the whole card.  A control that only
        watched the answer would have called the 4090 safe.  Off by default:
        it costs two events per tile and a synchronization at the end.

    Raises ``TiledRunError`` for a setup that cannot be right.  Warns, loudly,
    if ``write_mode="inplace"`` is selected -- see the module docstring.
