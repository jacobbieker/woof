"""Choose the tiling, so that nobody has to choose a tile size ever again.

``run_tiled`` takes a tile size, a buffer count and a halo.  All three are
traps, and two of them are silent:

* **the halo.**  Too small is bit-wrong AND faster, so a benchmark rewards
  it and a one-step test certifies it (``harness.halo_radius``'s docstring
  has the numbers: halo 13 at ``full+MYNN+Noah-MP`` is bit-exact at N=1 and
  wrong in 111 carriers at N=8).  This module never measures a halo.  It
  copies ``harness.halo_radius(cfg)`` and refuses to accept an override.
* **the tile size.**  Too big does not fit; too small spends the card on
  halo cells (MEASURED: a 160-cell window on a 1024^2 dry domain does 1.56x
  the necessary work and takes 1.36x the time); and a tile that does not
  DIVIDE the domain multiplies the ring arena by 4.2x (MEASURED: 3276^2
  costs 24.46% of the store at tile 512 and 5.84% at tile 546).
* **the buffer count.**  Worth ~32% when it fits and an out-of-memory crash
  when it does not, and whether it fits turns on a question this module had
  to answer with a measurement -- see below.

Give it a ``RunConfig`` and a :class:`Machine` and it answers: resident or
tiled; if tiled, what tile, how many buffers, how much pinned host RAM; and
if neither, WHICH resource is binding.  ``python -m tilestream.autoplan``
prints the plan and the reasoning for it.


THE COST MODEL, AND THE QUESTION NOBODY HAD CHECKED
---------------------------------------------------
The project's working figure was "~2.5 GiB FIXED plus ~656 B/cell, both for a
resident domain and for each tile buffer".  If the fixed part really were per
buffer, ``nbuffers=2`` would cost 5 GiB of fixed on a 12 GB card and the
overlap would be unaffordable there.  MEASURED instead, by building 1..4
physics states in ONE process and reading ``cudaMemGetInfo`` after each
(``--measure`` re-runs it)::

    full+MYNN+Noah-MP, 128^2 x 49, RTX 4090
        buffer 1   3392 MiB      buffer 3   1336 MiB
        buffer 2   1332 MiB      buffer 4   1340 MiB

The first buffer costs 2.0 GiB more than every buffer after it.  **The fixed
part is per PROCESS, not per buffer** -- and it has to be, because CUDA
context, module code and the RRTMGP k-distribution tables are process-wide.
What IS per buffer is much smaller, and only one rung has any of it at all:

===================  ==============  =============  ==========  ============
rung                 process fixed   buffer fixed   B/cell      carrier B/cell
===================  ==============  =============  ==========  ============
dry                       128 MiB          0 MiB     155           32.3
mp10 (moist only)          96 MiB        200 MiB     391          181.0
full(real74)+KF          3232 MiB         16 MiB     541          233.3
full+MYNN+Noah-MP        2560 MiB       1024 MiB     612          279.5
===================  ==============  =============  ==========  ============

so the model this module plans with is

    VRAM = context + process_fixed + nbuffers * (buffer_fixed + b * cells)

The consequence is the whole point: a second buffer on a 12 GB card costs
``buffer_fixed + b * window_cells``, NOT another 2.5 GiB, so overlap is
affordable on a small card and the planner takes it.  Three ways this could
have been got wrong and was not: the numbers come from a fit over 29 points
spanning k = 1..4 buffers and 0.8 to 20 Mcell on two different cards (4090
and 5090, agreeing to 6% on ``b`` at every rung); the fit is non-negative, so
none of the three terms is an artefact of the other two absorbing a sign; and
the worst UNDER-prediction over all points is -4.3%, which is what
:data:`VRAM_SAFETY` covers.

MULTIPLE DOMAINS IN ONE PROCESS
--------------------------------
The measurement above says the fixed part is per PROCESS.  A tree of nested
domains is ONE process, so the same sentence applies to DOMAINS and not only
to buffers, and :meth:`Footprint.process_overhead_bytes` is the part a second
domain does not pay again::

    VRAM(tree) = process_overhead + SUM over domains of marginal_bytes(d)

``woof.core.streaming.steppers_for_tree`` charges it exactly once.  It used
to charge ``vram_bytes`` -- context INCLUDED -- once per domain, which at the
``full`` rung is 3.760 GiB of phantom bytes for every domain after the first:
7.519 GiB on a three-domain tree, enough that a tree priced at 12.41 GiB was
refused outright on a 16.30 GiB card.

THE RADIATION TRANSIENT, AND WHY IT IS A RESERVATION AND NOT A CLAIM
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The cost model above prices what a forecast HOLDS.  A radiation step also
allocates, uses and frees a working set that nothing holds between calls, and
on the measured three-domain run below that transient was **+2.74 GiB** -- a
fifth of the whole forecast, recurring every radiation period and lasting
60-75 s of it.  Ignoring it is not conservative in either direction: it makes
the planner spend the bytes on a bigger tile and then meet the transient at
the first radiation call.

It is charged as a RESERVATION against free VRAM (see :func:`budget_for`),
not as a claim added to a domain's price, and it REPLACES the percentage
:data:`VRAM_HEADROOM` rather than stacking on it -- that guess exists for
exactly these first-use transients, so charging both counts the same bytes
twice.  All three of those choices are decided by the same measurement, a
9/3/1 km three-domain Poland forecast on node 1's 15.92 GiB (16,303 MiB)
card with 15.245 GiB free, RTE+RRTMGP at 49 levels:

======================================  ==========  =========================

measured radiation peak                     15.46    NVML, +2.74 over steady
peak headroom against the card               0.456   467 MiB, and it RAN
the tiling one step larger (350x250)        ~14.34   would peak 17.08: DEAD
======================================  ==========  =========================

Both arms are measured, and together they pin the arithmetic:

* as a CLAIM the tree prices 12.358 + 2.74 = 15.098 GiB against a 14.025 GiB
  budget and the run that completed is refused;
* as a reservation STACKED on the 8% headroom the budget is
  15.245 - 1.22 - 2.74 = 11.285 GiB, which buys a 175x250 tile -- 20 tiles
  where 12 ran, so a run that worked is planned slower for no reason;
* as a reservation REPLACING the headroom the budget is
  15.245 - 2.74 = 12.505 GiB, which selects 175x375 -- the tiling that
  actually ran -- and refuses 350x250, the tiling that would have died.

Only the third arm reproduces the observation on both sides, so that is the
one implemented.  :data:`RADIATION_TRANSIENT_BYTES` is the measured number and
the rungs that do not run RRTMGP carry zero.

WHAT THE CONSTANT DOES NOT YET KNOW.  It was measured at ONE column count and
one ``nz``; the run's own instrumentation says it "will not grow: RRTMGP's
workspace is a function of column count, which is fixed", and the same figure
priced both tilings above, so it is carried as a per-PROCESS constant rather
than scaled by a law nobody has measured.  ``woof.core.preflight``'s
shape-derived transient rail computes 1.464 GiB for this same tree -- 1.9x
under the measurement -- so the two rails disagree and the measurement wins
here.  ``tilestream.rrtmgp_ceiling`` already forces a radiation step and reads
the pool; running it at two or three column counts is what would turn this
constant into a slope.

Two things in the table deserve a second look.  ``full(real74)+KF`` has
3.2 GiB of process fixed and no per-buffer fixed; ``full+MYNN+Noah-MP`` has
2.6 GiB of process fixed and 1.0 GiB per buffer.  MYNN and Noah-MP move a
gigabyte of workspace from process scope to driver scope, so the rung with
the SMALLER one-time cost is the expensive one to run two buffers of.  And
the per-cell figures are 541-612 B/cell, not the 656 the project had been
using -- 7 to 20% high, which at the 5395^2 capacity headline is a third of a
tile.


WHAT THE PLANNER OPTIMISES, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO OPTIMISE
-----------------------------------------------------------
Subject to VRAM and pinned-host budgets, it minimises

    redundancy(tile) / overlap_gain(nbuffers)

where ``redundancy = ntiles_x*ntiles_y*(Tx+2h)*(Ty+2h) / (nx*ny)`` -- the
useful work divided into the work actually done, which counts a ragged
trailing tile's waste automatically because ``plan_tiles`` gives every tile
the SAME compute window and only the trailing interiors shrink.

It does NOT try to optimise the compute window for occupancy, because that
turned out not to be the effect it was assumed to be.  MEASURED here, a
monolithic dry step in ns per cell against the window edge:

    4090   128: 5.115   192: 3.692   256: 3.713   512: 4.109   1280: 4.539
    5090   128: 4.527   192: 3.228   256: 2.721   512: 2.806   1280: 3.027

Both cards are within 4% of their best by a 256-cell window and slowly get
WORSE above ~640 (cache, not occupancy); full physics saturates at 256 as
well (48.5 ns/cell at 256^2 on the 4090 against 82.8 at 128^2).  So "never
benchmark below ~500 cells" is a rule about the TILING TAX and not about the
arithmetic rate of the window.  :data:`MIN_COMPUTE_WINDOW` is therefore a
warning threshold, not a constraint.

Radiation and cumulus fired ZERO times inside every window timed above
(``radt=12 min`` and ``cudt=5 min`` against ``dt=3 s`` are 240 and 100 steps
apart, and the driver's ``call_counts`` were read on both sides to prove it);
sfclay/Noah-MP/PBL fired every step.  Those curves are a fast-cadence step,
which is 239 of every 240.

And the tiling tax itself, MEASURED against the objective it is supposed to
justify -- 1024^2 dry on a 4090, VRAM store so PCIe is out of it, nbuffers=2,
150 steps per call:

    tile  window  tiles  redundancy   tax    tax/redundancy
     128     160     64      1.562    1.359      0.870
     256     288     16      1.266    1.217      0.961
     512     544      4      1.129    1.346      1.192

Redundancy predicts the measured tax within 13% over an 8x range of tile
size, which is what makes it a usable objective.  It is not a perfect one:
the best row here is the MIDDLE tile, and the largest tile -- which this
planner would choose -- came out 10.6% worse than it.  Two effects pull
against each other and redundancy only sees one: a bigger window has lower
redundancy but a slightly worse arithmetic rate (the curve above), and four
tiles against two buffers leaves the pipeline almost nothing to overlap.  The
second is the more likely culprit and it is why a plan with fewer than three
tiles per buffer says so.  A one-configuration result is not enough to
rebuild the objective on, so the objective stands and the caveat is stated.

A warning for anyone who repeats that measurement: ``run_tiled`` builds its
``nbuffers`` tile states on every CALL, and a 544-cell dry buffer takes 3.3 s
to build.  At 4 steps per call that is 1650 ms/step of construction against
244 ms/step of physics, and the tax comes out at 8.7x with the largest tile
looking WORST by a factor of four.  At 30 steps the tile-512 row still read
2.25x.  Only at 150 steps do the numbers above stop moving.


HOST RAM, AND WHY /proc/meminfo IS NOT ALLOWED TO ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------
``hoststore`` will not pin more than 47% of MemTotal and page-locking walls
at 50% of it, both MEASURED.  But inside a container ``/proc/meminfo`` is the
HOST's -- on the box these constants were measured on it reports 503 GiB
while ``/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.max`` says 241.7 GiB, and a store sized from
the first number is a plan to be OOM-killed.  :meth:`Machine.detect` reads
the cgroup limit first, takes the smaller of the two, and refuses to guess at
all if it can see it is containerised and there is no limit to read.

``/proc/meminfo`` is the LINUX source, not the only one.  Windows has no
procfs, so :func:`_host_memtotal` asks the OS directly there
(``GlobalMemoryStatusEx``/``ullTotalPhys``), and the cgroup reads simply
find nothing and answer ``None`` -- which is the correct answer for a box
that is not containerised.  A planner that had no host source on Windows
did not fall back to a guess, it RAISED, and because
:func:`woof.core.streaming.decide` probes the machine before it reads the
configured budget, that refusal stood in front of every ``[tiles]`` run on
the platform the product's own front door ships on -- including the ones
that configured ``host_budget_bytes`` precisely to say what the budget was.

#:
#: WHAT IT DOES NOT BOUND is the tile count.  A domain much larger than

      read is protected by ordering the read ahead of the write, which halves
      the saved set against a four-sided ``interior - erosion(halo)``
      estimate.  So the kept core is eroded on ONE side per axis, not two.
    * **a ragged trailing tile is read right through.**  Its compute window is
      the same width as every other tile's, so it reaches ``tile + halo - r``
      cells past its own interior (``r`` = the ragged remainder) and its
      neighbour has to save a band that deep instead of ``halo`` deep.

    Per axis, then, the saved depth is ``halo`` for every tile plus that
    overhang once, and the two axes compose as ``1 - (1-fx)(1-fy)``.

    is cells, and the two agree because the staggered ``+1``s are a small

    ``write_mode="ring"`` keeps one store plus a few per cent; ``"shadow"``
    keeps two full stores and is only worth asking for when a concurrent
    reader needs the untouched time-t domain.

    ``footprint`` / ``rung`` override the cost model.  Pass ``footprint`` when
    the configuration is not one of the four measured rungs and you have run
    :func:`measure_footprint` on it; ``rung`` when you just want a different
    row of :data:`FOOTPRINTS`.

    ``minimum_halo`` reserves a larger dependency envelope when the caller
    knows the acoustic count can grow, as under adaptive stepping. It never
    reduces the current config's halo; the same value sizes every candidate,
    arena and reported byte count.

    ``max_nbuffers`` caps the pipeline depth.  Two are taken whenever they
    fit even at the cost of a smaller tile (worth 1.32x, measured); a third
    only when it is free at the tile already chosen.

    ``allow_ragged`` and ``prefer_exact`` control what happens when no tile
    divides the domain: by default a ragged tiling is allowed and an exact
    one is preferred inside :data:`ARENA_TIE_BAND`.  ``allow_ragged=False``
    turns "no exact tile fits" into a ``geometry`` refusal, which is the
    accurate answer for an extent like a prime -- a bigger card will not help.

    ``max_redundancy`` refuses a tiling that does more than that multiple of
    the necessary work -- the failure mode where a card is so small that the
    only window that fits is barely wider than two halos, and the run would
    technically proceed while spending most of the machine on halo cells.
    Pass ``None`` to allow it anyway.  :data:`MAX_REDUNDANCY` names what it
    prevents.  The refusal's ``detail`` carries the tiling it refused
    (``tile``, ``ntiles``, ``window``, ``halo``, ``redundancy``, ``limit``)
    so a caller can quote it without parsing the sentence.

    The boundary condition is read off ``cfg`` and constrains the search: on
    a non-periodic domain ``plan_tiles`` clamps the window inside the domain
    instead of wrapping and REFUSES a window wider than the domain, so tile
    plus two halos has to fit in ``nx`` and ``ny``.

    Raises :class:`CannotPlan` with ``.resource`` set to the binding resource
    -- ``"vram"``, ``"host"`` or ``"geometry"``.
