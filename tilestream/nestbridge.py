"""What a domain tree needs from a STREAMED parent, and the one piece missing.

A streamed domain's arrays live in its host STORE, not on its
``DomainState``.  That is the whole premise -- the state's device arrays are
where the tile buffers came from, not where the domain is -- and every
consumer inside :mod:`tilestream` respects it.  ``woof.core.nest`` does not,
because it predates the mode and had no reason to:

    def _coupled_parent_field(self, kind):          # nest.py:227
        parent_state = self.child_node.parent.state
        ...
        couple_nest_field(parent_state, kind, out=out)

``NestCoupler.force`` reads the PARENT'S DEVICE STATE for every forcing field
-- u, v, w, thp, php, mup and every active moist species.  With the parent
streamed those arrays hold whatever was in them when the store was filled,
so the child is forced from the parent's INITIAL CONDITION for the whole
forecast.  Nothing raises, nothing is NaN, and the child keeps producing
weather: it is exactly the silent-and-plausible failure this project keeps
being caught by.  The same sentence in reverse describes two-way feedback --
``feedback_commit`` MUTATES ``parent.state``, and those writes land on arrays
the streamed parent never reads again.

THE GAP IS UNIMPLEMENTED, NOT STRUCTURAL, AND THE ARITHMETIC SAYS SO
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The reflex is to call this structural: forcing a nest needs the WHOLE parent
and a tile cannot see the whole parent.  The first half is true and the
second does not follow, because the coupler already works ONE FULL FIELD AT A
TIME -- ``_coupled_parent_field`` borrows a single full-parent-shaped prefix
out of the F16 arena, fills it, hands it to ``bdy_interp1``, and reuses the
same backing for the next kind.  So a streamed parent has to materialise one
field, not one state.

One fp32 field of an ``N x N x 49`` domain is ``196 * N^2`` bytes.  Against
20 GiB of usable VRAM that is ``N = 10,100``; against the 44.14 GiB pinned
ceiling a single 32.26 B/cell dry store already tops out at ``N = 5,476``, and
the full carrier set tops out far below that.  The one-field working set is
therefore never the binding constraint in any domain the mode can reach.
What is missing is the copy, and the copy is this module.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS AND IS NOT
------------------------------
:func:`refresh_nest_fields` puts the store's forcing set back onto the state,
field by field, so ``NestCoupler.force`` reads live data;
:func:`commit_nest_fields` sends the same set the other way, so a two-way
feedback the coupler wrote onto the state reaches the store.  Together they
make the coupler's INPUT and OUTPUT correct, and
:func:`tilestream.test_mgphys.nest_probe` proves it bit-for-bit against a
resident run with the no-refresh case as its negative control.

They do NOT make a nested streamed forecast work, and reporting them as if
they did would be the sixth false result.  The executor
(``woof.core.model.execute_experiment``) still calls neither, no route wires
them, and until it does the accurate behaviour for a tree whose parent streams
is REFUSAL -- ``steppers_for_tree`` currently returns a streamed stepper for a
parent with children without comment, which is how a user gets the stale nest
above.  Cost, for the record: one refresh is a whole-domain H2D of the
forcing set (16 fields at ``full(real74)+KF``), i.e. roughly a third of one
sweep's gather traffic, once per parent step.
