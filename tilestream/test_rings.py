"""Tests for :mod:`tilestream.rings` -- the geometry, exhaustively.

The ring scheme's correctness reduces to one statement:

    every cell a LATER tile reads out of an EARLIER tile's write set is in
    the saved bands.

:func:`tilestream.rings.assert_ring_covers_reads` checks that with rectangle
arithmetic.  This module checks the same thing a second, independent way --
by simulating the whole sweep cell by cell on a full-domain numpy array -- so
that a shared mistake in the rectangle algebra cannot make both agree.  The
two must agree on every plan in :data:`PLANS`, which spans periodic and not,
ragged and not, tiles narrower than the halo, and windows that wrap onto
themselves.

Everything here is pure index arithmetic: no GPU, no woof, seconds to run.
The bit-exact end-to-end checks live in ``test_gate``.
