"""A wrfout history frame built straight out of the pinned host store.

``woof.io.wrfout`` builds a frame from a resident ``DomainState`` on the
device: ``_device_state_frame`` reads ~15 to 122 live cupy arrays and the
async writer stages them D2H into pinned buffers.  A streamed run has no such
state.  The domain is in pinned host RAM, one halo tile at a time visits the
GPU, and by the time a history frame is due the only device object in
existence is a tile buffer holding somebody else's window.

This module writes the frame anyway, and it does it without a single byte of
device traffic.

WHERE EVERY FIELD OF A FRAME ACTUALLY COMES FROM
------------------------------------------------
Not transcribed -- MEASURED, by :func:`frame_plan`, which builds the real
``_device_state_frame`` on a live state and matches every field's ``id()``
against the carrier manifest and against ``STATE_SETUP_ARRAYS``.  A
transcribed table would drift the first time a scheme published a new
diagnostic; this one cannot, and it classifies a field it has never heard of
as UNAVAILABLE rather than dropping it.  Four classes come out:

``carrier``
    Already in the store, under the restart member name the store keys it
    by.  Served as a ZERO-COPY view of the pinned buffer -- no copy, no
    allocation, no transfer.  MEASURED: 110 of the 122 fields at
    ``full+MYNN+Noah-MP``, 43 of 55 at ``full(real74) +KF``, 34 of 46 at
    ``mp10``, and 5 of 15 dry (a dry frame is mostly base state).
``setup``
    ``MUB``/``HGT``/``ZNU``/``ZNW``, plus the ``PB``/``PHB`` column
    broadcasts and ``P_TOP``.  Input, not state: materialised once by
    :meth:`tilestream.checkpoint.DomainSetup.output_statics` and reused by
    every frame for the whole run.
``derived``
    ``T = (thb + thp) - 300`` and ``P = p - pb``, and ``PSFC`` on a
    physics-free state.  Computed on the host, into destinations allocated
    once -- see THE TWO WAYS TO GET THE DERIVE WRONG below.
``driver-diagnostic``
    Produced by a physics scheme, published to output, and read back by
    NOTHING -- so ``woof/io/restart.py`` classifies it REBUILT and it is not
    a carrier, so ``tilestream.driver.run_tiled`` neither gathers nor
    scatters it, so after a sweep the tile buffer holds whatever the LAST
    tile wrote.  MEASURED: exactly ONE such field at every shipped rung --
    ``OLR`` -- plus ``XKMH``/``XKHH`` under ``cfg.hmix_k_diag`` and the SASE
    flux rows under SASE.  They are not uncomputable: each tile's own
    radiation call gets its own window right, and
    :func:`diagnostic_inventory` scatters them like carriers for 0.082 B/cell
    (``OLR``, one horizontal plane) or 8.0 B/cell (the eddy-viscosity pair,
    two full 3-D fields).  Without the scatter the published field is the
    last tile's, wrong over 3 of 4 tiles at a 2x2 decomposition.

WHEN THERE IS NO DOMAIN-SHAPED STATE TO CLASSIFY AGAINST
---------------------------------------------------------
:func:`frame_plan` needs a live state, and a STORE-DIRECT run never builds
one.  ``woof.ingest.prepared_store`` fills the store a ROW SLAB at a time
precisely so that no domain-shaped device array is ever allocated, and it
keeps the last slab as a template; the tallest state that exists in such a
run is ``rows`` deep in y.

That template CLASSIFIES the frame perfectly.  The class of a field is a
question about which scheme published it and which object owns the array,
and neither answer varies with how many rows the state has: the ``id()``
match is against the same state's own carrier manifest, so it is internally
consistent at any height.  It SIZES the frame wrong, because ``frame_plan``
records ``np.shape`` of the arrays it matched and those are the slab's.

Only three consumers of ``FramePlan.shape`` exist and all three are in
:class:`StoreFrame`'s constructor: the ``T``/``P`` derive destinations, the
structural-zero rows, and the ``overlap=True`` snapshot buffers.  Nothing
reads a CARRIER's or a SETUP field's recorded shape at all -- a carrier is
served as the store's own array and a setup field comes from
``DomainSetup.output_statics(nz, ny, nx)``, both already at domain extents,
and ``PSFC``'s work plane is sized from ``cfg``.  So a slab-height plan does
not quietly write a subtly wrong frame; it dies with ``non-broadcastable
output operand`` on the first derive, or publishes a ``(rows, nx)``
``RAINNC`` into a ``(ny, nx)`` file.

:func:`domain_frame_plan` is the fix and it invents nothing.  The
classification, the field order and the dtypes are the template's; every
shape is re-read from the STORE for carriers -- definitive, since that array
IS what the frame will hand the writer -- and for everything else mapped onto
``cfg``'s extents by the one rule the whole store rests on, that the
horizontal axes are the last two and an extent one greater than the mass
count is a staggered face.  :func:`store_frame_plan` is the two together.
The gate is that a domain small enough to run both ways gives the identical
frame, which is a statement about bytes and is checked as one.

THE TWO WAYS TO GET THE DERIVE WRONG, BOTH MEASURED
---------------------------------------------------
1. **Reassociating the arithmetic.**  The device computes
   ``(thb + thp) - 300``.  Saving a pass by folding the constant into the
   base state -- ``thp + (thb - 300)`` -- is not the same number: float
   addition is not associative, and it changes **26.2% of T's bytes at
   96x80x49, max |delta| = 1.526e-05 K** (§12.1 reports the same 43.9% at
   256^2).  :func:`derive_t` keeps the device's order.

   The trap sits one level down and :func:`tilestream.test_io.
   negative_reassociated_t` measures it: the difference is **exactly zero on
   a state that has taken one dycore step**, because ``thb - 300`` is exact
   for any ``thb`` in [150, 600] (Sterbenz) and a stepped ``thp`` is 100.00%
   on the representable grid at magnitude 300.  A control that warmed its
   state up first -- which is the normal, careful thing to do here -- would
   certify the reassociated derive.
2. **Allocating the destinations per frame.**  ``np.subtract(a, b)`` without
   ``out=`` first-touches fresh pages every frame; MEASURED 2.7x the cost of
   writing into a preallocated buffer, all of it page faulting.
   :class:`StoreFrame` allocates ``T``/``P`` and the ``PSFC`` work plane once.

AND THE THIRD, WHICH IS NOT ARITHMETIC AT ALL
---------------------------------------------
**Field presentation order is essential.**  The frame dict doubles as the
writer's schema, so it fixes the order ``WrfoutWriter`` creates netCDF
variables in, and HDF5 lays its name heap out in creation order.  The same
data in a different order gives a file that is 189 bytes larger and hashes
differently while every variable in it compares equal -- MEASURED, constant
at 189 bytes from 192^2 to 256^2.  :class:`FramePlan` therefore carries the
device frame's own iteration order and :meth:`StoreFrame.fields` yields it.

WHEN A FRAME MAY BE TAKEN
-------------------------
``run_tiled``'s ``write_mode="ring"`` keeps ONE store and every tile reads and
writes it in the same sweep, so a reader that looks mid-sweep sees mixed
generations: MEASURED 1 clean snapshot in 9 tiles, i.e. a consistent window of
zero duration.  ``write_mode="shadow"`` leaves the caller's store untouched
for a whole sweep and then makes it the next sweep's scatter target, which is
9 clean in 9 for one sweep in two -- still shorter than the 7-9 timesteps a
frame takes to write.  A frame is therefore taken at a SWEEP BOUNDARY under
either mode, and that is the only rule this module imposes.  Two ways to spend
it:

* ``overlap=False`` (default) -- serve the carriers as zero-copy views and
  write synchronously between sweeps.  Zero extra host RAM, and the netCDF
  write is on the critical path.  At forecast cadence that write is 0.077% of
  wall time at hourly output and 0.31% at every 60 steps, so this is the
  right default and the "streaming makes output cheaper" question is not
  worth optimising.
* ``overlap=True`` -- snapshot the volatile carriers into a second set of
  destinations and hand them to the writer thread, which then genuinely
  overlaps the next sweep (netCDF4/HDF5 release the GIL; Phase 1 measured 97%
  overlap efficiency).  The price is a host memcpy of every volatile field
  plus a second copy of them in the RAM the ring scheme exists to conserve.
  ``T`` and ``P`` are free either way: they are derived into their own
  destinations, which IS a snapshot.

MEASURED FRAME COST, mp10 (46 fields), AGAINST THE RESIDENT PATH
----------------------------------------------------------------
The resident path is what ``AsyncDomainWrfoutWriter.submit`` does: device
derive, then D2H into RECYCLED pinned destinations on a side stream.  Recycled
matters -- a COLD pinned allocation is 100.48 ms against 0.04 ms recycled, and
timing the cold one is the artefact that produced this project's seventh false
result.  Both paths are timed to the same endpoint, a complete host frame dict
ready for ``WrfoutWriter``, because the netCDF write that follows is
measurably identical for both (§12.3: the two write medians differ by 2.3-6.2%
while their own spreads are 11-51%).

transfer for nothing, and can only buy the concurrency back at host memory
bandwidth, which on this box is 17-18 GB/s against PCIe 5.0's 50-57.  Against
a solver step of ~3.3 ns/cell dry and ~19 with physics, even the dear branch
is one step's worth of work per frame.
