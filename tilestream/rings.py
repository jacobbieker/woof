"""Halo rings instead of a full shadow: one domain store plus ~6% of a second.

:mod:`tilestream.driver`'s ``write_mode="shadow"`` is correct and costs a
whole second copy of the domain.  That doubling is what sets the largest
runnable domain, because the host store is the binding constraint (see
:mod:`tilestream.hoststore`): at 32.26 B/cell dry and a 44.14 GiB pinned
ceiling, a single store holds 5476^2 x 49 and a shadow pair only 3872^2.

This module removes the doubling.  It is pure index arithmetic plus a thin
block-copy executor; it never decides WHEN anything runs -- ``run_tiled``
does that -- but it does decide WHAT has to be saved, and that is the entire
correctness argument, so the argument is written out here in full.


THE READ-AT-TIME-t RULE, AND WHY A RING IS ENOUGH
-------------------------------------------------
Every tile must see its neighbours as they were at the START of the sweep.
With one store, a tile that scatters its interior in place destroys exactly
that.  But it does not destroy all of it: a tile's interior splits into

* cells some OTHER tile will read this sweep -- always within the tile's
  outer band, because a neighbour's compute window only reaches ``halo``
  cells in (and the exact reach is computed here, not assumed); and
* a CORE that no other tile ever reads.

The core can be overwritten the instant the tile is stepped.  The band -- the
RING -- has to survive until every tile that reads it has read it.  So::

    gather tile j from the store        (may contain already-written cells)
    save   tile j's own ring            (still time-t: nobody has written it)
    patch  tile j's window from the rings of the tiles already written
    step   tile j
    scatter tile j's whole interior back into the store, in place

After gather+patch the tile's window holds time-t values EVERYWHERE, which is
the invariant :func:`assert_ring_covers_reads` proves for a plan and the gate
proves numerically against a monolithic run.

Note what the patch buys beyond memory: it makes the gather's result
independent of whether the racing scatter has landed yet.  A cell the gather
may have read at ``t + dt`` is exactly a cell in some already-written tile's
ring, and the patch overwrites it with the saved ``t`` value either way.


THE FOUR WAYS TO GET THIS SUBTLY WRONG
--------------------------------------
Each of these is silent: the run completes, the fields look like weather, and
only a bit-exact comparison against a monolithic run says otherwise.

1. **A ring of exactly ``halo`` cells is too narrow for the staggered
   variants at the periodic seam.**  A tile whose window ends at mass cell
   ``j1 + halo`` reads ``v`` faces up to and INCLUDING ``j1 + halo`` -- one
   more point than the mass window, because the closing face belongs to the
   next cell.  Wrapped around the seam that lands on face ``halo`` of the
   first tile row, which an ``halo``-wide band does not contain.  MEASURED:
   ``margin_mode="halo"`` leaves 192 such cells unsaved on a 192^2 3x3 plan
   and 9,344 on a ragged 200x192 one.

   AND IT IS BIT-EXACT ANYWAY, at halo 14, 15 and 16 alike -- the dropped
   cells sit at the OUTER edge of the reading tile's window, outside the
   influence cone that decides that tile's interior.  So this failure is
   invisible to the hash gate at every halo that produces a correct answer at
   all, and :func:`assert_ring_covers_reads` is the only instrument that sees
   it.  That is the reason the margins come from the plan's OWN gather
   rectangles, per variant, and never from the halo width: the alternative is
   sound only by an accident nothing tests.

2. **A non-periodic edge tile reaches ``2*halo`` into its neighbour.**
   :mod:`tilestream.spec` clamps an edge window by SLIDING it inward rather
   than truncating it, so tile 0's window is ``[0, tile + 2*halo)`` and
   overlaps its right neighbour by ``2*halo``, not ``halo``.  Same cure: the
   reach is measured from the plan.

3. **A compute window wider than the domain reads every tile's core.**
   ``cnx > nx`` (a plan with one tile in x, or a tile+halo bigger than the
   domain) wraps the window onto itself, so "only the outer band is read" is
   simply false and the whole interior has to be saved.  The greedy margin
   search arrives at that on its own because it is driven by the actual
   intersections; the erosion formula in the old
   ``driver.ring_bytes_vs_shadow`` estimate would not have.

4. **The two cross-tile hazards are on DIFFERENT CUDA streams.**  Ordering
   inside a stream is free; between streams there is none, and both of the
   orderings this scheme needs are between streams:

   * WAR on the store -- tile j's gather (j < k) READS cells that tile k's
     scatter WRITES.  There is no patch for this direction (tile k's ring is
     not saved until tile k is gathered), so the read must happen first.
   * RAW on the ring arena -- tile k's save WRITES a band that tile j's patch
     (j > k) READS.

   It is tempting to argue that this card satisfies both for free:
   ``asyncEngineCount == 1`` means one DMA queue drained in submission order,
   and the loop submits in tile order.  THAT ARGUMENT IS FALSE, and it was
   measured to be false rather than reasoned away.  Running the gate's 3x3
   plan with the events removed (``run_tiled(ring_ordering="submission")``)
   is BIT-EXACT on an idle card and WRONG BY 3.7e+02 while another process
   shares the GPU -- same code, same machine, hours apart.  The submission
   order is a property of an uncontended card, so a run that relied on it
   would corrupt intermittently, as a function of what else the machine was
   doing.  ``run_tiled`` therefore records one event per tile and waits on
   the few neighbours that matter: :attr:`RingPlan.war_deps` and
   :attr:`RingPlan.patch_deps` are those neighbour lists, and they are the
   reason this scheme is safe rather than lucky.

A fifth, which the loop rather than this module has to honour: the ring holds
time-t values for ONE sweep.  Nothing may be prefetched across a sweep
boundary, and the arena is refilled every sweep.


WHAT IT COSTS
-------------
Only the bands read by a LATER tile need saving; a band read by an earlier
tile is protected by the WAR ordering instead.  In row-major order that is
the top and right bands of a typical tile (plus the bottom of row 0 and the
left of column 0, which the periodic wrap makes "later"), i.e. about half of
the full frame the naive estimate assumed.  MEASURED as arena bytes over store
bytes at halo 16: 4.97% at 1950^2 tile 650, 5.84% at 3276^2 tile 546, 2.39% at
5412^2 tile 1353 -- against 100% for the shadow, and against the ~10-13% a
four-sided ``interior - erosion(halo)`` estimate predicts for the same plans.

A tile size that does NOT divide the domain is far dearer, because a ragged
trailing tile is narrower than its neighbours' windows and so is read right
through: 3276^2 at tile 512 leaves 13 ragged tiles and costs 24.46%, against
5.84% at tile 546, which divides it exactly.  A 6.6% change in tile size, a
4.2x change in the arena.

    on purpose, and what they do to the ANSWER is not what one would guess:

    ``"exact"``
        Every margin comes from the intersections of the plan's own gather
        and scatter rectangles.  Provably sufficient, and SMALLER than the
        naive frame (44,862 saved cells against 67,200 on a 192^2 3x3 plan),
        because a band only a preceding tile reads is not saved at all.

    ``"halo"``
        A band exactly ``spec.halo`` wide on all four sides -- the plausible
        mistake.  It genuinely violates the invariant: MEASURED 192 cells on
        a 192^2 3x3 plan, 9,280 on a ragged 200x192 one, which
        :func:`assert_ring_covers_reads` reports and refuses.  And yet it is
        BIT-EXACT against a monolithic run at halo 14, 15 and 16 alike.  The
        cells it misses are the staggered closing face and the deep reach of
        a ragged tile, both of which sit at the OUTER edge of the reading
        tile's window, outside the influence cone that decides that tile's
        interior.  So this mode is the demonstration that the hash gate
        CANNOT see this class of error and the geometric invariant is not
        redundant with it.  Do not conclude that the naive ring is fine: it
        is unsound at any halo, and its soundness margin is invisible.

    ``"x_only"``
        Margins in x only, i.e. the mistake of thinking about the x seam and
        forgetting the y one.  This one does change the answer, in any plan
        with a y seam, which is what makes it the negative control the gate

    fits.  It is NOT necessarily the largest that fits, and the reason is
    worth stating because it is the whole tile-choice story: the footprint is
    not monotone in ``n``.  A domain the tile size divides exactly has no
    ragged tiles and a small ring; one cell more adds a trailing strip that
    its neighbours' windows read right through, so the whole strip has to be
    saved and the arena jumps.  MEASURED at ``nz=49`` dry, tile 1024:
    ``n = 5120`` (5 x 5 tiles, none ragged) needs an arena of 3.14% of the
    store, while nearby ragged sizes need 20-40%.  So this bisects and then
    scans upward for a larger size that happens to fit; and a caller who can
    choose both should choose ``n`` and ``tile`` together, with ``tile``
