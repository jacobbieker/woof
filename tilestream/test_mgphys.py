"""Multi-GPU streaming with PHYSICS ON: the composition nobody had run.

:mod:`tilestream.test_mgstream` proved the TRANSPORT -- N GPUs pulling tiles
out of one pinned host store reproduce a monolithic run bit for bit.  Every
arm of it is DRY: nine arrays, no ``PhysicsDriver``, no scalar clock, no
lazily-allocated carriers, no geography.  :mod:`tilestream.test_gate` proved
the opposite half -- the whole 139-to-229 carrier set streamed bit-exactly
through ONE GPU at fourteen physics rungs -- and every arm of THAT is single
device.  The product of the two had never been run, and that product is what
a user actually asks for.

WHAT THE COMPOSITION ADDS, and why each one could have been silently wrong
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
*The tile buffer.*  ``mgstream.run_mgstream`` hard-wired
``factory = driver.make_tile_state``, which attaches no driver, so
``dycore.step`` raised at every rung above dry and the multi-GPU path was
mechanically incapable of running physics.  That is a one-line seam
(``tile_state_factory=``, the same one ``run_tiled`` has had since
driver.py:1115) and it is the only edit this module needed.

*The clock.*  ``dycore.step`` advances ``elapsed_seconds`` per CALL and every
cadence test is a function of it, so the domain clock has to be reset onto a
buffer before each tile and advanced exactly once per sweep.  With ONE thread
that is a loop invariant.  With one thread per GPU it is a shared mutable
object written by worker 0 between two barriers and read by every worker, and
the failure mode is that two cards evaluate different due-flags for the same
sweep -- one integrates radiation, the other does not, and the digest is
wrong in a way that looks like weather.  ``driver._advance_clock`` cross-
checks every buffer of every worker against one reference, so a disagreement
raises instead of scattering.

*The ring arena, across devices.*  ``rings.RingArena`` mirrors the STORE's
memory class, so for the pinned host store this module runs on, the arena is
pinned host memory and both cards DMA into the same pages.  That is why one
arena can serve every device.  It also means the cross-device ordering is a
real ordering problem rather than an impossible-by-construction one, which is
what the negative control below exists to prove.

THE CADENCE TRAP, which this project has fallen into three times
----------------------------------------------------------------
``full(real74) +KF`` has ``radt=12 min`` and ``cudt=5 min``.  At ``dt=3 s``
that is one radiation call every 240 steps and one cumulus call every 100.
An 8-step window fires radiation ZERO times on BOTH sides, so a clock bug, a
cadence disagreement between two cards, and a transport that drops the
radiation tendencies are all invisible -- and the run passes.  Every arm here
therefore runs the ``full fast cadence`` rung (``radt=0.05 min``,
``cudt=0.1 min``, ``bldt=1.0 min``) and PRINTS the radiation and cumulus fire
counts of the monolithic reference AND of the arm being compared to it.  An
arm whose fire counts are zero is reported as no evidence, not as a pass.

THE NEGATIVE CONTROLS ARE THE POINT
-----------------------------------
A bit-exact two-GPU physics result is exactly the shape of good news this
project has been wrong about six times.  The specific way it would be wrong
here is that the ordering being credited was never essential: two workers
that happen to run far enough apart give the right answer for the wrong
reason, and the ``cudaStreamWaitEvent``-on-an-unrecorded-event hazard
``mgstream`` documents is silent by construction.  So each arm is also run
BROKEN:

``shadow``  ``sweep_barrier=False``
    drops the one barrier the parallel path has.
``ring``    ``cross_worker_sync="none"``
    drops the host-side "this event has been RECORDED" handshake and keeps the
    CUDA wait, which is then a no-op on an unrecorded event.
both        ``carry_scalars=False``
    drops the domain clock, which at the fast cadence makes every tile
    evaluate a different due-flag.  This is the control that proves the
    comparison can see PHYSICS at all rather than only the dycore.

A control that does not fire is reported as a FAILED CONTROL, never as a
pass.

    """Whether a nest can be forced from a parent that is being streamed.

    A full two-domain tree needs a ``DomainConfig`` pair, two
    ``LambertGrid``s, a ``Schedule``, two ``DomainClock``s and the executor.
    None of that changes the answer, because the entire parent-facing surface
    of the coupler is one line -- ``couple_nest_field(parent.state, kind,
    out=...)``, nest.py:244 -- and this probe runs THAT line, on a real
    streamed parent, before and after a real multi-GPU sweep.

    Three digests, and the verdict is which two agree:

    ``t0``      the coupled forcing fields at the start of the window.
    ``resident``  the same fields after ``nsteps`` of a RESIDENT run: what the
                child must be forced with.
    ``streamed``  the same fields read off the state the coupler would read,
                after the same ``nsteps`` streamed across ``ngpu`` cards.

    ``streamed == t0`` is the gap: the store advanced and the coupler's input
    did not.  ``streamed == resident`` after :func:`tilestream.nestbridge
    .refresh_nest_fields` is the fix.  Both are asserted, because a fix whose
    control does not fire is not a fix.
