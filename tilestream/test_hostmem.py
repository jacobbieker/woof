"""``hoststore.host_memory`` answers on every platform the product ships on.

THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR
--------------------------
``tilestream/hoststore.py`` read ``/proc/meminfo`` unconditionally, so on
Windows -- the platform the product's own front door ships on, and the one
the cut box runs -- EVERY ``HostDomainStore`` construction died in
``check_allocatable`` with ``FileNotFoundError: /proc/meminfo`` before a
single byte was pinned.  Seven of ``tilestream/test_hoststore.py``'s eight
gates failed on that one line, and the out-of-core host store -- the module
that makes a larger-than-VRAM domain possible at all -- was unusable on the
machine it was built for.  ``tilestream/autoplan.py`` had already grown the
``GlobalMemoryStatusEx`` branch for exactly this reason (its module
docstring: "a planner that had no host source on Windows did not fall back
to a guess, it RAISED"); the store never inherited it.

This file is SEPARATE from ``test_hoststore.py`` on purpose: that module's
helpers import cupy, so the whole module is auto-marked ``gpu`` and the
stage-1 leg (GPUWM_NO_LOCAL_GPU=1, the Windows cut box) skips it.  The
host-memory read needs no card, and the box that needs this gate most is
exactly the one the gpu shard never runs on -- so the gate lives where the
CPU leg can see it.
