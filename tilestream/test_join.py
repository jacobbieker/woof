"""THE JOIN, through WOOF's own seam: a real forecast configuration streamed.

Real Lambert projection, real terrain, SPECIFIED lateral boundaries, full
physics, the whole domain in pinned host RAM, one tile of it on the card at a
time -- and bit-exact against the same configuration integrated as one
resident block.  Geography had been proven on PERIODIC domains; lateral
boundaries had been proven on FLAT UNPROJECTED ones; a real forecast is the
intersection and it had never been run.

It is driven through :func:`woof.core.streaming.make_stepper`, which is the
callable WOOF's own run loops step a domain with
(:func:`woof.core.model.execute_experiment`'s STEP op and
:func:`woof.runtime.integrate_prepared_case`'s substep both call it and
nothing else).  So the object under test here is the object the model runs,
not a lookalike: the loop below is the model's loop with the output, restart,
health and nest-coupling ops removed, because this module is a bit-exactness
gate and those ops are proven elsewhere (``tilestream/test_io.py``,
``tilestream/test_restart_gate.py``).

    python -m tilestream.test_join            # the whole gate
    python -m tilestream.test_join --quick    # dry + the top rung only


THREE THINGS THAT ARE TRUE HERE AND WERE TRUE IN NEITHER PREVIOUS LANE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  ``periodic_faces=False``.  ``harness.make_geography``'s default
    duplicates the closing map-factor faces (``msfu[:, nx] = msfu[:, 0]``)
    because on a periodic domain ``TileSpec._axis_gather`` reduces every
    window mod nx and never reads the alias slot, so the domain's column
    ``nx`` must equal its column 0 or a tile and a monolithic run disagree
    about a face that physically IS the same face.  On a SPECIFIED domain
    column ``nx`` is a real east boundary face ``dx*nx`` away from column 0
    and ``TileSpec.owns_x_alias`` becomes ``i1 == nx`` -- the east-edge tile
    really does gather and scatter it.  Duplicating would install the WEST
    edge's map factor on the EAST edge.  :func:`periodic_face_lie` MEASURES
    how big that lie is instead of asserting that it matters: 0.245% of
    msfv at the closing face, equating two columns 1800 km and 21.1 degrees
    of longitude apart.

2.  Tiles that own TRUE DOMAIN EDGES and tiles that own only interior seams
    exist in the same plan (measured on the gate's own geometry: 24 tiles
    with no true edge, 20 with one, 4 with two).  A tile's true edges take
    the domain's own boundary tables windowed along the tangential axis; its
    interior seams take inert tables.

3.  ``elapsed_seconds`` drives ``dtbc`` (lateral_bc.py:373-378) on top of
    every physics cadence, so it must be carried per tile even at the DRY
    rung, where the previous lanes had no scalar carriers at all.


THE CONTROLS, AND WHAT EACH ONE IS FOR
--------------------------------------
This project has produced six false results and every one of them was caught
by a control.  Each capability here ships with a test that fails when the
capability is removed:

``periodic faces``      duplicate the closing faces -> must DIFFER
``per-tile windowing``  give every tile the domain's tables -> must DIFFER
``true-edge tables``    scale a true edge by 1.000001 -> must DIFFER
``the clock``           stop carrying elapsed_seconds -> must DIFFER
``geography``           let each tile rebuild its own -> must DIFFER
``the halo``            one cell below the measured margin -> must DIFFER
``interior seams``      zeros / self-consistent / GARBAGE -> must AGREE

The last is the one the mode rests on, and it is stated the strong way
round: a seam filled with 1e6 in coupled units and 1e4/s of tendency gives
the bit-identical answer, so the seam relaxation provably cannot reach the
interior at the halo ``harness.halo_radius`` prescribes.
