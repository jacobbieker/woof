"""Domain-wide FP64 receipts for a domain that is streamed, not resident.

WOOF's conservation receipts are whole-domain SUMS, and that one word is
what separates them from every other observer this transport has had to
carry.  A max or an OR folds over tiles for free -- ``max`` is associative
AND idempotent, so a tile overlap costs nothing and the tile order does not
matter.  A SUM is associative in exact arithmetic and NOT in floating point,
and it double-counts whatever the tiles overlap in.  Both halves of that bite
here, and they bite differently.

TWO DEFECTS, AND THE SECOND SURVIVES FIXING THE FIRST
-----------------------------------------------------
*Stale state.*  A streamed domain's carriers live in the store; the
``DomainState`` the model still holds is the one the store was FILLED FROM
and it is never stepped again.  So ``dycore.domain_mass_measure(state)`` on a
streamed run returns the t=0 mass, forever, with no error and no NaN.
MEASURED, 256x192x49, 24 steps, periodic: the resident run ends at
3205297165.2070312 and the state-read receipt returns 3205297165.3867188 --
the t=0 value exactly, 376832 ulp away (1223182 ulp on the mapped domain).  A
receipt like that does not look broken.  It looks like a beautifully
conserved domain.

*Reduction order.*  Fix the first defect the obvious way -- fold each tile's
contribution as the sweep goes past -- and the number comes back differing in
the last few ulp from the resident run's, because 16 partial sums rounded and
then added is not the same rounding as one sum of 49152 terms.  Every other
streaming result in this project is stated as BIT-EXACT.  A conservation
receipt that disagrees in the last ulp looks exactly like a transport bug,
and chasing one costs a day.

So this module computes the receipts from the STORE, in the MONOLITHIC
TRAVERSAL ORDER -- one reduction over the whole (ny, nx) plane, the same
reduction the resident run does -- and does not fold per tile.  That is a
deliberate policy, not an implementation accident, and it is stated here
because the number is produced here.

WHY THE OUT-OF-CORE PREMISE DOES NOT FORBID IT
----------------------------------------------
"The domain does not fit on the card" is a statement about the 3-D carriers.
The dry-mass measure is a 2-D integral: ``sum(mu / msft**2)`` over (ny, nx).
The largest domain the planner will build -- 5476^2 x 49 against a 44 GiB
pinned host ceiling -- puts 30.0 M columns, 240 MB of FP64, on the GPU for
that reduction.  2-D always fits.  A receipt that IS 3-D does not get this
escape, which is why ``cfg.tke_budget`` is refused below rather than
reimplemented.

WHAT THE FOLD ACTUALLY COSTS, MEASURED
--------------------------------------
Both legs on the same values, 256x192x49, 24 steps, 4x4 tiles that divide the
domain exactly, interiors partitioning it with no overlap.  Every number is
one association of the SAME 49152 terms against the monolithic reduction, and
the survey row folds the same values over six different partitions -- 2x2,
4x4, 8x8, 16x16, per-row, per-column -- because one draw invites the reader
to conclude "0 ulp, folding is fine":

====================================  ====  ==================  ==============
configuration                            N  the 4x4 fold        6-fold survey
====================================  ====  ==================  ==============
periodic, ``map_proj=0``, flat          24  0 ulp               all six 0
periodic, real Lambert + real terrain   24  +1 ulp, 4.77e-07    +1 +1 -1 +2
                                            abs, 1.52e-16 rel   -2 -1 (max 2)
periodic, real Lambert + real terrain    8  0 ulp               0 0 -2 -1 0
                                                                -4 (max 4)
====================================  ====  ==================  ==============

The first row is a TRAP and is recorded so nobody re-derives it as
reassurance.  Under the milestone-one settings ``msft == 1`` exactly, so
``cell_area_weight`` is exactly 1.0; every term is then an FP32 column mass,
a multiple of 2**-7 near 65000, and the whole 49152-term sum needs 39 bits.
It is EXACT in FP64, so no association can change it and the zero says
nothing about associativity.  The second row is the real answer: with
``map_proj=1`` the weight ``1/msft**2`` carries a full FP64 mantissa, the sum
rounds, and folding moves it -- by up to 4 ulp, in a direction and by an
amount that depend on the partition AND on the step count.  That wandering is
itself the finding: the number a folded receipt returns is not a property of
the domain, it is a property of the tiling, and the SAME tiling gives a
different answer at a different N.  Nothing about the transport moves.

4 ulp is 2e-6 of a domain mass whose 24-step CHANGE is -0.583, so the fold is
physically irrelevant and diagnostically fine.  It is the bit-exactness claim
it destroys, and that claim is the only reason anyone trusts this mode.

THREE RECEIPTS THIS MODULE REFUSES INSTEAD OF PRODUCING
-------------------------------------------------------
Refusal is a design choice here, and the alternative is not "produce nothing"
-- it is "produce a plausible wrong number", which is what the code does
today.  Each refusal names what a caller would have to build.

``cfg.tke_budget`` (``woof.core.tke_budget``)
    A 3-D VOLUME integral accumulated by a device kernel INSIDE
    ``dycore.step``, into ``state._scratch['tke_budget_acc']``.  Under
    streaming that step runs on the TILE, so the accumulation lands on the
    tile buffer; the slot is classified REBUILT (``woof/io/restart.py``
    ``REBUILT_SCRATCH_PREFIXES``), so it is not a carrier and is neither
    gathered nor scattered.  MEASURED, 24 steps, 16 tiles, 2 buffers: the
    domain state's ``drain`` returns ``None`` (it never stepped), each buffer
    holds 192 accumulated steps rather than 24, and summing the two buffers
    gives 0.311x the resident volume integral on every physical term --
    because a buffer's reduction covers its GATHERED window, halo included,
    at a redundancy of 2.5, divided by 8x the step count.  ``transport`` is
    worse than scaled: -1.9e+06 times the resident value, sign flipped,
    because a tile's window edges carry an advective flux divergence that
    telescopes away only over the whole domain.  Making this right needs an
    interior mask inside the accumulate kernel plus a domain-level
    accumulator the tiles reduce into -- a kernel change, not a wrapper.

``mass_flux_observer`` / ``mass_flux_accumulator``
    The telescoped lateral flux, sampled per acoustic substep from the
    state's OUTERMOST FACES.  It cannot be taken from the store at all: it
    reads ``u_pp``/``v_pp``, which are within-step acoustic scratch and do
    not exist at any point where the store is coherent.  Taken per tile it is
    wrong twice over -- ``_boundary_x(cfg)`` is a CONFIG property, so every
    tile believes all four of its window sides are domain edges, and under
    ``periodic=False`` neighbouring tiles' clamped windows overlap along the
    same domain edge by ``2*halo`` rows, so even the true edges double-count.
    :meth:`tilestream.driver.TiledRun.sweep` refuses both keywords for that
    reason.

``hmix_k_diag`` / ``sase_flux_diag``
    Not reductions at all -- (nz, ny, nx) and (nz+1, ny, nx) output fields on
    the ``PhysicsDriver``.  ``woof/io/restart.py`` classifies both
    output-only and ``tilestream.physics_inventory.OUTPUT_ONLY_DRIVER_ATTRS``
    already records the streaming consequence: they are neither gathered nor
    scattered, so under tiling each holds whatever the last tile through that
    buffer wrote.  Trajectory-inert, diagnostically wrong, and out of this
    module's scope because there is nothing to sum.
