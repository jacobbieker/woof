"""Attribute a streamed step's wall clock BEFORE building the overlap.

    python -m tilestream.overlap_attrib --config CFG [--tile N] [--nbuffers B]
        [--steps 12] [--warmup 2] [--json OUT.json]

The question this answers, per model step of the PRODUCTION streamed path
(:func:`woof.core.streaming.prepared_domain_builder` -> ``attach`` ->
``StreamedDomain.__call__``, one sweep per step, exactly as
``execute_experiment`` drives it):

*   how much of the wall clock is COMPUTE (``dycore.step`` on tile buffers),
*   how much is TRANSFER, split H2D carrier gather / D2H scatter / geography
    gather / ring save / ring patch,
*   how much of the transfer is EXPOSED -- device transfer time during which
    no compute interval is running -- versus hidden under compute,
*   and how much is the three named host-side candidates: the ``tile_hook``
    bind (the eager ``attach_lateral_boundaries`` re-upload),
    ``_advance_clock``'s per-buffer scalar readback, and
    ``set_carrier_scalars``.

MEASURED, not inferred: every device-side category is bracketed by CUDA
events recorded on the operation's own stream and reduced against a per-step
origin event; host-side categories are ``perf_counter`` around the exact
call.  The instrument changes no arithmetic and no issue order -- wrappers
call straight through -- and its own overhead is stated by running the same
window uninstrumented first (``--control``).

The exposure arithmetic is interval arithmetic, not subtraction of sums:
``exposed = |union(transfer) - union(compute)|``, so three-deep transfer
overlap is not triple-counted and transfer under compute is not blamed.

Nothing here is case-specific; the config is whatever woof TOML the caller
hands in.  ``asyncEngineCount`` and the device identity are printed with the
result because the overlap ceiling is a property of THIS card: one copy
engine still overlaps one copy with compute, it just cannot overlap H2D with
D2H as well.
