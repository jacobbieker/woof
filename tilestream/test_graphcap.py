"""Tests for the graph-capture machinery and for the deferred health ledger.

The bit-exact end-to-end proof lives in ``test_gate --graph-only``: fourteen
rungs, real geography, ring and shadow, N = 1 / 3 / 8, every digest compared
against a monolithic run, plus the two negative controls that show the cache
key and the scalar replay are essential.  This module tests the pieces the
gate cannot isolate, and every test here is written so that it FAILS if the
mechanism is switched off or subtly weakened rather than merely absent.

The one that matters most is
:func:`test_a_clean_tile_must_not_erase_a_dirty_tile_s_flag`.  The ledger
accumulates a scheme's status word with OR, and OR is not an implementation
detail: a sweep runs many TILES through one ledger, so a store instead of an
accumulate would let tile 3's clean status overwrite tile 1's non-finite one
and the run would continue with a NaN in it and no error.  That failure is
invisible to any bit-exactness test, because a run that should have aborted
and did not still produces a digest.

Run it::

    python -m tilestream.test_graphcap
